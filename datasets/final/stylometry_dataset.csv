dostoevsky,"oceanofpdf.com i i n the beginning of july, during an extremely hot spell, toward evening, a young man left his tiny room, which he sublet from some tenants who lived in stolyarnyi lane, stepped out onto the street, and slowly, as if indecisively, set off towards the kokushkin bridge. he had successfully managed to avoid meeting his landlady on the staircase. his small room, more like a closet than an apartment, was tucked under the roof of a tall five-story building. the landlady of the apartment, who rented him this room and provided both dinner and a servant, lived below in a separate apartment on the same staircase; every time he left to go out, he had to pass the landlady’s kitchen door, which was almost always left open onto the landing. every time the young man passed, he felt a painful and fearful sensation, one that he was ashamed of and that made him wince. he was deeply in debt to the landlady and was afraid to face her. it wasn’t that he was so fearful and cowed; in fact, it was just the opposite; but for some time he had been in an irritable and anxious state, similar to hypochondria. he had become so absorbed in himself and so isolated from others that he was afraid of meeting anyone, not only his landlady. he was crushed by poverty, but even his constrained circumstances had ceased to burden him of late. he had completely stopped handling his own everyday affairs and didn’t wish to deal with them. he was not actually afraid of his landlady, no matter what she intended to do to him. but to stop on the staircase, put up with all sorts of nonsense about ordinary rubbish that didn’t concern him at all, her constant pestering about payment, her threats and complaints, and, in the face of it all, to have to dodge her, make excuses, tell lies—no thank you; it was better to slip past somehow, like a cat on a staircase, and steal away unnoticed. however, this time the fear of meeting his creditor surprised even him as he made his way out to the street. “what sort of feat am i about to attempt, yet at the same time i’m afraid of such nonsense!” he thought with a strange smile. “hmm . . . yes . . . everything lies in a man’s hands, and still he lets it slip by, solely out of cowardice . . . that’s an axiom. . . . it would be interesting to know what people fear the most. most of all they fear taking a new step, uttering a new word of their own. . . . but i’m babbling too much. it’s because i’m not doing anything that i’m babbling. that may be the case: i’m babbling because i’m not doing anything. and it’s in the last month i’ve learned to prattle, lying for days and nights in my corner, thinking about . . . ‘once upon a time. . . .’ well, why am i going out now? can i really be capable of doing that ? is that really serious? no, it’s not serious at all. so, i’m amusing myself for the sake of fantasy: games! yes, that’s it, games!” it was stiflingly hot outside; moreover, the stuffiness, the crush of people, lime plaster everywhere, scaffolding, bricks, dust, and that particular summer stench, so familiar to every petersburg resident lacking the means to rent a summer dacha—all this suddenly and offensively struck the young man’s already distraught nerves. the unbearable stench of cheap taverns, which were particularly numerous in this part of the city, and the drunkards encountered constantly, despite its being a weekday, completed the repulsive and grim scene. for a moment, a feeling of the deepest loathing flashed across the young man’s delicate features. incidentally, he was remarkably handsome, with splendid dark eyes and dark brown hair; he was taller than average, slender, and well built. but soon he seemed to slip into profound pensiveness, even, it would be more accurate to say, into a state of oblivion. he walked along not noticing his surroundings, not even wanting to take notice of them. from time to time he merely muttered something to himself, from his penchant for monologues, which he immediately acknowledged to himself. at that moment he himself was aware that at times his thoughts were confused and that he was feeling very weak: it was the second day he’d eaten hardly anything at all. he was so poorly dressed that someone else, even someone used to seeing such, would be ashamed to appear on the street during the day wearing such ragged clothes. however, the district was one where it was difficult to shock anyone with one’s apparel. the proximity of the haymarket, the abundance of certain establishments, and, primarily, the population of tradesmen and craftsmen, all crowded into these streets and lanes of central petersburg, sometimes filled the general panorama with such subjects that it would be strange to be surprised at all on meeting another such figure. but so much malicious contempt had already accumulated in the young man’s soul that, in spite of all his own sometimes very immature squeamishness, when he was out on the street he was not in the least embarrassed by his tattered clothes. it was another matter altogether when he met some of his acquaintances or former comrades, whom, in general, he didn’t much like seeing. . . . however, when one drunkard, who for some unknown reason was being transported somewhere along the street in an enormous cart harnessed to a huge dray horse, suddenly shouted to him, in passing, “hey, you, you german hatmaker!” and roared as loud as he could, pointing his finger at him—the young man suddenly stopped and violently grabbed his own hat. it was a tall, round top hat bought at zimmerman’s shop, but already worn out, and now of a completely faded reddish-brown color,"
dostoevsky,"with many holes and stains, lacking a brim, and leaning to one side at a most unattractive angle. however, it was not shame that seized him but a completely different feeling, more resembling fear. “i knew it!” he muttered in confusion. “that’s exactly what i thought! this is the most disgraceful part! it’s just this kind of foolish thing, a really trivial detail that can spoil the whole plan! yes, a hat that’s too noticeable. . . . it’s funny-looking, and therefore noticeable. . . . with my tattered clothes i really need a peaked cap, even an old one, flat as a pancake, not this monstrosity. no one wears hats like this; it can be recognized a mile away and remembered . . . that’s the main thing, remembered afterward, and there’s your evidence. one has to be as inconspicuous as possible. . . . details, details are the main thing! it’s the details that always ruin everything . . .” he had only a little way to go; he even knew exactly how many paces it was from the gate of his own building: seven hundred and thirty. once, when entirely lost in his daydreams, he’d happened to count them. at the time he himself still didn’t believe in his dreams and was merely irritating himself with their repugnant, though seductive audacity. now, however, a month later, he’d begun to regard them in a different light, and in spite of all his mocking monologues about his own powerlessness and indecisiveness, he’d grown accustomed, even against his will, to considering this “repulsive” dream something of a feat, although he still didn’t believe in it himself. now he was even on his way to carry out a trial run of his endeavor; with every step his agitation grew stronger and stronger. with a sinking heart and nervous trembling, he approached an immense building, one wall of which opened onto a narrow canal, the other onto sadovaya street. this building consisted of small apartments inhabited by all sorts of tradesmen—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, various germans, streetwalkers, low-ranking civil servants, and others. people entering and leaving the building kept darting under both gates and across both courtyards. three or four doormen worked there. the young man was very pleased when he didn’t encounter any of them and managed to slip unnoticed right through the gates and directly onto the staircase. the staircase was dark and narrow, “a back entrance,” but he knew that already, having studied it, and he liked this whole setting: in such darkness even casting a curious glance wouldn’t be dangerous. “if i’m so afraid now, what would happen if i somehow managed to commit the actual deed ?” he thought inadvertently as he climbed up to the fourth floor. some ex-military porters blocked his way as they carried some furniture out of one apartment. he already knew that a german, a civil servant, had been living there with his family: “it must be that the german’s moving out now and, consequently, on the fourth floor, on this staircase, on this landing only the old woman’s apartment will be occupied for a certain time. that’s good . . . just in case,” he thought again and rang the old woman’s bell. the bell jingled feebly, as if it were made of tin and not copper. such bells could be found in almost all similar small buildings. he’d already forgotten the ring of this bell, and now this particular sound suddenly seemed to remind him of something and summon it clearly into mind. . . . he even shuddered, since his nerves had been so frayed of late. a few moments later, the door opened a tiny crack: the inhabitant peered out at the caller with visible distrust, and all that could be seen in the darkness were her flashing beady eyes. but, seeing so many people on the landing, she felt emboldened and opened the door wide. the young man stepped across the threshold into a dark vestibule divided by a partition from a tiny kitchen. the old woman stood before him silently, regarding him inquisitively. she was a small, dried-up miserable old woman, about sixty years old, with piercing, malicious little eyes, a small sharp nose, and her bare head. her light blond, slightly grayed hair was thickly smeared with grease. around her long, thin neck, resembling a chicken leg, was draped some sort of flannel rag, and over her shoulders, in spite of the heat, a worn-out, faded fur-trimmed jacket hung loosely. the old woman kept coughing and wheezing. it must have been that the young man glanced at her with some special sort of look, because her former distrust suddenly flashed in her eyes again. “raskolnikov, a student. i was here about a month ago,” the young man hastened to mumble with a slight bow, recalling that he should be more courteous. “i remember, dearie, i remember very well that you were here,” the old woman replied distinctly, as before not taking her inquisitive eyes from his face. “so, ma’am, here i am again about the same sort of thing,” raskolnikov continued, a little flustered and surprised by the old woman’s distrust. “but maybe she’s always like this, and i just didn’t notice it last time,” he thought with an unpleasant feeling. the old woman was silent, as if lost in thought; then she stepped to one side and, pointing at the door into her room, she said, allowing him to pass: “go in, dearie.” the small room, into which the young man stepped, with its yellow wallpaper, geraniums, and muslin curtains on the windows, was at that moment brightly illuminated by the setting sun. “ then, of course, the sun will be shining the same way!” flashed through raskolnikov’s mind, and he cast a swift glance at everything in the room to take it all in and remember its arrangement. but there was nothing special in there. the furniture, all very old and made of yellow"
dostoevsky,"wood, consisted of a sofa with an enormous carved wooden back, an oval table in front of it, a dressing table with a pier mirror standing between the windows, chairs along the walls, and two or three cheap pictures in yellow frames depicting young german ladies with birds in their hands—that’s all the furniture there was. a lamp was burning in the corner in front of a small icon. everything in the room was very clean: the furniture and floors had been polished to a high gloss; everything gleamed. “lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. it was impossible to find even one speck of dust in the whole place. “this is the kind of cleanliness that can be found in the apartments of wicked old widows,” raskolnikov thought to himself, and with curiosity he cast a sidelong glance at the cotton curtain hanging in front of the door into a second little room, which contained the old woman’s bed and dresser, and into which he’d never looked. the whole apartment consisted of these two rooms. “what do you want?” the old woman asked sternly as she entered the room; as before, she stopped in front of him so she could peer directly into his face. “i’ve brought something to pawn—here, ma’am!” he took from his pocket an old flat silver watch. there was a globe depicted on the back of the case. the chain was made of steel. “time’s up for the last pledge you brought. the month ended two days ago.” “i’ll pay you the interest for another month; have patience.” “it’s up to me, dearie, whether i have patience or decide to sell your item now.” “how much for this watch, alyona ivanovna?” “you come here with rubbish, dearie; it’s worth almost nothing. last time i gave you two rubles for that ring, but you can buy a new one at the jeweler’s for a ruble and a half.” “give me four rubles. i’ll redeem it; it was my father’s. i’ll be getting some money soon.” “one ruble and a half, sir, with interest in advance, if you want it.” “a ruble and a half!” cried the young man. “as you wish.” and the old woman handed him back the watch. the young man took it and was so angry that he was just about to leave; but then he reconsidered, remembering that he had nowhere else to go, and that he’d come for a different reason. “all right!” he said rudely. the old woman dug into her pocket for her keys and went into the other room behind the curtain. the young man, left alone in the middle of the room, listened carefully and tried to imagine what she was doing. he could hear her unlocking the dresser. “it must be the topmost drawer,” he thought. “she must carry her keys in her right pocket. . . . all of them as one bunch, on a steel ring. . . . and there’s one key that’s bigger than all the others, three times bigger, with a notched tip; it’s not for the dresser, of course. . . . therefore, there must be some kind of box or chest. . . . that’s odd. all chests have that kind of key. . . . but this is all so vulgar . . .” the old woman came back. “here you are, dearie: if i take ten kopecks per ruble * per month, that comes to fifteen kopecks for one and half rubles for the month ahead. so, at the same rate for the last two rubles, you still owe me twenty kopecks in advance. in all, then, it comes to thirty-five kopecks. so now, in exchange for the watch, you get one ruble, fifteen kopecks. here, take it.” “what? only one ruble and fifteen kopecks now?” “exactly.” the young man didn’t argue and took the money. he looked at the old woman and was in no rush to leave, just as if he wanted to say or do something else, but it seemed as if he himself didn’t know precisely what . . . “in a few days, alyona ivanovna, perhaps i’ll bring you something else . . . a fine . . . little . . . silver . . . cigarette case. . . . as soon as i get it back from a friend . . .” he became flustered and fell silent. “well, dearie, we’ll talk about it then.” “good-bye. . . . are you always home alone? your sister’s never here?” he inquired as casually as possible, passing though the hall. “what business do you have with her, dearie?” “nothing special. i merely asked. and now you’re. . . . good-bye, alyona ivanovna.” raskolnikov left in an absolute confusion that kept growing more and more intense. as he went down the staircase, he even paused several times, as if suddenly struck by something. finally, now out on the street, he exclaimed: “oh, god! how repulsive this all is! can i really, really . . . no, it’s rubbish, absurdity!” he added conclusively. “how could such a horrible thing enter my mind? yet my heart seems capable of such filth! the main thing is: it’s filthy, foul, vile, vile! yet for the last month i’ve been . . .” but he couldn’t express his agitation, either in words or exclamations. the feeling of infinite revulsion that had begun to oppress and torment his heart as he’d been coming to see the old woman had now reached such proportions and was so palpable that he didn’t know where to hide from his anguish. he walked along the sidewalk like a drunk, without noticing the passersby, and bumping into them; he came to his senses only at the next street. after looking around, he saw that he was standing next to a tavern, the entrance to which was down a staircase leading from the street level, into the cellar. just at that moment, two drunks emerged"
dostoevsky,"from the door, supporting each other and cursing, and climbed up to the street. without much thought, raskolnikov went right down the stairs. he’d never frequented taverns before, but now his head was spinning; besides, he was suffering from a burning thirst. he felt like drinking a cold beer, all the more so since he attributed his sudden weakness to the fact that he was hungry. he sat down at a sticky table in a dark, dirty corner, ordered a beer, and gulped down the first glass. everything receded immediately, and his thoughts became clear. “it’s all rubbish,” he said hopefully. “there’s no reason to get so distraught! it was merely physical upset! one glass of beer, a piece of rusk, † and then, in a minute, my mind grows strong, my thoughts grow clear, and my intentions are reinforced! ugh, what nonsense it all is!” in spite of this contemptuous disdain, he seemed cheerful already, as if suddenly liberated from some terrible burden, and he cast his eyes amicably over those present. but even at that moment he had a distant premonition that all his assurance of better times was also morbid. not many people were left in the tavern at that time. besides those two drunks he met on the staircase, a whole group left right after them, about five men with an accordion and a young girl. afterward it became quiet and spacious. there sat: one fellow who looked like a tradesman, drunk, but not too, nursing his beer; his large, fat pal, wearing a short jacket, sporting a gray beard, very intoxicated, dozing on the bench; from time to time this fellow would suddenly, as if half asleep, start snapping his fingers, fling his arms out wide, and jerk the top half of his body around without getting up from the bench, meanwhile warbling some nonsense as he tried to recall a few lines, something like: i loved my wife for one whole year, for one who-ole year i lov-ved my wi-fe . . . or, suddenly rousing himself, he would begin again: as i walked along podyachesky lane, i found my former wife . . . but no one shared his merriment; his taciturn companion even regarded all these outbursts with hostility and distrust. there was one other man there; from his looks he might have been a former civil servant. he sat apart with his glass of vodka, occasionally taking a drink and glancing around. he was also in a state of some agitation. * one ruble was equivalent to kopecks. † a hard, dry biscuit. oceanofpdf.com ii r askolnikov was not accustomed to the crowd, and as has already been said, he’d been avoiding any social contact, especially of late. but now, for some reason, he was suddenly drawn to people. something was happening within him, something new, and at the same time he felt a kind of yearning for people. he was so exhausted from his whole month of concentrated melancholy and gloomy agitation that he felt like taking a breath in another world, wherever it was, and in spite of the filth of his surroundings, he now remained in the tavern with pleasure. the owner of the establishment was in another room but frequently entered the main room, coming down the stairs from somewhere above, indicated first by the appearance of his fashionable shiny boots, with their large red tops. he was wearing a light coat and a terribly stained black satin vest without a tie, and his entire face seemed smeared with oil as if it were an iron lock. behind the bar stood a lad about fourteen years old, and there was another, younger boy who served food if anyone ordered something. there were sliced pickles, black rusks, and pieces of fish; it all smelled very bad. it was so stuffy that it was even unbearable to sit there; everything was so saturated by the smell of alcohol that it seemed a person could become drunk in about five minutes just inhaling the air. sometimes meetings occur, even with completely unfamiliar people in whom we begin to take an interest right from the first glance, somehow suddenly, unexpectedly, before one word is spoken. that was precisely the impression made on raskolnikov by the patron who was sitting alone and who looked like a former civil servant. several times afterward the young man recalled this first impression and even ascribed it to a premonition. raskolnikov kept glancing over at the man, particularly, of course, because the man was staring persistently at him; it was obvious that the man very much wanted to strike up a conversation. the civil servant regarded the others in the tavern, even the owner, as somehow ordinary; he was even bored by them; at the same time, he felt a trace of haughty scorn, as if they were people of a lower order or a lower cultural level, to whom there was nothing to say. he was a man already past fifty, of average height and solid build, with graying hair and a large bald spot, a yellow, even greenish face swollen by constant drunkenness, puffy eyelids under which shone, like little slits, tiny but animated small reddish eyes. but there was something about him that was very strange, even some kind of enthusiasm glowing in his eyes—perhaps also meaning and intelligence—and at the same time there also seemed to be a trace of madness. he was dressed in an old, completely worn-out tailcoat, missing most of its buttons. only one was still holding on somehow, but that was how he fastened it, apparently hoping to maintain some shred of dignity. his shirtfront protruded from under his heavy cotton vest, all wrinkled, soiled, and stained. his face had been shaved, like a civil servant’s, but a long time ago, and his gray whiskers had already begun to grow back densely. there was indeed in his bearing something to suggest a solid civil servant. but he was"
dostoevsky,"anxious, raked his fingers through his hair, and sometimes supported his head with both hands, resting his elbows, in their frayed sleeves, on the soiled, sticky table. at last he looked directly at raskolnikov and said, in a loud, firm voice: “do i dare, my kind sir, address you with a decent question? even though you don’t appear to be a person of consequence, my experience tells me that you’re an educated man and not accustomed to drink. i myself have always respected education combined with heartfelt feelings, and in addition, i’m a titular counselor. * marmeladov—that’s my name; a titular counselor. dare i ask if you’re also a civil servant?” “no, i’m a student,” the young man replied, in part surprised by the man’s particularly ornate speech, and by the fact that he’d been addressed so directly, so point-blank. in spite of his recent momentary desire to seek some connection with other people, at these first words directed at him he suddenly sensed his usually unpleasant and irritating feeling of revulsion toward any unknown person who intruded upon or merely wanted to impose upon his person. “a student, naturally, or former student!” the civil servant cried. “just as i thought! experience, my dear sir, repeated experience!” and, as a sign of boasting, he pointed a finger at his own forehead. “you were a student or you’ve studied at the university! allow me . . .” he stood, nodded, grabbed his carafe, his glass, and sat down next to the young man, at a slight angle away. he was drunk, but spoke volubly and boldly, losing track only occasionally and dragging out his words. he fell upon raskolnikov even with some voraciousness, as if he also hadn’t spoken with anyone for a whole month. “kind sir,” he began almost solemnly, “poverty is no vice; that’s a known truth. i know even more so that drunkenness is not a virtue. but destitution, dear sir, destitution—that is a vice. in poverty you can still preserve the nobility of your innate feelings, while in destitution you never do and no one does. for destitution you’re not even driven away with a stick—you’re swept out of human company with a broom so that it will be even more humiliating; and that’s fair, for in my destitution i’m the first one prepared to humiliate myself. hence, the tavern! dear sir, a month ago a certain mr. lebezyatnikov gave my wife a beating; but my wife is not like me! you understand, sir? allow me to inquire further, just so, even out of mere curiosity: have you ever spent a night sleeping on a hay barge on the neva?” “no, i haven’t,” replied raskolnikov. “why do you ask?” “well, sir, that’s where i’m coming from; it’s already my fifth night . . .” he filled his glass, drank it down, and fell to musing. and it was true that here and there some small strands of hay were sticking to his clothes and even to his hair. it was very likely that he hadn’t washed or changed his clothes in those five days. his hands were especially grimy, greasy, and reddish, and his fingernails were black. his conversation seemed to arouse general, though listless attention. the boys behind the counter started giggling. the tavern keeper, it seemed, purposely came down from the upper room to hear this “amusing fellow,” and sat a ways off, yawning lazily but ostentatiously. obviously, marmeladov had been known here for a long time. he had probably acquired this proclivity for ornate speech as a result of frequent conversations in taverns with various strangers. in some drunkards this habit becomes a necessity, primarily among those who receive harsh treatment at home and who are ordered about. that’s why in drunken company they always seem to crave justification, and if possible, even respect. “what an amusing fellow!” the tavern keeper said loudly. “how come you don’t work, huh, if you’re a civil servant? why don’t you serve?” “why don’t i serve, my dear sir?” marmeladov seized on the question, turning exclusively to raskolnikov as if he’d posed it. “why don’t i serve? don’t you think my heart aches over the fact that i grovel to no avail? when, one month ago, mr. lebezyatnikov beat my wife with his own hands, as i lay there drunk, don’t you think i suffered? allow me to ask you, young man, has it ever happened that you had to . . . hmm . . . beg for a loan of money without hope?” “it has . . . but what do you mean without hope?” “i mean completely hopelessly, knowing in advance that nothing will come of it. for example, you know beforehand, absolutely, that this most well-intentioned and most useful citizen won’t give you money under any circumstances because why, i ask, why should he? after all, he knows i won’t pay it back. out of compassion? but mr. lebezyatnikov, who’s a follower of the latest ideas, was explaining to me just the other day that in our era compassion has even been prohibited by science and that this is already being done in england, where they’ve developed political economy. why then, i ask, should he give me anything? yet, knowing beforehand that he won’t, you still set off on your way and . . .” “why do you set off?” added raskolnikov. “what if there’s no one else to see, nowhere else to go? everyone has to have somewhere to go. because there comes a time when it’s absolutely essential to go somewhere. when my only daughter went out for the first time with a streetwalker’s yellow ticket, † then i went out, too. (my daughter makes her living by streetwalking, sir . . .),” he added in parentheses, regarding the young man with some anxiety. “never mind, my dear sir, never mind!” he hastened to declare immediately, even with apparent calm, when the two lads standing at the bar chuckled and the tavern"
dostoevsky,"keeper smiled. “never mind, sir! i don’t take offense at their heads nodding, because everyone knows everything already; nothing’s secret, that shall not be made manifest; i regard all this not with contempt, but with humility. let it go! let it! ‘behold the man!’ ‡ allow me, young man, can you. . . . but no, it should be explained more powerfully and imaginatively: looking at me at this very moment, it’s not a matter of can you, rather it’s dare you state positively that i am not a swine?” the young man uttered not one word in reply. “well, sir,” the speaker continued steadfastly, even with a reinforced sense of self-respect, having paused to let another outburst of laughter in the room die down. “well, sir, i may be a swine, but she is a lady! i am made in the image of a beast, but my wife, katerina ivanovna, is an educated person, born the daughter of a field officer. i may be a scoundrel, but she’s been raised with a noble heart and brought up with magnanimous feelings. meanwhile . . . oh, if only she pitied me! my dear, dear sir, every man needs to have at least one place where he’s pitied! and while katerina ivanovna is a generous woman, she’s unjust. . . . while i myself understand that when she pulls tufts of my hair, she’s doing so from a feeling of pity in her heart (for, i repeat without embarrassment, she does pull tufts of my hair, young man),” he confirmed in a dignified tone after hearing laughter once again, “but, my god, what if even once she. . . . but no! no! it’s all in vain, and there’s nothing more to be said! nothing at all! for more than once have i got what i wanted, more than once have i been pitied, but . . . but such is my nature, i’m a born beast!” “that’s for sure!” observed the tavern keeper, with a yawn. marmeladov resolutely banged his fist on the table. “such is my nature! do you know, sir, do you know, that i even pawned her stockings? not her shoes, sir, since that would have resembled the normal course of events, but her stockings, i pawned her stockings, sir! i also hocked her mohair shawl, a gift, an earlier one, her own, not from me. we live in a chilly corner, and this past winter she caught a cold and began coughing, even spitting up blood. we have three small children, and katerina ivanovna works from morning to night, scrubbing and washing and bathing the children, since she’s used to cleanliness from early childhood, but she has a weak chest and is predisposed to consumption—that i feel. how can i not feel it? and the more i drink, the more i feel it. that’s why i drink, because i’m seeking compassion and feeling in this drinking. . . . it’s not joy i seek, only sorrow. . . . i drink because i genuinely want to suffer!” and then, as if in despair, he rested his head on the table. “young man,” he continued, raising his head again, “i can read some sorrow in your face. i saw it when you entered, and that’s why i turned to you right away. in telling you the story of my life, i don’t wish to parade my disgrace before these idlers here, who know it all already; i’m seeking a sensitive, educated man. do you know that my wife was educated in a provincial school for children of the nobility, and at the award ceremony she was chosen to perform the shawl dance § in the presence of the governor and other distinguished guests, for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of merit? a medal . . . well, we sold that medal . . . a long time ago . . . hmm . . . the certificate’s still in her trunk, and she recently showed it to our landlady. even though she has endless quarrels with the landlady, she wanted to show off to someone and tell her about those happy days in the past. i don’t condemn her, i don’t, because these things are preserved in her memory, and all the rest has turned to dust! yes, yes; she’s a hot-tempered woman, proud and obstinate. she washes the floor herself and has only black bread to eat, but she won’t tolerate any disrespect. that’s why she wouldn’t tolerate mr. lebezyatnikov’s rudeness, and when he gave her a beating, she took to her bed more as a result of her feeling than from the actual blows. she was already a widow when i married her, with three children, each smaller than the other. her first husband was a cavalry officer, and she married him for love and ran away from her parents’ house with him. she loved her husband dearly, but he took to gambling, ended up in court, and soon died. he’d begun beating her toward the end; although she didn’t let him get away with it, about which i have detailed documentary evidence; she weeps to this day when she remembers him and reproaches me. i’m glad, very glad that even in her imagination she can see herself as being happy for a while. . . . after his death she was left with three young children in a distant and dreadful provincial town, where i was also staying at the time; she was living in such hopeless poverty—even though i’ve had many different experiences, i can’t even begin to describe her situation. her family refused to help her. besides, she was proud, extremely proud. . . . and then, my dear sir, then, being a widower myself, and having a fourteen-year-old daughter, i proposed to her because i couldn’t bear to see such suffering. you can judge for yourself the degree of her misfortune, that she, an educated and well-brought-up"
dostoevsky,"woman from an eminent family, agreed to marry the likes of me! but she did! weeping and wailing, wringing her hands, she did! because she had nowhere else to go. do you understand, do you really understand, dear sir, what it means when a person has nowhere else to go? no! you don’t understand it yet. . . . for one whole year i fulfilled my obligation devotedly and devoutly and never touched the bottle”—he pointed to the bottle—“because i do have feelings. but even then i couldn’t please her, even with that; it was afterward, when i lost my job, which wasn’t my fault, but it happened because of changes in the department that i turned to drink! it’s already been about half a year, after our wanderings and numerous misfortunes, since we finally turned up in this splendid capital with all of its many monuments. and i found a job here. . . . i found one and then i lost it. do you understand, sir? this time it was my own fault, because i had reached the end of my rope. . . . now we live in a little corner, at our landlady’s, amaliya fedorovna lippevekhsel, but i don’t know how we manage to live and pay her. many others live there besides us. . . . it’s sodom, sir, of the most hideous kind . . . hmm . . . yes. . . . meanwhile my daughter from my first marriage has grown up; i won’t describe what she had to suffer while growing up, my daughter, from her stepmother. because although katerina ivanovna is filled with kindly feelings, she’s a hot-tempered and irritable lady, and she can snap. . . . yes, sir! there’s no reason to recall it! as you can well imagine, sonya received no education. about four years ago, i tried to read some geography and world history with her; but since i myself was weak in those areas and we had no suitable textbooks, and the books we did have . . . hmm . . . well, we don’t even have those books now, all our reading ended then and there. we stopped at the persian king cyrus the great. ¶ then, once she was older, she read some books of romantic content as well as several others, given to her by mr. lebezyatnikov. one was lewes’s physiology . # do you happen to know it, sir? she read it with great interest and even read some passages aloud to us: and that was her entire education. now i’m turning to you, my dear sir, on my own behalf, with a confidential question of my own: in your opinion, can a poor but honest girl earn a living by honest work? she can’t earn even fifteen kopecks a day, sir, if she’s honest, since she possesses no special skills, and that’s even if she works all the time! besides, the state councillor ivan ivanovich klopshtok—have you ever heard of him? not only hasn’t he paid her yet for the half dozen fine cotton shirts she made him, but he even drove her out with insults, stamping his feet and calling her names, claiming that the collars were the wrong size and had been sewn in crooked. meanwhile the children go hungry. . . . and then katerina ivanovna, wringing her hands, paces the room, her face flushed with the red blotches that always accompany that illness: ‘you live here with us,’ she says, ‘like a sponger; you eat and drink and enjoy the warmth, but what’s there to eat and drink when these little ones haven’t seen a crust of bread for three days?’ i was lying there at the time . . . why not say it? i was a little drunk, sir, and i heard my sonya (she’s very meek and has such a soft voice . . . she’s fair-haired and her face is always so pale and thin), say: ‘oh, katerina ivanovna, must i really go out and do that?’ meanwhile, darya frantsevna, a malevolent woman well known to the police, had reported her to the landlady several times. ‘so what?’ replied katerina ivanovna, with a mocking laugh, ‘what are you saving yourself for? what a treasure!’ but don’t blame her, don’t, dear sir, don’t blame her! she wasn’t in her right mind when she said it; she was agitated, sick, and the children were crying because they hadn’t eaten, and she said it more as an insult than as what she really meant. . . . because katerina ivanovna is the sort of person who, as soon as the children begin crying, even when they’re hungry, begins to beat them right away. and then i saw how sonechka, around six o’clock, got up, put on a kerchief, her hooded cloak, and left the apartment; she came back at nine. she walked in and went straight up to katerina ivanovna and silently put thirty silver rubles down on the table in front of her. she didn’t utter one word as she did, didn’t even look at her, but merely picked up our large green shawl (we have one that we use), covered her head and face completely, and lay down on the bed, facing the wall, but her whole body and her little shoulders were trembling. . . . meanwhile, sir, i lay there, in the same condition as before. . . . and then i saw, young man, i saw how katerina ivanovna, also without saying a word, went up to sonechka’s bed and knelt there all evening, kissing her feet; she was unable to stand, and then, embracing, they both fell asleep together . . . both of them . . . both of them . . . yes, sir . . . while i . . . i lay there drunk, sir.” marmeladov fell silent, as if his voice had broken off. then he suddenly filled his glass, drank it down"
dostoevsky,"quickly, and grunted. “since then, sir,” he continued after a brief pause, “since then, as a result of one unfortunate incident and the fact that some ill-intentioned people informed the authorities, which darya frantsevna had encouraged because she felt as if she hadn’t been treated with appropriate respect, since then my daughter, sofiya semyonovna, was compelled to obtain the yellow card of a prostitute, and as a result has no longer been able to reside with us. it was the landlady, amaliya fedorovna, who wouldn’t allow it (darya frantsevna had previously encouraged her in this), as well as mr. lebezyatnikov . . . hmm. . . . that entire episode with katerina ivanovna occurred because of sonya. at first he himself tried to have his way with her, and then he suddenly became very touchy: ‘how can i, such a cultured person,’ he says, ‘continue to live in the same apartment with a person like her?’ katerina ivanovna wouldn’t tolerate it and got involved . . . and thus the incident occurred. . . . and now sonechka stops by mostly after dark, comforts katerina ivanovna, and leaves whatever money she can. . . . she lives in the apartment of the tailor kapernaumov, renting a room from them; he’s lame and afflicted with a speech defect and his entire large family has the same defect. his wife has it, too. . . . they all live together in one room; sonya has her own room, with a partition. . . . hmm, yes. . . . these people are very poor and all afflicted with this speech defect . . . yes. . . . one morning i’d just woken up, sir, put on my ragged clothes, raised my hands to heaven, and set off to see his excellency, ivan afanasevich. do you happen to know his excellency, ivan afanasevich? no? then you don’t know such a virtuous man! he’s like wax . . . wax before the face of the lord; he melts like wax! after hearing me out, he even grew tearful. ‘well, marmeladov,’ he says, ‘you’ve disappointed my expectations once before. . . . i’ll take you on again as my own responsibility,’ that’s what he said. ‘remember this,’ he said, ‘and now go away!’ i kissed the dust at his feet, mentally, because he wouldn’t have allowed it, being a person of such high rank and modern ideas about public service; i returned home, and when i announced that i’d been reinstated in my job and would be receiving a salary, lord, what a commotion it caused!” marmeladov paused again, overcome with strong emotion. just then a whole group of men entered from outside, already quite drunk, with the sound of a rented accordion and the soft, cracked voice of a seven-year-old child singing “the little farm.” it grew loud. the tavern keeper and the waiters attended to the new arrivals. marmeladov, who didn’t pay any attention to these people, continued his story. he already seemed very weak, but the more intoxicated he grew, the more talkative he became. his recollections of his recent successes at work seemed to invigorate him, and some were even reflected in his face by a sort of radiance. raskolnikov listened attentively. “this took place, good sir, about five weeks ago. yes. . . . they’d both just found out, katerina ivanovna and sonechka, good lord, and it was as if i’d been admitted to the heavenly kingdom. it used to be that i’d lie around like a beast, and receive only abuse! but that day: they walked around on tiptoe and kept the children quiet: ‘semyon zakharych is tired from his work; he’s resting: shh!’ they’d serve me coffee before i went off to work, and they’d even heat up some cream! they began to buy real cream, do you hear? i have no idea how they scraped the money together to provide me with a decent uniform, eleven rubles and fifty kopecks. boots, the finest calico shirtfronts, and a uniform: they threw it all together splendidly for eleven and a half rubles. the first day, i arrived home from work in the morning and saw that katerina ivanovna had prepared two courses, soup and salted beef with horseradish, something we’d never even dreamt of before. she doesn’t own a dress . . . that is, none at all, sir, and now she looked as if she were going out visiting; she was all dressed up; it wasn’t as if she had anything to use, she did it all from nothing; her hair was done up, she had a clean white collar and sleeve covers; she looked like a completely different person, much younger and prettier. sonechka, my little sweetheart, had merely provided the money, while for the time being, she said, she thought it wouldn’t be proper for her to visit us too often, except after dark, so no one would see her. you hear, do you hear? i came home after dinner to have a little rest, and what do you think? katerina ivanovna simply couldn’t resist: a week before she’d had a really terrible quarrel with the landlady, amaliya fedorovna, and now she’d invited her to come for a cup of coffee. they sat there for two hours whispering all the time: ‘now,’ katerina says, ‘since semyon zakharych is back at work and receiving a salary, and he’s even been to see his excellency; his excellency came out himself, told everyone else to wait, while he took semyon zakharych by the arm and escorted him into his office. you hear, do you hear? “of course,” he says to him, “i remember your service, semyon zakharych, and although you displayed a fondness for that trivial frailty, now, since you’ve made a promise, and besides, without you things had started to go badly.” (you hear, do you hear?) “i hope,” he says, “now on your word of honor,”—that is, all of it, i tell you, she made up"
dostoevsky,"the whole story, not as a result of thoughtlessness, sir, but so she could boast a bit! no, sir, she herself believed the whole thing; she was consoling herself using her own imagination, so help me god! i don’t condemn her; no, i don’t condemn her for this at all! when, six days later, i brought my first wages home—twenty-three rubles and forty kopecks—when i brought it all home, she called me a sweetie: ‘you’re such a sweetie,’ she said! we were all alone, sir, do you understand? well, it’s not for my looks, and besides, what sort of husband am i? no, she pinched my cheek: ‘you’re such a sweetie!’ she said.” marmeladov paused, was about to smile, but suddenly his chin began to quiver, though he restrained himself. this tavern, his debauched appearance, his five nights on a hay barge, his bottle, and, at the same time, this painful love for his wife and family disconcerted his listener. raskolnikov attended intensely, but with painful emotion. he was annoyed with himself that he’d dropped into the tavern. “dear sir, dear sir!” marmeladov exclaimed after recovering. “oh, sir, you may find all this amusing, as do the others, since i’m only upsetting you with the foolishness of all these petty details of my domestic life, but i don’t find it amusing in the least! that’s because i can feel it all. . . . i spent the rest of that entire heavenly day of my life and all that evening in fleeting dreams: that is, how i’d arrange everything, outfit the children, provide peace of mind to my wife, and return my only begotten daughter to the bosom of the family from her disgrace. . . . and more, much more. . . . it’s permitted, sir. well, sir, my good sir”—marmeladov suddenly seemed to shudder, raise his head, and stare at his listener—“well, sir, the next day, after all these daydreams, that is, exactly five days ago, toward evening, by clever stealth, like a thief in the night, i stole the key from katerina ivanovna’s box, took out what was left of the money i’d brought home, i don’t recall how much it was, and now, look at me, all of you! i’ve been away from home five days; they’re looking for me, it’s the end of my job, and my uniform is left in some tavern near the egyptian bridge; i traded it for these clothes . . . and it’s the end of everything!” marmeladov struck his fist on his forehead, clenched his teeth, closed his eyes, and placed his elbow firmly on the table. but in a moment his face suddenly changed; he glanced at raskolnikov with some sort of assumed cunning and feigned insolence, started laughing, and said: “i visited sonya today. i went to ask her for some money to buy a drink so i could get rid of my hangover! tee-hee!” “did she really give you any?” someone who’d just come in cried, then burst out laughing. “this bottle was bought with her money, sir,” marmeladov uttered, addressing raskolnikov exclusively. “she gave me thirty kopecks, with her own hands, her last coins, all there was, i could see for myself. . . . she didn’t say a word, merely looked at me in silence. . . . that doesn’t happen here on earth, but up there . . . they grieve over people, they weep, but they do not reproach them, they don’t! but that hurts more, sir, much more, sir, when they don’t reproach them! thirty kopecks, yes, sir. but she needs them herself now, doesn’t she? what do you think, my dear sir? now she has to keep herself clean. this extra cleanliness costs money, do you understand? do you? well, she also has to buy makeup, doesn’t she? starched petticoats, the kind of stylish shoes that display her little feet when she has to step over a puddle. do you understand, do you, sir, what this cleanliness means? well, sir, i, her own father, took those thirty kopecks to ease my hangover! and i’m drinking, sir! i’ve already spent it all on drink, sir! well, who would feel sorry for the likes of me? eh? do you feel sorry for me now, sir, or not? tell me, sir, do you feel sorry or not? ha, ha, ha!” he wanted to refill his glass, but there was nothing left. the bottle was empty. “why should anyone feel sorry for you?” demanded the tavern keeper, who’d turned up next to them once again. there was a burst of laughter and even some cursing. the listeners laughed and cursed, and even those who weren’t listening joined in, simply looking at the sorry sight of the former civil servant. “sorry? why feel sorry for me?” marmeladov cried suddenly, standing up, his arm outstretched, now genuinely inspired, as if he’d been waiting for those words. “why feel sorry? you ask. no, there’s no reason to feel sorry for me! i should be crucified, nailed to a cross, not pitied. but crucify me, oh judge, crucify me, and after having crucified me, then feel sorry for me! i myself will come and ask to be crucified, for it’s not joy i seek, but sorrow and tears! do you think, oh, shopkeeper, that your bottle has afforded me any pleasure? sorrow, sorrow is what i sought in its depths, sorrow and tears, and i found them and tasted of them; but he who has pitied all men and who has understood everyone and everything, he will take pity on us; he and no one else; he is the judge. he will come on that day and he will ask: ‘where is thy daughter who sacrificed herself for her wicked and consumptive stepmother and for a stranger’s little children? where is thy daughter who pitied her earthly father, a useless drunkard, and who was not dismayed by his beastliness?’ and he will say: ‘come forth! i have already"
dostoevsky,"forgiven thee. . . . i have forgiven thee once. . . . thy many sins are now also forgiven, for thou hast loved much. . . .’ and he will forgive my sonya, he will; i know that he will forgive her. . . . just a little while ago when i was with her, i felt this in my heart! and he will judge and forgive everyone, both the good and the evil, the wise men and the humble. . . . and when he has finished with everyone, then he will summon us, too: ‘come forth,’ he will say, ‘even ye! come forth, ye drunkards, come forth, ye weaklings, come forth, ye shameless ones!’ and we will all come forth, without shame, and we will stand before him. and he will say, ‘ye are swine! ye are made in the image of the beast and ye bear his mark; but ye also shall come forth!’ and the wise men and the learned men will exclaim, ‘lord! wherefore do you receive these people?’ and he will say, ‘i receive them, oh, ye wise men, i receive them, oh, ye learned men, because not one of them hath ever considered himself worthy. . . .’ and he will stretch forth his arms to us, and we will kiss his hands . . . and we will weep . . . and we will understand all things! then will we understand all things! and everyone will understand . . . even katerina ivanovna . . . she, too, will understand. . . . oh, lord, thy kingdom come!” deep in thought, he sank down on the bench, weak and exhausted, looking at no one, oblivious of his surroundings. his words made quite an impression; silence reigned for a moment, but soon the previous laughter and curses resumed. “know-it-all!” “damned liar!” “bureaucrat!” and so on and so forth. “let’s go, sir,” marmeladov said suddenly, raising his head and turning to raskolnikov. “take me home . . . to kozel’s house, in the courtyard. it’s time . . . to katerina ivanovna . . .” raskolnikov had been wanting to leave for some time; he himself had even thought about helping the other man get home. marme­ladov’s legs were much weaker than his words, and he leaned heavily on the young man. they had only about two or three hundred paces to walk. the closer they got to his house, the more and more the drunken man was overcome by embarrassment and fear. “i’m not afraid of katerina ivanovna now,” he muttered in agitation. “it’s not that she’ll begin tearing out my hair. what do i care about my hair? it’s nothing! that’s what i say! it’ll even be better if she begins tearing it out! that’s not what i’m afraid of. . . . i’m . . . afraid of her eyes . . . yes . . . her eyes. . . . i’m also afraid of the red blotches on her cheeks . . . and then—i’m afraid of her breathing. . . . have you ever heard how people with this illness breathe . . . when they’re distraught? i’m also afraid of the children’s crying. . . . because if sonya hasn’t fed them, then . . . i don’t know what! i just don’t! but i’m not afraid of a beating. you should know, sir, not only are such beatings not painful, i even enjoy them. . . . for i myself couldn’t do without them. it’s better that way. let her beat me; it relieves her soul. . . . it’s better that way. . . . here’s the house. kozel’s house. he’s a locksmith, a german, he’s rich . . . lead on.” they entered from the courtyard and went up to the fourth floor. the farther they climbed, the darker the stairs became. it was almost eleven o’clock, and even though at that time of year there’s no real night in petersburg, it was very dark at the top of the stairs. the small sooty door at the end of the stairway, at the very top, was open. a candle stub lit the poorest of rooms, only ten paces long; it was entirely visible from the hallway. everything was thrown about and in disarray, especially the children’s clothing. a bedsheet with holes in it had been hung across the back corner. behind it, most likely, stood a bed. there were only two chairs in the room itself and a very tattered oilcloth sofa, in front of which stood an old kitchen table made of pine, unpainted and uncovered. at the edge of the table was a partially burned tallow candle stub in an iron candlestick. it turned out that marmeladov lived in a separate room, not in that corner; his room was one through which people had to pass. the door to the farthest rooms or cells, into which amaliya lippevekhsel’s apartment had been divided, stood slightly ajar. there was a great deal of noise and shouting. there was loud laughter. it seemed that people were playing cards and having tea. sometimes the most indecorous words emerged. raskolnikov recognized katerina ivanovna immediately. she was a terribly emaciated woman, thin, rather tall and elegant, with lovely dark brown hair still, and real red blotches on her cheeks. she paced back and forth in her little room, arms folded across her chest, lips parched, gasping unevenly for breath. her eyes were shining as if she had a fever, but her glance was sharp and steady, and her consumptive and agitated face made a morbid impression in the last light of the flickering candle end quivering on her face. she seemed to raskolnikov to be about thirty years old and was certainly no match for marmeladov. . . . she didn’t hear and didn’t see the men entering; she seemed to be in some sort of stupor in which she neither saw nor heard anything. it"
dostoevsky,"was stuffy in the room, but she hadn’t opened the window; there was a stench emanating from the staircase, but the door stood open; waves of tobacco smoke wafted in from the inner rooms through the open door; she was coughing but hadn’t closed the door. the youngest girl, around six years old, was asleep on the floor, sitting up somehow, hunched over, her head resting on the sofa. the little boy, a year older than her, was trembling in the corner and crying. he’d probably just been beaten. the eldest daughter, around nine years old, was as tall and slim as a matchstick, wearing only a wretched, very tattered blouse, and draped over her bare shoulders a decrepit cotton shawl that had probably been made for her about two years ago, because now it didn’t even reach her knees; she stood in the corner next to her younger brother, embracing his neck with one long arm, desiccated as a matchstick. she seemed to be comforting him, whispering something to him, doing all she could so he wouldn’t start whimpering again, while at the same time she followed her mother with her very, very large dark eyes, which seemed even larger on her emaciated and frightened little face. marmeladov, before entering the room, sank to his knees in the doorway, while he pushed raskolnikov forward. the woman, noticing a stranger, paused distractedly in front of him; having returned to her senses momentarily, she seemed to be wondering why he’d come in. but most likely she imagined that he was heading into the other rooms, since theirs served as the passageway. realizing this and not paying any more attention, she went to the hall door to close it; then, catching sight of her husband kneeling on the threshold, she suddenly screamed. “ah!” she cried in a rage. “so you’ve come back! you crook! you monster! where’s the money? what’s left in your pocket? show me! and your clothes? where are your clothes? where’s the money? tell me . . .” she rushed at him to begin searching. marmeladov obediently and calmly raised both his arms to the sides to make it easier to search his pockets. there wasn’t a kopeck left. “where’s the money?” she screamed. “oh, lord, did he really spend it all on drink? there were twelve silver rubles left in the box!” suddenly, in a rage, she grabbed hold of his hair and dragged him into the room. marmeladov himself made it easier for her, crawling on his knees meekly behind her. “even this gives me enjoyment! even this isn’t painful, but en-joy-ab-le, my dear-est kind sir,” he cried, being shaken by his hair and even bumping his forehead once on the floor. the child who was asleep on the floor woke up and began crying. the little boy in the corner couldn’t restrain himself, began shaking, burst into tears, and, in a terrible fright, almost a fit, rushed to his sister. the older girl, half awake, trembled like a leaf. “drank it up! all of it, he drank it all up!” the poor woman shouted in despair. “and those aren’t his clothes! they’re hungry, hungry!” (wringing her hands, she pointed to the children.) “oh, what a cursed life! and you, aren’t you ashamed?” she said, turning suddenly on raskolnikov. “from the tavern! were you drinking with him? were you drinking with him, too? get out!” the young man hastened to leave without saying a word. besides, the interior door swung open, and several curious onlookers peeked in. impudent people in skullcaps were stretching their heads forward, laughing and smoking cigarettes or pipes. there were people wearing bathrobes, some left completely unfastened, or wearing almost indecent summer clothes; others held cards in their hands. they laughed especially heartily when marmeladov, being dragged by his hair, cried that he found it enjoyable. they even began coming into the room; at last one could hear a sinister screech: it was amaliya lippevekhsel forcing her way through to impose a sort of order and to frighten the poor woman for the hundredth time with her insulting command to vacate the apartment by the following day. as he left, raskolnikov managed to shove his hand into his pocket, grab the change left from the ruble he’d cashed at the tavern, and place it on the windowsill unobserved. then, once on the staircase, he reconsidered and wanted to return. “what a foolish thing i just did,” he thought. “they have sonya, and i need the money myself.” but after some thought, he realized that it was already impossible to take it back and he wouldn’t do it, anyway; he gave up and returned to his own apartment. “sonya also has to buy makeup,” he went on, grinning sarcastically as he walked along the street. “this cleanliness costs money. . . . hmm. but maybe sonechka won’t make any money today, because there’s always risk involved, hunting for valuable game, prospecting for gold. . . . without my money, they might still have nothing at all tomorrow. . . . ah, that sonya! what a gold mine they’ve discovered! and they mine it! i’ll say they do! and they’ve gotten used to it. they shed a few tears and then they got used to it. man’s a scoundrel: he can get used to anything!” he started musing. “but what if i’m wrong?” he suddenly cried inadvertently. “what if man’s really not a scoundrel, in general—that is, the whole human race; that would mean that all the rest is prejudice, merely imagined fears, and there are no boundaries, and that’s how it should be!” * a fairly low rank in the russian civil service, corresponding to that of a captain in the army. † prostitutes in russia were registered with the police and required to carry yellow identity cards. ‡ pontius pilate’s words in john : when presenting jesus to the crowd. § a dance associated with upper-class young ladies, especially those educated in socially"

you’re wasting away!” the lodger opened his eyes, shuddered, and recognized nastasya. “is that tea from the landlady or what?” he asked, slowly and painfully raising himself up a bit on the sofa. “the landlady! ha!” she placed her own cracked teapot in front of him, with its diluted tea and two yellow lumps of sugar. “here, nastasya, take this, please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (he’d been sleeping in his clothes), and he pulled out a handful of copper coins. “go buy me a roll. and get me a little sausage from the sausage maker, the cheapest sort.” “i’ll bring you a roll in a moment, but wouldn’t you like some cabbage soup instead of sausage? it’s from yesterday and it’s good. i saved you some, but you came home late. it’s good cabbage soup.” when she’d brought in the soup and he’d set about eating it, nastasya sat down on the sofa next to him and started chatting. she was a peasant woman and very talkative. “praskovya pavlovna wants to complain to the police about you,” she said. he winced deeply. “to the police? what does she want?” “you don’t pay her any money and you won’t vacate the room. it’s clear what she wants.” “oh, hell, that’s all i needed,” he muttered, grinding his teeth. “no, that’s not . . . a good thing right now. . . . she’s a fool,” he said aloud. “i’ll go see her today. i’ll talk to her.” “she may be a fool, just like i am, but what about you? are you clever, lying here like a sack, with nothing to show for it? before, you said, you used to teach children; why don’t you do anything now?” “i do . . .” raskolnikov said reluctantly and harshly. “what do you do?” “i work . . .” “what kind of work?” “i think,” he replied seriously after a little pause. nastasya simply collapsed in laughter. she was easily amused, and when she found something funny, she laughed inaudibly, her whole body rocking and shaking until she felt sick. “have you thought up a lot of money?” she was finally able to utter. “without boots, you can’t go teach. besides, i spit on them.” “don’t spit into the well you drink from.” “they pay me almost nothing to teach children. what can you do with kopecks?” he continued reluctantly, as if replying to his own thoughts. “you want all your capital at once?” he regarded her with a strange look. “yes, all my capital,” he replied firmly, after a slight pause. “well, better to go slowly, or you’ll scare me; i’m already very frightened. should i get you a roll, or not?” “as you like.” “oh, i forgot! a letter came for you yesterday while you were out.” “a letter! for me? from whom?” “i don’t know from whom. i paid the mailman three kopecks. will you pay me back?” “bring it to me, for heaven’s sake, bring it!” raskolnikov cried in great excitement. a minute later, the letter appeared. just as he thought: it was from his mother, in ryazan province. he even turned pale"
dostoevsky,"as he took it. he hadn’t received any letters in some time; but now something else suddenly took hold of his heart. “nastasya, go away, for heaven’s sake; here’s your three kopecks, only go away right now, for heaven’s sake!” the letter trembled in his hands: he didn’t want to open it in her presence: he wanted to be alone with the letter. after nastasya left, he quickly raised the letter to his lips and kissed it; then for a long time he gazed at the handwriting of the address, at his mother’s familiar, beloved, tiny slanted writing, she who’d once taught him how to read and write. he took his time; he even seemed afraid of something. he finally opened it: the letter was long, thick, and weighed almost a full ounce; two large pieces of writing paper were covered with tiny script. “my dear rodya,” his mother wrote. “it’s been more than two months since i’ve written you a letter, as a result of which i’ve suffered, at times even lost sleep, wondering about you. but most likely you won’t blame me for my unintended silence. you know how i love you; you’re all we have, dunya and i, you mean everything to us, all our hope, all our aspiration. i was so upset when i learned that you’d left the university several months ago because you were unable to support yourself, and that your lessons and other sources had ended! how could i help you with my pension of only one hundred and twenty rubles a year? as you well know, i’d borrowed those fifteen rubles i sent you four months ago from our local merchant afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin, on the promise of my pension. he’s a good man and was your father’s acquaintance. but in giving him the right to receive my pension for me, i was obliged to wait until i repaid my debt, and that’s only just happened, so all this time i haven’t been able to send you anything. but now, thank god, it seems i can send you some more; in general, we can even boast of good fortune now about which i hasten to inform you. in the first place, could you guess, dear rodya, that your dear sister has been living with me for the last month and a half, and we’ll no longer be separated in the future. praise the lord, her torments have ended, but i’ll tell you everything in order, so you’ll know what’s happened and what we’ve been keeping from you up to now. when you wrote to me about two months ago that you’d heard from someone or other that dunya had to endure much rudeness in mr. svidrigaylov’s house and you asked me for a more detailed explanation—what could i write to you at that time? if i’d told you the whole truth, you’d probably have dropped everything and rushed to see us, even come on foot, because i know your character and your feelings, and you wouldn’t have allowed your sister to be insulted. i myself was in despair, but what could i do? even i didn’t know the whole truth then. the main difficulty was that dunya, who’d entered their household last year as a governess, had received an advance of one hundred rubles, on the condition that a certain amount would be deducted from her salary each month; therefore, she couldn’t leave her position until she’d repaid her debt. this amount (i can now explain it all to you, precious rodya) she’d accepted mostly so she could send you sixty rubles, which you needed then and which you received from us last year. at the time we deceived you, writing that it had come from dunya’s savings, but that wasn’t so. now i’m telling you the whole truth because everything’s suddenly changed, by the will of god, for the better, and so you’ll know how much dunya loves you and what a precious heart she has. as a matter of fact, right from the start mr. svidrigaylov treated her very rudely and made various impolite remarks and insults to her at the table. . . . but i don’t want to dwell on these agonizing difficulties and upset you for no reason, since all of that’s stopped. in brief, in spite of the kind and generous treatment by marfa petrovna, mr. svidrigaylov’s wife, and all the servants, dunechka had a very difficult time, especially when mr. svidrigaylov, following old regimental custom, was under the influence of bacchus. but what happened afterward? just imagine that this madman had conceived a passion for dunya sometime earlier, but had been concealing it under the guise of rudeness and contempt for her. perhaps he himself was ashamed and horrified to see that he himself, at his age and as the father of a family, harbored such frivolous hopes; therefore, he inadvertently took his anger out on dunya. perhaps by his rude treatment and mockery he wanted to hide the whole truth from other people. but, in the end, he couldn’t restrain himself and dared make an open and vile proposition to dunya, promising her various rewards; moreover, he said he would forsake everything and go to another village with her or, perhaps, even abroad. you can imagine her suffering! it was impossible for her to leave her position at that time, not only because of her financial obligation, but because she wanted to spare marfa petrovna, who might suddenly conceive a hatred for her, and consequently arouse discord in the household. it would create a huge scandal for dunechka; she’d never be able to escape it. there were many other reasons why dunya couldn’t consider removing herself from this horrible house earlier than six weeks. of course, you know dunya, you know how clever she is and what a strong character she has. she can tolerate many things and find so much generosity within herself even in the most extreme circumstances, so as not to"
dostoevsky,"lose her strength. she didn’t even write to me about all this so as not to upset me, though we often exchanged news. the finale was unexpected. marfa petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring dunechka in the garden. misinterpreting the whole affair, she blamed dunya for everything, thinking that she was the cause of it all. it occasioned a terrible scene right there in the garden: marfa petrovna even struck her, and didn’t want to listen to reason. she shouted for a whole hour and finally ordered that dunya be sent back to me in town on a simple peasant’s cart, onto which they tossed all her things, linens, dresses, in any which way, untied and unpacked. then it began to pour down rain; dunya, insulted and disgraced, had to make the trip, all eleven miles, with a peasant in an open cart. now just imagine, how and what could i write in reply to your letter that i’d received two months ago? i myself was in despair. i dared not tell you the truth because you’d be so unhappy, bitter, and angry. and what could you do? you might have gotten yourself into trouble; besides, dunya wouldn’t allow it. i couldn’t just fill my letter with nonsense about this and that, when i felt such sorrow in my soul. rumors about this episode circulated through the whole town for an entire month, and it reached the point where dunya and i couldn’t even go to church because of all the contemptuous looks and whispers. remarks were even uttered aloud in our presence. all of our acquaintances shunned us, and everyone stopped greeting us. i learned for certain that some merchants’ shop assistants and some office clerks wanted to insult us in the worst possible way by tarring the gates of our house so that the landlord would demand that we vacate our apartment. the cause of all this was marfa petrovna, who’d managed to denounce and slander dunya in every household. she was acquainted with everyone in town, and during that month she visited town continually. she’s somewhat talkative and loves to go on about family matters, especially complaining about her husband to each and every person, which is not a good thing; so she spread the whole story in a very short time, not only in town, but throughout the district. i fell ill, but dunya was stronger than i was; if you’d only seen how she endured it all and how she consoled and reassured me! she’s an angel! but, by god’s grace, our torments ended. mr. svidrigaylov thought better of it, repented, probably taking pity on dunya, and presented to marfa petrovna clear and complete evidence of dunya’s innocence, namely this: a letter that dunya had felt compelled to write and convey to him, even before marfa petrovna came upon them in the garden, one that remained in his possession after dunya’s departure. the note asked him to cease these personal declarations and secret meetings that he’d insisted on. in this letter she reproached him in the most impassioned way and with total indignation for his dishonorable treatment of marfa petrovna. she reminded him that he was a father and the head of a household, and, finally, she said how vile it was for him to torment and distress a young woman who was already in distress and defenseless. in a word, dear rodya, this letter was so nobly and poignantly written that i sobbed while reading it and to this day can’t do so without shedding tears. contributing to dunya’s exoneration came the testimony of those servants who saw and knew much more than mr. svidrigaylov supposed, as always happens. marfa petrovna was completely astounded and ‘once again crushed,’ as she herself acknowledged; on the other hand, she was fully convinced of dunechka’s innocence. the very next day, sunday, heading directly to church, she tearfully implored our lady to give her the strength to bear this new ordeal and carry out her duty. then, right after church, without making any stops, she came to us and told us everything. she wept bitterly and, with full repentance, embraced dunya and begged her forgiveness. that same morning, without tarrying, she set off right from our house to all the households in town, and in each one, shedding tears, she restored dunya’s innocence and the nobility of her feelings and behavior in the most flattering terms. she showed everyone dunechka’s handwritten letter to mr. svidrigaylov, read it aloud, and even allowed people to make copies of it (which, it seems to me, was going too far). in this way it took her several days to visit everyone in town, so that some people felt offended that she was partial to others. lines were formed since she was expected in advance at every household and everyone knew that on such and such a day marfa petrovna would read the letter there. at each reading, people would line up who’d already heard the letter read several times in their own homes and in those of their other acquaintances. in my opinion, much of this, very much, was unnecessary; but such was marfa petrovna’s character. at least she fully restored dunechka’s honor. all the vileness of this affair left an indelible disgrace on her husband as the main culprit, so that i even began to feel sorry for him. people dealt too severely with that madman. soon dunya was invited to give lessons in several households, but she refused. in general, people suddenly began treating her with special respect. all of this served principally to further the unexpected circumstance by which, one can say, our entire fate is now being altered. you should know, dear rodya, that a suitor has proposed to dunya and she’s already given her consent, which i’m writing to inform you about immediately. even though this matter was conducted without your advice, you probably won’t bear any grudge either against me or your sister, since you yourself"
dostoevsky,"will see, from the facts, that it was impossible to delay or wait for your answer to arrive. besides, you yourself couldn’t have judged it accurately without being here. this is how it happened. he’s already a court councillor, this petr petrovich luzhin, a distant relative of marfa petrovna’s, who herself helped a great deal in this affair. it all began with his expressing a desire through her that he wished to make our acquaintance; he was received properly, had some coffee, and the next day sent a letter in which he very politely stated his proposal and asked for a swift and definitive answer. he’s a practical, busy man, just about to leave for petersburg, so he values every minute. of course, at first we were very surprised, since all this took place so swiftly and unexpectedly. all that day we pondered and considered it together. he’s a reliable, well-to-do person, works in two places, and has already amassed some capital. it’s true that he’s forty-five, but he has a rather pleasant appearance and can still be attractive to women; he’s also an extremely solid and decent man, only a little gloomy and a bit arrogant. but perhaps it only seems that way, at first glance. i advise you, dear rodya, when you meet him in petersburg, which will happen quite soon, not to judge him too quickly and heatedly, as you sometimes do, if at first glance you think something about him is not quite right. i say this just in case, although i’m sure that he’ll make a pleasant impression on you. besides, in order to determine what sort of person he is, one must deal with him gradually and carefully, so as not to fall into error or prejudice, which is difficult to correct or smooth over afterward. and petr petrovich, at least from many indications, is an extremely respectable man. on his first visit, he stated that he was a positive person; he shares to a large extent, as he himself explained it, ‘the convictions of our younger generation,’ and he is an enemy of all prejudices. he said a great many other things because he seems a bit vain and very much likes to be listened to, but that’s almost not a fault. of course, i understood very little, but dunya explained to me that although he is not a well-educated man, he is clever and, it seems, kind. you know your sister’s character, rodya. she’s a strong young woman, sensible, patient, and generous, although she has an impassioned heart, as i’ve come to know well. of course, there’s no particular love involved, either on her side or on his, but dunya, in addition to being a clever young woman, is also a lofty creature—an angel. she’ll consider it her duty to make her husband happy, and he, in turn, will concern himself with his wife’s happiness, which, for the time being, we have no major reason to doubt, even though, i must admit, this whole affair was concluded rather quickly. besides, he’s a very prudent man and of course will realize that his own conjugal happiness will be more assured the happier dunechka is with him. as for the fact that there are some irregularities in his character, some old habits, even some disagreement in their views (which can’t be avoided even in the happiest of marriages), on that count dunechka told me that she’s relying on herself and there’s no reason to be concerned, that she can tolerate a great deal on the condition that their future relations will be fair and honest. for example, he seemed a bit harsh to me at first; but that could be precisely because he’s such a straightforward man, and it’s absolutely so. for example, during his second visit, after he’d already received her consent, he expressed in our conversation that previously, even before he knew dunya, he’d intended to marry an honest young woman, but one without a dowry, and certainly one who’d already experienced poverty; because, as he explained, a husband should in no way be obligated to his wife, and that it’s much better if the wife considers her husband to be her benefactor. i’ll add that he expressed himself a little more gently and affectionately than i described, but i’ve forgotten his exact words, and recall only the idea; besides, he said it without any premeditation. obviously it just slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that afterward he even tried to correct himself and soften it. but it still seemed somewhat harsh to me, and i conveyed this to dunya later. but she replied, even somewhat annoyed, that ‘words are not the same as deeds,’ and of course that’s fair. before deciding, dunechka didn’t sleep the whole night; supposing that i was already asleep, she got out of bed and spent the whole night pacing back and forth in the room. finally she knelt down and prayed fervently in front of the icon for a long time; in the morning, she announced to me that she’d made a decision. “i’ve already mentioned that petr petrovich is now heading to petersburg. he has important business there, since he wants to open a public lawyer’s office in the capital. he’s been engaged for a while in various legal actions and lawsuits, and a few days ago he won an important case. he has to go to petersburg because he has an important matter pending in the senate. thus, dear rodya, he might prove extremely useful for you in all sorts of ways; dunya and i have already supposed that you, even from this day forward, might definitely launch your future career and consider your fate now clearly determined. oh, if only this were to come to pass! it would be such a benefit that one would have to regard it as nothing other than a gift to us directly from the almighty. dunya dreams only about this. we even dared mention a"
dostoevsky,"few words on this account to petr petrovich. he expressed himself cautiously and said that of course, since he wouldn’t be able to get along without a secretary, naturally it would be better to pay a salary to a relative, rather than to a stranger, if that person turns out to be competent to carry out his duties (as if you could turn out to be incompetent!). then he expressed his doubt that your studies at the university would allow you time to work in his office. the matter was left there for the moment, but now dunya can think about nothing but this. for the last few days, she’s simply been in a sort of excited state and has devised an entire scheme about how you could become petr petrovich’s comrade and even his partner in his legal affairs, all the more so since you yourself are studying law. i’m in complete agreement with her, rodya, and share all her plans and hopes, seeing their complete likelihood. in spite of petr petrovich’s present, extremely understandable evasiveness (because he doesn’t know you yet), dunya’s quite sure that she’ll manage it all by means of her good influence over her future husband, and she’s convinced of that. of course, we were careful not to let anything slip out about these future dreams of ours, especially about your becoming his partner. he’s a pragmatic person and might take it very coolly, since all this might seem to him to be only dreams. similarly, neither dunya nor i have said a word to him about our strong hope that he would help us support you financially while you’re at the university. we didn’t talk about it, first because it might happen later of its own accord; probably, he himself, without unnecessary words, will propose it (as if he could refuse this to dunya), all the more so since you yourself might become his right-hand man in the office and then you would receive this assistance not in the form of charity, but as earned income. that’s what dunya wants to arrange and i agree with her completely. the second reason we didn’t say anything was because i particularly wanted to put you on an equal footing with him at our impending meeting with him. when dunya told him about you with such enthusiasm, he replied that one must first take a close look at anyone to form a judgment about him, and that he would reserve for himself the right to form his own opinion of you until he made your acquaintance. you know, my precious rodya, it seems to me, for several reasons (however, by no means related to petr petrovich, but just so, for some of my very own, personal, perhaps even old-womanish whims)—it seems to me that perhaps i’d be better off if, after their wedding, i were to live on my own, as i do now, and not with them. i’m absolutely sure that he’d be so generous and considerate as to invite me and propose that i not be separated from my daughter. if he hasn’t said so up to now, naturally it’s because that’s what he intends even without words; but i’ll refuse. i’ve noticed more than once in life that husbands are not very fond of their mothers-in-law; not only do i not want to be the slightest burden to anyone, but i myself want to be completely free, while i still have my own crust of bread to eat and children such as you and dunechka. if possible, i’ll settle somewhere near both of you, because, rodya, i saved the most pleasant news for the end of my letter: you should know, my dear, that very soon we may all be together again and the three of us will embrace after our separation of almost three years! it’s definitely been decided that dunya and i will leave for petersburg, i don’t know exactly when, but, in any case, very, very soon, perhaps even in a week. everything depends on the instructions of petr petrovich, who will let us know as soon as he gets his bearings in petersburg. for several reasons he wants to hasten the marriage ceremony and even, if possible, hold the wedding before the next church fast, and if that doesn’t work, then as soon as possible after the fast of the assumption. oh, i’ll take you to my heart with such happiness! dunya’s excited and elated at the prospect of seeing you, and once she said, as a joke, that she’d marry petr petrovich for that reason alone. she’s an angel! she has nothing to add for you now, but she told me to write only that she has so many things to talk over with you, so very many things, that she won’t even pick up a pen now because she couldn’t convey it all in just a few lines, and she’d only upset herself; she told me to send you her warmest embrace and countless kisses. but, in spite of the fact that we may very soon be meeting in person, i’ll still be sending you some money in a few days, as much as i can. now that everyone has learned that she’ll be marrying petr petrovich, my credit has suddenly improved, and i know for sure that afanasy ivanovich will trust me, on account of my pension, even up to seventy-five rubles, so i may be able to send you twenty-five or thirty rubles. i’d send you more, but i’m concerned about our expenses for the trip. although petr petrovich was kind enough to take upon himself a portion of the cost of our journey to the capital, namely, he offered to convey at his expense our baggage and a large trunk (somehow through his acquaintances there), we still have to consider our arrival in petersburg, where we can’t show up without a kopeck, if only for the first few days. meanwhile, dunechka and i have calculated"
dostoevsky,"everything precisely, and it turns out that the trip will cost us very little. we’re only sixty miles from the railroad station, so just in case, we’ve made an agreement with a peasant driver here whom we know. and after that, dunechka and i will happily travel in a third-class railway car. thus, i may manage to send you not twenty-five rubles, but more likely thirty. enough: i’ve completely filled two entire sheets, and there’s no space left; it’s our whole story: so many events have accumulated! and now, my precious rodya, i embrace you until our upcoming meeting and i give you my maternal blessing. love dunya, your sister, rodya; love her as she loves you, and know that she loves you without limit, more than she loves herself. she’s an angel; and you, rodya, you mean everything to us, all our hope, all our aspiration. if only you’re happy, then we’ll be happy, too. are you still saying your prayers to god, rodya, as you did before, and do you still believe in the goodness of our creator and savior? i’m afraid in my heart that you may have been visited by the latest fashionable disbelief. if that’s so, then i pray for you. remember, my dear, how in your childhood, when your father was still alive, you mumbled your prayers on my lap and how happy we all were then! good-bye, or, rather, till we meet! i embrace you very, very warmly and kiss you endlessly. yours till the grave, pulkheriya raskolnikova” almost all the while raskolnikov was reading, from the very beginning of the letter, his face was bathed in tears. however, after he’d finished, his face was pale, distorted by a spasm, and a painful, angry, spiteful smile curled on his lips. he lay his head down on his meager, worn-out pillow, and he thought; he thought for a long time. his heart was pounding, and his thoughts were violently agitated. at last he felt stifled and cramped in that little yellow room of his, which resembled a cupboard or a trunk. his gaze and his thoughts demanded space. he grabbed his hat and left, this time no longer afraid of meeting anyone on the staircase; he’d forgotten all about that. he took a route across voznesensky prospect toward vasilievsky island, as if hastening there on business, but, as was his custom, he walked without noticing the street, whispering and even talking aloud to himself, which fact greatly astonished the passersby. many people thought he was drunk. oceanofpdf.com iv h is mother’s letter tormented him. but as far as the basic, most important point was concerned, he had no doubts even for one moment, even while he was reading the letter. the very heart of the matter was resolved in his mind, resolved once and for all: “this marriage will never take place as long as i live, and to hell with mr. luzhin!” “because this matter is obvious,” he muttered to himself, smirking and maliciously celebrating in advance the triumph of his decision. “no, mama, no dunya, you can’t deceive me! and what makes it even worse, they apologize for not asking my advice and for deciding the matter without me! i’ll say! they think it’s impossible to break it off now; we’ll see if it’s possible or not! what a splendid excuse: ‘petr petrovich, they say, is such a businesslike man that he can’t possibly get married in any other way than in a hurry, almost en route on a train.’ no, dunya, i can see everything, and i know what those many things are that you want to talk over with me; i also know what you worried about all night, pacing the room, and what you prayed about before the icon of our lady of kazan, * the one that mama has in her bedroom. it’s a steep climb to golgotha. † hmm . . . so, in other words, it’s been decided once and for all: you’re pleased, avdotya romanovna, to marry that practical, rational man who’s amassed his capital (who’s already amassed his capital; that’s more impressive, more imposing), who’s working in two places, who shares the convictions of our younger generation (as mama writes), and who ‘ seems to be a kind man,’ as dunya herself says. that word seems is the most splendid of all! and this same dunechka is planning to marry that seems ! splendid! splendid! “. . . however, i’m curious: why did mama write to me about ‘our younger generation’? simply to characterize that man or with some future goal in mind: to persuade me to look kindly on mr. luzhin? oh, how cunning! i’m curious to resolve one more aspect: to what extent were they both open with each other that day and night, and then during the following days? were all the words spoken honestly between them, or did they both understand that each of them felt the same thing in her heart and mind, and there was no reason to utter it aloud or to talk about it. most likely, that’s part of what happened; it’s clear from the letter: he seemed a bit harsh, and naïve mama let her views slip out to dunya, while she, of course, got angry and ‘replied somewhat annoyed.’ i’ll say! who wouldn’t be enraged when the matter’s so clear even without such naïve questions, when it’s all been decided, and there’s nothing more to say? then she writes to me, ‘love dunya, rodya; she loves you more than she loves herself’; isn’t that a feeling of remorse secretly tormenting her for having agreed to sacrifice her daughter for her son? ‘you’re our hope, you’re our everything!’ oh, mama!” spite was seething in him more and more intensely, and if he’d encountered mr. luzhin at that very moment, he might just have killed him! “hmm, it’s true,” he continued, pursuing the vortex of thoughts spinning in his head. “it’s true that ‘one must deal"
dostoevsky,"with him gradually and carefully to determine what sort of person he is,’ but mr. luzhin’s character is obvious. the main thing is ‘he’s a businesslike man’ and ‘ seems to be kind’: what a joke that he took the conveyance of their baggage upon himself and that he’s shipping a large trunk at his own expense! how could he be unkind? meanwhile, both of them, his fiancée and her mother, hire a peasant and will ride in his cart, covered with bast matting! (i’ve gone like that myself.) never mind! it’s only sixty miles and then ‘we’ll happily travel in a third-class railway car’ another six hundred miles. that’s sensible: you must cut your coat to fit your cloth; and you, mr. luzhin, what about it? after all, she’s your fiancée. . . . how could you not know that her mother’s borrowing money in advance against her pension to cover the cost of their journey? of course, here you have a common commercial transaction, an undertaking for mutual profit with equal shares; in other words, he’s splitting their expenses in half; ‘bread and salt in common, but bring your own tobacco,’ as the proverb says. but here that efficient man has hoodwinked them a bit: the baggage costs less than their passage and might even go for free. why don’t they both see it, or do they take no notice of it on purpose? but they’re content, content! just think, these are the flowers: the real fruit lies ahead! it’s not his stinginess or miserliness that’s important here, but the tone of it all. it’ll become the tone of their future marriage, it’s a prophecy. . . . and mama, why’s she splurging anyway? what’ll she have left after she arrives in petersburg? three silver rubles or two ‘little paper bills,’ as that . . . that old pawnbroker says? how does she plan to live in petersburg afterward? why, she’s already managed to guess for whatever reasons that it’ll be impossible for her and dunya to live together after the marriage, even at first. that nice man, most likely, somehow let it slip, he gave himself away, even though mama brushes it off completely, ‘i,’ she says, ‘i’ll refuse.’ well then, what will she rely upon: on her hundred and twenty ruble pension, after she deducts the money she owes afanasy ivanovich? she’ll knit little winter scarves or sew little sleeve covers, and ruin her aging eyes. but those little scarves will add only twenty rubles a year to her hundred and twenty, that much i know. that means they’ll still have to rely on mr. luzhin’s noble generosity: ‘he himself,’ she says, ‘he’ll propose it, he’ll entreat me.’ not a chance! it’s always the same with these schilleresque beautiful souls: ‡ up to the last moment they dress a person in peacock feathers, until the last moment they hope for the good, not the bad; and although they have a feeling about the other side of the coin, they won’t utter a single word about it to themselves for any reason. the thought alone offends them; they brush away the truth until the person they’ve so embellished rubs their noses in it with his own hands. i’m curious as to whether mr. luzhin has received any official decorations; i’ll bet he has the order of saint anna § and that he wears it at dinners with contractors and merchants. he might even put it on for his wedding. but to hell with him! “well, never mind mama, she can think what she wants—that’s who she is; but what about dunya? dear dunechka, i know you so well! you were almost twenty the last time we saw each other: i understood your character already. mama writes that ‘you can tolerate many things.’ that much i knew. i knew that two and a half years ago and have been thinking about it since then, precisely about this, that ‘dunya can tolerate many things.’ if she can bear mr. svidrigaylov and all the aftermath, that means she really has a high tolerance. now she imagines, together with mama, that she can even tolerate mr. luzhin, expounding his theory regarding the advantage of wives rescued from poverty and husbands who do them such a great honor and make it clear at their very first meeting. well, then, let’s suppose he did ‘let it slip,’ even though he’s a rational man (so perhaps he didn’t let it slip at all, but intended to spell it out as early as possible); but dunya, what about dunya? it must have been clear to her what sort of person he was and with whom she’d have to live. she would eat only black bread and drink only water rather than sell her soul or give up her moral freedom in exchange for comfort; she wouldn’t trade it for all of schleswig-holstein, ¶ let alone for mr. luzhin. no, that wasn’t the dunya i knew, and . . . and she can’t have changed that much now! that’s for sure! those svidrigaylovs are tough! it’s hard to spend your whole life as a governess earning only two hundred rubles and traipsing around the provinces; but still i know my sister would sooner go work with negroes on a plantation or with latvian peasants for a baltic german # than defile her spirit and her moral feelings by a relationship with a man she doesn’t respect and with whom she has nothing in common—forever, merely for personal gain! even if mr. luzhin were made of the purest gold or solid diamond, even then she wouldn’t agree to become mr. luzhin’s legal concubine! why is she agreeing now? what’s the point? what’s the answer? it’s clear: she wouldn’t sell herself on her own, for her own comfort, even to save herself from death, but she would sell herself for someone else! she’d sell herself for a dear, beloved person! that’s the crux of the matter: she’s selling"
dostoevsky,"herself for her brother and for her mother! she’ll sell everything! oh, with such an opportunity we’ll suppress moral feeling; we’ll bring our freedom, serenity, even our conscience, everything, everything to the flea market. to hell with life! as long as our beloved creatures are happy. moreover, we’ll devise our own casuistry, we’ll learn from the jesuits, and perhaps we’ll reassure ourselves for a while, persuade ourselves that it’s necessary, really necessary for a good cause. that’s just how we are and it’s clear as day. it’s clear there’s no one else involved except rodion romanovich raskolnikov, standing front and center. yes, indeed, we can arrange for his happiness, support him at the university, make him a partner in the law office, guarantee his entire future; perhaps afterward he’ll become wealthy, honored, and respected, maybe end up famous. and mother? why here’s her rodya, her precious rodya, her firstborn! how could she not sacrifice a daughter for such a firstborn son? oh, loving, unjust hearts! what of it? perhaps we wouldn’t even reject sonechka’s fate! sonechka, sonechka marmeladova, eternal sonechka, as long as the world lasts! the sacrifice, have you both measured the enormous sacrifice? really? are you strong enough? will it succeed? is it sensible? do you realize, dunya, that sonechka’s fate is no worse than yours would be with mr. luzhin? ‘there’s no particular love involved,’ mama writes. but what if there’s disgust, contempt, loathing—then what? then it turns out, once more, of course, that you have to ‘ keep yourself clean .’ isn’t that right? do you understand, do you really understand what that cleanliness entails? do you understand that luzhin’s idea of cleanliness is just the same as sonechka’s, perhaps even worse, nastier, filthier, because you, dunechka, can count on a life of luxury, whereas with sonya, it’s simply a matter of life and death! ‘this cleanliness is costly, dunechka, very costly!’ well, and if you’re not up to it, will you repent? so much sorrow, grief, curses, and tears hidden from everyone, so much, because you’re no marfa petrovna, are you? and what’ll happen to our mother then? why, even now she’s distraught, she’s suffering; but what about then, when she sees everything as it really is? what about me? what did you really think of me? i don’t want your sacrifice, dunya; i don’t want it, mama! it won’t take place as long as i live, it won’t, it won’t! i won’t accept it!” he suddenly came to his senses and stopped. “it won’t take place? what’ll you do so that it won’t? forbid it? what right do you have? what can you promise them in return to have such a right? to devote your whole destiny to them, your future, when you complete your course of studies and attain a position ? we’ve heard all that before, and it’s just an attempt to frighten us, but now? you have to do something right now, do you understand? what are you doing in the meantime? you’re robbing them. they get their money as credit against that hundred-ruble pension or as an advance from the svidrigaylovs! how will you protect them from those svidrigaylovs or from afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin, you future millionaire, you, you zeus, disposing of their fates? in ten years? but in ten years, mother will have managed to go blind from knitting scarves and perhaps from shedding tears; she’ll waste away from fasting; and my sister? well, just think what can happen to her in ten years or during that time? can you guess?” that’s how raskolnikov tortured and teased himself with these questions, even deriving some enjoyment from it. besides, all these questions weren’t new or unexpected, but old ones, painful, and persistent. they’d begun tormenting him a long time ago and had rent his heart to pieces. all this current anguish had taken root in him ages ago; it had grown, accumulated, and of late matured and intensified, having assumed the form of a terrible, wild, fantastic question that tormented his heart and mind, irresistibly demanding a solution. now the letter from his mother had suddenly struck him like a thunderbolt. clearly it was unnecessary to be dejected now or to suffer passively, merely considering these questions insoluble; instead, it was absolutely necessary to do something right now, as soon as possible. no matter what, he had to decide to do something, or else . . . “or renounce life altogether!” he cried suddenly in a frenzy. “submit to fate as it is, once and for all, and stifle everything in me, rejecting any right to act, live, or love!” “ ‘do you understand, do you really understand, dear sir, what it means when a person has nowhere else to go?’ ” all of a sudden he recalled marmeladov’s question from the day before. ‘because everyone has to have somewhere to go . . .’ ” he suddenly shuddered: one thought, also from the day before, flashed through his mind again. but he hadn’t shuddered because of that thought. he’d known, he’d had a premonition, that it would “flash through” his mind and he’d already been expecting it; and this thought was not from the day before at all. but the difference was that a month ago, even as recently as yesterday, it had been only a daydream, but now . . . now it suddenly appeared not as a daydream, but in some new, awe-inspiring, completely unfamiliar form, and all of a sudden he himself became aware of it. . . . his head throbbed, and things grew dark before his eyes. he glanced around hurriedly; he was looking for something. he wanted to sit down and was searching for a bench. just then he was making his way along konnogvardeisky boulevard. a bench was visible in the distance, about a hundred paces ahead. he walked as quickly as he could, but along the way he had a little adventure that attracted all his attention for a few minutes."
dostoevsky,"looking for a bench, he noticed just in front of himself, some twenty paces ahead, a woman walking along the street. at first, he paid her no attention, just as he hadn’t focused on other things appearing before him up to now. many times it had happened that he was walking home and didn’t recall the route he’d taken; he’d grown used to that. but there was something strange about this woman that caught his eye from the first glance, so that gradually his attention began to be focused on her—reluctantly at first, as if with annoyance, but then it grew stronger and stronger. suddenly he wanted to understand precisely what was so strange about her. first of all, she must have been a very young woman; she was walking along bareheaded in the heat, without parasol or gloves, waving her arms in a ludicrous manner. she was wearing a silk dress made of some light fabric (“some kind of cloth”), but in a very odd way, scarcely fastened, and torn at the waist in the back, a large piece of material detached and hanging loose; a little scarf had been tossed over her bare neck, but it protruded crookedly to one side. to top it all off, the young woman was walking unsteadily, stumbling, even swaying from side to side. in the end, this encounter attracted all of raskolnikov’s attention. he caught up with the young woman at the bench, but, upon reaching it, she collapsed into one corner, threw her head against the back of the bench, and closed her eyes, obviously from extreme exhaustion. examining her closely, he guessed at once that she was completely drunk. it was a strange and absurd sight to behold. he even wondered whether he might be mistaken. before him was an extremely young face, about sixteen, perhaps even only fifteen—a little face, under fair hair, pretty, but quite flushed and seemingly swollen. the young woman seemed to understand very little; she had crossed one leg over the other and was displaying more of it than was proper, and, by all indications, she had very little awareness that she was outside on the street. raskolnikov didn’t sit down and didn’t want to walk away; he stood in front of her in a quandary. this boulevard was always deserted, and now, after one o’clock and in such heat, there was almost no one there at all. however, just to one side, about fifteen paces away, at the edge of the street, stood a gentleman, who, by all appearances, also very much wanted to approach the young woman for some purpose. he, too, had probably seen her from a distance and was trying to catch up with her, but raskolnikov had hindered him. the gentleman cast angry glances at him, trying, however, not to make them too obvious, waiting his turn impatiently until the annoying vagabond left. the matter was clear. this gentleman was about thirty, stout, plump, hale and hearty, with pink lips, a little mustache, and very foppishly dressed. raskolnikov got very angry; he suddenly wanted to insult this fat dandy. for a moment, he left the young woman and approached the gentleman. “hey you, you svidrigaylov! what do you want here?” he cried, clenching his fists and laughing, his lips foaming with rage. “what’s the meaning of this?” the gentleman asked sternly, frowning in haughty astonishment. “clear off, that’s what!” “how dare you, you scum!” he brandished his switch. raskolnikov threw himself at the man with his fists, without even considering that the plump gentleman could easily get the better of two men his size. but just at that moment someone grabbed him forcefully from behind: a policeman now stood between them. “enough, gentlemen, we’ll have no fighting in public places, if you please. what do you want? who are you?” he asked raskolnikov sternly, noticing his tattered clothes. raskolnikov looked at him attentively. he had a manly soldier’s face, with a gray mustache, sideburns, and an intelligent expression. “you’re exactly what i want,” he cried, grabbing him by the arm. “i’m a former student, raskolnikov. . . . you should know that, too,” he said, turning to the gentleman. “please come along with me; i’ll show you something . . .” after taking the policeman by the arm, he pulled him over to the bench. “here, look, she’s completely drunk and was just walking along the boulevard; heaven knows who she is or where she’s from, but she doesn’t look like that’s her profession. most likely someone got her drunk and tricked her . . . for the first time . . . you understand? then they turned her loose onto the street. look, her dress is torn; you can see how it was put on: someone else dressed her, she didn’t do it herself, and it was by someone’s clumsy hands, men’s hands. that’s obvious. and now look over here at this dandy, with whom i was just about to fight; i’m not acquainted with him; this is the first time i’ve seen him. he, too, must have noticed along his way that she was drunk and unaware of where she was and now he very much wants to go up and grab her—since she’s in such a state—and take her off somewhere. . . . that’s probably what’s happening; believe me, i’m not mistaken. i myself saw him observing and following her, but i interfered, and now he’s waiting until i leave. he’s just withdrawn a little, as if to roll a cigarette. . . . how can we get her away from him? how can we get her home? think hard!” the policeman understood everything in an instant and thought about it. the fat gentleman’s intention, of course, was easily explicable, but there was the girl. the officer bent over to get a closer look at her, his features reflecting genuine compassion. “ah, what a shame!” he said, shaking his head. “she’s still just a child. they"
dostoevsky,"tricked her, that’s for sure. listen here, miss,” he said to her. “where might you live?” the young woman opened her tired, bleary eyes, regarded her interrogators dully, and waved them away with her arm. “listen,” said raskolnikov, “here.” (he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out twenty kopecks he found there.) “here, call a cab and have him take her home. if only we could find out her address!” “young lady, hey, young lady,” the policeman began again, after taking the money. “i’ll call you a cab and get you home myself. where to? huh? where might you be living?” “g’way! wha’ pests!” muttered the girl, waving her arm again. “ah, dear me, this is bad! ah, aren’t you ashamed, young lady? what a shame!” he said, shaking his head again, feeling embarrassed, compassionate, and indignant. “what a dilemma!” he said, turning to raskolnikov, right there and then looking him over rapidly from head to toe. raskolnikov must have appeared a bit strange to the policeman: he was in tatters, yet was giving away his own money! “did you come upon them far from here?” he asked. “i tell you, she was walking ahead of me, swaying, right here along the boulevard. when she reached this bench, she collapsed.” “ah, what shameful things occur nowadays in this world, oh lord! such a simple girl, and drunk already! she’s been tricked, that’s for sure. and her dress is torn. . . . ah, there’s such depravity in this day and age! she’s probably from a good family, but without much money. . . . there are many young women just like her nowadays. she looks delicate, too, as if she might be a lady.” he bent over her once more. perhaps he had daughters of his own like her—“as if she might be a lady and looks delicate,” well mannered and already imitating all the latest fashions . . . “the main thing is,” raskolnikov entreated, “to get her away from that scoundrel! why is he still here, threatening to commit some outrage? it’s absolutely clear what he wants. what a scoundrel, and he won’t go away!” raskolnikov spoke loudly and pointed directly at him. the man heard him and was about to get angry again, but reconsidered and limited himself merely to a contemptuous glance. then he slowly withdrew ten paces or so farther and stopped again. “we may be able to get her away from him, sir,” replied the police officer thoughtfully. “if only she’d tell us where to take her, otherwise. . . . young lady, young lady!” he said, leaning over her. all of a sudden she opened her eyes wide, looked attentively, as if she understood something or other, stood up from the bench, and walked back in the direction she’d come from. “phew, these shameless beasts, always pesterin’ me!” she muttered, waving her arm once again. she walked quickly, swaying violently as she had before. the dandy followed her, but along the opposite side of the boulevard, and didn’t take his eyes off her. “don’t worry, i won’t let him get her, sir,” said the mustachioed policeman and set off after them. “hey, such depravity these days!” he repeated aloud with a sigh. at that moment, it was as if something stung raskolnikov and seemed to transform him in an instant. “hey, listen!” he yelled after the mustachioed policeman. he turned around. “forget it! what’s it to you? let it be! let him amuse himself.” (he pointed at the dandy.) “what’s it matter to you?” the policeman didn’t understand and stared at him wide-eyed. raskolnikov burst into laughter. “hey!” said the officer, waving his arm, and followed the dandy and the girl, probably thinking that raskolnikov was insane or something far worse. “he’s made off with my twenty kopecks,” raskolnikov muttered spitefully when left alone. “well, let him get some money from that fellow, too, and then he’ll let the girl go off with him, and that’ll be the end of it. . . . why am i getting involved here, trying to help? why should i help? what right do i have to help? let them devour each other alive—what’s it to me? how did i dare part with those twenty kopecks? were they really mine to give away?” in spite of these strange words, he felt very wretched. he sat down on the deserted bench. his thoughts were scattered. . . . in general, it was hard for him at that moment to think about anything at all. he wanted to sink into forgetfulness, to forget everything, then wake up and start all over again. “the poor girl!” he said, looking at the deserted corner of the bench. “she’ll come to her senses, weep for a while, and then her mother will find out. . . . at first she’ll beat her, then whip her, severely and shamefully, and then, perhaps, drive her away. . . . and if she doesn’t drive her away, darya frantsevna will get wind of it, and then my little girl will start scurrying from place to place. . . . then right to the hospital: that’s always how it is with those girls who live with their virtuous mothers and who fool around on the sly; well, and then to the hospital again . . . then vodka . . . and taverns . . . back to the hospital . . . in two or three years—she’ll be a cripple, and all in all she’ll get to live only to eighteen or nineteen. . . . as if i haven’t seen the likes of her? how have they all turned out? just like that. . . . phew! let her! that’s the way it has to be, they say. a certain percentage, they say, has to go away every year . . . go away somewhere . . . probably to the devil, so as to invigorate the rest and not interfere with them. a"
dostoevsky,"percentage! ** they really have such fine words: they’re so comforting and erudite. once stated, a percentage, there’s nothing more to worry about. if it had been some other word, well then . . . it might be more troubling. . . . what if dunechka somehow winds up in that percentage? if not that one, then a different one? “where am i going?” he wondered to himself. “it’s strange. i went out for some reason. as soon as i read the letter, i went out. . . . to vasilievsky island, i’m going to razumikhin, that’s where, right now . . . i remember. but why on earth? why exactly did the thought enter my mind to visit razumikhin now? that’s remarkable!” he was surprised at himself. razumikhin was one of his former comrades at the university. it was remarkable that raskolnikov, who’d been at the university, had hardly any comrades, avoided everyone, visited no one, and received them only unwillingly. soon everyone turned away from him. somehow he took no part whatsoever in general gatherings, conversations, amusements, anything. he studied diligently, unsparingly, and for that they respected him, but no one liked him. he was very poor and somehow arrogantly proud and uncommunicative; it was as if he were concealing something inside. to some of his comrades it seemed that he regarded them, everyone, from on high, as children, as if he’d surpassed them in his development, knowledge, and convictions, and regarded their convictions and interests as beneath him. for some reason, he’d become friends with razumikhin—that is, not exactly friends, but he was more sociable with him, more honest. but it was impossible to be in any other relationship with razumikhin. he was an unusually cheerful and sociable fellow, good-natured to the point of innocence. nevertheless, beneath this innocence were concealed both depth and dignity. his best friends realized this, and everyone liked him. he was very clever, although sometimes really naïve. his appearance was expressive—tall, thin, always badly shaven, and he had black hair. sometimes he got into brawls, and he was reputed to be a very strong man. one night, in a group, he floored all six and a half feet of an officer of the law with one blow. he could drink without limit, but could also abstain totally; at times he could be unacceptably mischievous, but he could also refrain from mischief completely. razumikhin was also remarkable in that no failures ever troubled him and no adverse circumstances could ever seem to weigh him down. he could be lodged even on a rooftop and endure intolerable hunger and extraordinary cold. he was very poor and he alone supported himself completely, earning money by some sort of work. he knew an enormous number of sources that he could draw upon, naturally, for extra work. one year he didn’t heat his room all winter and maintained that it was even more pleasant because a person can sleep better in the cold. at the present time, he had also been forced to leave the university, but not for long; with all his might he was hastening to improve his circumstances so that he could continue his studies. raskolnikov hadn’t been to see him for the last four months or so, and razumikhin didn’t even know where his friend’s apartment was. once somehow, about two months ago, they were about to meet on the street, but raskolnikov turned away and even crossed over to the other side of the street so he wouldn’t be noticed. but razumikhin, even though he did notice him, passed him by, not wishing to disturb his friend. * a famous russian icon depicting the virgin and kept in the kazan cathedral in petersburg. † according to the gospels, a site immediately outside jerusalem’s walls where jesus was crucified. ‡ an ironic reference to the lofty idealism of the german romantic writer friedrich schiller (–). § a decoration awarded for civilian service to the government. ¶ denmark, austria, and prussia were engaged in a war over these duchies in . # the plight of latvian peasants was much in the news in the s and s; they were frequently compared to black american slaves and to russian serfs. ** a reference to positivistic and utilitarian ethics. oceanofpdf.com v “a s a matter of fact, for some time i’ve been wanting to ask razumikhin for work, to arrange some lessons or something else for me . . .” raskolnikov thought, having hit upon this idea, “but how can he help me now? suppose he does arrange some lessons, suppose he even shares his last kopecks with me, if he has any to share, so that i could even buy some boots, have my clothes mended, and offer some lessons . . . hmm. well, and then what? what can i do with a few five-kopeck pieces? do i really need that now? in truth, it’s ridiculous that i’ve set out to see razumikhin . . .” the question of why he’d just set out for razumikhin’s agitated him more than he himself even realized; he searched anxiously for some sinister meaning for himself in this seemingly most ordinary action. “so, did i really want to resolve this whole matter with razumikhin alone and find a way out through him?” he asked himself in astonishment. he reflected, rubbed his forehead, and then, strange to say, after considerable thought, a very curious idea somehow unexpectedly, suddenly, almost of its own accord, entered his head. “hmm . . . to razumikhin,” he uttered suddenly with total composure, as if a definitive solution was contained within this idea, “i’ll go to razumikhin, of course i will . . . but—but not now. . . . i’ll go see him . . . on another day, i’ll go after that , when that’s already been done and everything will begin anew . . .” all of a sudden, he came to his senses. “after that, ” he cried, jumping"
dostoevsky,"up from the bench. “will that actually happen? will that really and truly occur?” he abandoned the bench and set off walking, almost running; he wanted to turn back, head home, but suddenly felt terribly repulsed by the idea of going home: it was there, in his corner, in that awful cupboard of a room, that that had been ripening for more than a month; he set off wherever his legs would carry him. his nervous trembling had become somewhat feverish; he even started shivering; he felt a chill, in spite of the great heat. he began, with a kind of effort, almost unconsciously, according to some inner necessity, to examine all the things he was encountering, as if urgently seeking diversion, but he didn’t succeed very well and continually lapsed into thought. when, shuddering, he once again lifted his head and glanced around, he immediately forgot what he’d been thinking about and even where he’d been going. in that way, he walked all across vasilievsky island and came out to the little neva, crossed a bridge, and turned toward the islands. * at first his tired eyes, accustomed to the dust of the city, the lime plaster, and the huge, crowded, oppressive buildings, took pleasure in the verdure and freshness. there was no stuffiness, no stench, no taverns. but soon these new, pleasant sensations also became painful and annoying. at times he stopped in front of some dacha adorned with greenery, looked through the fence, and in the distance, on the balconies and terraces, glimpsed fashionably dressed women and children running around in the garden. the flowers interested him particularly; he looked at them longest of all. he also encountered luxurious carriages and men and women on horseback; he followed them attentively with his eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from sight. once he stopped and counted his money: it turned out that he had about thirty kopecks. “i gave twenty to the policeman and three to nastasya for the letter—so yesterday i must have given the marmeladovs forty-seven or fifty kopecks,” he thought, calculating for some reason, but soon even forgot why he’d taken the money out of his pocket. he remembered why as he was passing an establishment, something like an eating house, and felt that he wanted to have a bite to eat. upon entering the building, he downed a shot of vodka and ate a little pie with some sort of filling. he finished it along the way. he hadn’t had any vodka for a long time and it had an immediate effect, although he had only one shot. his legs suddenly grew heavy, and he began to feel a strong urge to sleep. he started for home; but when he reached petrovsky island, he paused in complete exhaustion, turned off the road, walked over to some bushes, dropped down on the grass, and immediately fell sound asleep. in a morbid condition, our dreams are often distinguished by their extraordinary clarity, intensity, and a heightened resemblance to reality. sometimes an outrageous scene takes shape, yet its setting and its entire course of development are so plausible and possess such subtle, unexpected details artistically corresponding to the total picture, that the dreamer couldn’t possibly conceive of them while awake, even if he were an artist like pushkin or turgenev. such dreams, morbid dreams, are always remembered long afterward and produce a powerful impression on a person’s distraught and already overwrought organism. raskolnikov had a terrible dream. he dreamt of his childhood, while they were still living in their little town. he was a boy of about seven and was walking along with his father outside town late one holiday afternoon. it was a gray day; the weather was stifling, and the place looked exactly as he remembered it: when compared, it was much more obscure even in his memory than it now appeared in his dream. he could see the town very clearly, as if he held it in the palm of his hand; there were no trees nearby; somewhere very far away, on the edge of the horizon, was a small, dark thicket. a tavern stood a few paces beyond the last garden of the town; it was a large building and always made a very unpleasant impression on him; it even frightened him whenever he happened to walk past it with his father. there was always such a large crowd of people in front of it, shouting, laughing, cursing, howling in such dreadful, hoarse voices, and often brawling; people with such drunken and dreadful mugs were always lingering outside. . . . whenever he encountered them, he always pressed up against his father and trembled. the country road that ran past the tavern was always so dusty and black. it was a winding road; after about three hundred paces it curved to the right, toward the cemetery. a stone church with a green cupola stood in the middle of this cemetery; he used to go there once or twice a year with his father and mother when a requiem was being sung for his grandmother who’d died a long time ago and whom he’d never known. they always brought along a special dish on a white plate under a napkin; it was made of sweetened rice with raisins arranged on top in the shape of a cross. he loved this church and its ancient icons, most of which were lacking frames, and the old priest, with his quivering head. next to his grandmother’s grave, marked by a stone, was the small grave of his younger brother, who’d died at the age of six months, and whom he also hadn’t known and couldn’t remember; but he’d been told that he’d had a younger brother, and every time he visited the cemetery, he crossed himself devoutly and respectfully over the grave, bowing and kissing it. and this is what he dreamt: he’s walking along the road with his father toward the cemetery and"
dostoevsky,"going past the tavern; he’s holding his father’s hand and glancing over at it fearfully. this time something in particular draws his attention: it seems to be some special occasion with a motley crowd of townsfolk, peasant women and their husbands, and all sorts of riffraff. they’re all drunk and singing songs; next to the tavern porch stands a strange kind of cart. it’s one of those large ones to which they harness big draft horses to pull wares and barrels of wine. he’s always liked looking at these enormous horses, with their long manes, their heavy legs clomping along calmly at a steady pace, pulling mountainous loads, never straining, as if it were even easier for them to pull a load than an empty cart. but now, strange as it seems, a peasant’s small, scrawny, light brown nag is harnessed to such a large cart, one of those horses—he’s seen it often—that sometimes strain to pull some huge load of firewood or hay, especially if the cart has gotten stuck in the mud or a rut. the peasants always whip the horse so terribly, so very painfully, sometimes even across its muzzle and eyes, and he would always feel so sorry, so very sorry to witness it that he would feel like crying, and his mother would always lead him away from the window. now things are getting extremely boisterous: some very large and extremely drunken peasants in red and blue shirts, their heavy coats slung over their shoulders, come out of the tavern shouting, singing, and playing balalaikas. “git in, everyone git in!” shouts one peasant, a young lad with a thick neck and a fleshy face, red as a beet, “i’ll take ya all. git in!” but there is a burst of laughter and shouting: “that ol’ nag ain’t good for nothin’!” “hey, mikolka, you must be outta yer head to hitch that ol’ mare to yer cart!” “that poor ol’ horse must be twenty if she’s a day, lads!” “git in, i’ll take ya all!” mikolka shouts again, jumping in first, taking hold of the reins, and standing up straight in the front of the cart. “matvei went off with the bay,” he cries from the cart, “and as for this ol’ mare here, lads, she’s only breakin’ my heart: i don’t give a damn if it kills ’er; she ain’t worth her salt. git in, i tell ya! i’ll make ’er gallop! she’ll gallop, all right!” and he takes the whip in his hand, getting ready to thrash the horse with delight. “what the hell, git in!” laugh several people in the crowd. “you heard ’im, she’ll gallop!” “i bet she ain’t galloped in ten years.” “she will now!” “don’t pity ’er, lads; everyone, bring yer whips, git ready!” “that’s it! thrash ’er!” they all clamber into mikolka’s cart with guffaws and wisecracks. there are six lads and room for more. they take along a peasant woman, fat and ruddy. she’s wearing red calico, a headdress trimmed with beads, and fur slippers; she’s cracking nuts and cackling. the crowd’s also laughing; as a matter of fact, how could one keep from laughing at the idea of a broken-down old mare about to gallop, trying to pull such a heavy load! two lads in the cart grab their whips to help mikolka. the shout rings out: “pull!” the mare strains with all her might, but not only can’t she gallop, she can barely take a step forward; she merely scrapes her hooves, grunts, and cowers from the blows of the three whips raining down on her like hail. laughter redoubles in the cart and among the crowd, but mikolka grows angry and in his rage strikes the little mare with more blows, as if he really thinks she’ll be able to gallop. “take me along, too, lads!” shouts someone from the crowd who’s gotten a taste of the fun. “git in! everyone, git in!” cries mikolka. “she’ll take everyone. i’ll flog ’er!” and he whips her and whips her again; in his frenzy, he no longer knows what he’s doing. “papa, papa,” the boy cries to his father. “papa, what are they doing? papa, they’re beating the poor horse!” “let’s go, let’s go!” his father says. “they’re drunk, misbehaving, those fools: let’s go. don’t look!” he tries to lead his son away, but the boy breaks from his father’s arms; beside himself, he runs toward the horse. but the poor horse is on her last legs. gasping for breath, she stops, and then tries to pull again, about to drop. “beat ’er to death!” cries mikolka. “that’s what it’s come to. i’ll flog ’er!” “aren’t you a christian, you devil?” shouts one old man from the crowd. “just imagine, asking an ol’ horse like that to pull such a heavy load,” adds another. “you’ll do ’er in!” shouts a third. “leave me alone! she’s mine! † i can do what i want with ’er! git in, all of ya! everyone git in! i’m gonna make ’er gallop!” suddenly a roar of laughter rings forth and drowns out everything: the little mare couldn’t bear the hail of blows and had begun kicking feebly. even the old man can’t resist, and he starts laughing. indeed: such a broken-down old mare, still kicking! two lads from the crowd grab whips and run up to the little horse to start beating her flanks. one stands on each side. “on ’er muzzle, lash ’er eyes, ’er eyes!” mikolka screams. “let’s have a song, lads!” someone cries from the cart, and everyone joins in. a riotous song bursts forth, tambourines jingle, and whistles sound in the chorus. the peasant woman’s still cracking nuts and laughing. . . . the boy runs along the horse’s side, rushes ahead, and sees how they’re beating her across the eyes, right across her eyes! he starts to cry. his heart rises up in his chest, and his tears begin to flow. one of the men holding"
dostoevsky,"a whip lashes the boy across the face; he doesn’t feel it; he’s wringing his hands, shouting, and then hurls himself at the gray-haired old man with the gray beard, the one who’d been shaking his head before and condemning it all. one peasant woman takes him by the hand and tries to lead him away; but he breaks free from her and runs up to the horse again. the mare’s almost at her last gasp but begins kicking again. “to hell with ya!” screams mikolka in a fury. he throws his whip away, bends down, and pulls a long, thick wooden shaft from the bottom of his cart; he grabs hold of one end with both hands and raises it ominously above the mare. “he’ll crush ’er!” several people shout. “he’ll kill ’er!” “she’s mine!” screams mikolka, and swings the shaft with all his might. there is the sound of a heavy thud. “thrash ’er, go on! why’d ya stop?” voices cry out from the crowd. mikolka swings a second time, and another mighty blow lands on the unfortunate mare’s back. her hind end sinks down completely, but she jerks and tugs, pulls with her last ounce of strength in different directions, trying to get away; but six whips lash at her from all sides, and once again the shaft is swung and comes crashing down a third time, then a fourth, evenly, with all of the man’s might. mikolka’s so furious that he can’t finish her off with one blow. “she’s a tough one!” cry several in the crowd. “she’s about to go down, lads, this’ll do ’er in!” one enthusiast shouts from the crowd. “take an axe to ’er, that’s what! finish ’er off now!” shouts a third. “mosquitoes should eat you alive! make way!” mikolka shouts ferociously; he tosses the shaft aside, bends over the cart again, and pulls out an iron crowbar. “watch out!” he cries, and with all his strength he batters his poor little horse. the blow comes crashing down; the mare staggers, drops, tries to pull, but the crowbar comes crashing down again, full force across her back, and she sinks to the ground, as if all four legs had been cut out from under her with one fell swoop. “finish ’er off!” yells mikolka, and now, as if beside himself, he jumps down from the cart. a few lads, also red-faced and drunk, grab whatever comes to hand—whips, sticks, the shaft—and run up to the dying mare. mikolka stands on one side and begins to strike her back for no reason. the old nag stretches out her muzzle, gasps for breath, and dies. “he finished ’er off!” shout several voices in the crowd. “still, she didn’t gallop!” “she’s mine!” yells mikolka, the crowbar still in his hands, his eyes bloodshot. he stands there as if feeling sorry that there’s nothing more to strike. “it’s really true: you’re not a christian!” voices cry from the mob. but the poor boy’s now beside himself. with a shout he pushes his way through the crowd and runs to the mare, embraces her bloody, lifeless muzzle, and kisses her, kisses her eyes, her lips. . . . then he suddenly springs up and in a rage hurls himself at mikolka to pummel him with his little fists. at that moment his father, who’d been chasing him, finally grabs hold of him and leads him away from the crowd. “let’s go! let’s go!” he says to the boy. “let’s go home!” “papa! why did they . . . kill . . . the poor little horse?” he sobs, but his breath falters, and his words emerge as screams from his constricted chest. “they’re drunk, acting up; it’s none of our business. let’s go!” says his father. the boy puts his arms around him, but his chest feels tight. he wants to catch his breath, cries out, and wakes up. raskolnikov awoke in a sweat, his hair drenched from perspiration; he was panting and raised himself up on his elbows in horror. “thank heavens, it was only a dream!” he said, sitting up under the tree and taking in a deep breath. “but what’s this all about? is it a fever beginning? such a hideous dream!” he felt as if his whole body had endured a beating; his soul seemed confused and wretched. he sat up and rested his elbows on his knees, supporting his head with both hands. “oh, god!” he exclaimed. “will i really do it, will i really take an axe, hit her over the head with it, crush her skull? i’ll slip in the warm, sticky blood, break the lock, steal, and tremble; then i’ll hide, all covered in blood . . . with an axe. . . . oh, lord, will i really do it?” as he said this, he trembled like a leaf. “but what am i thinking?” he continued, exclaiming again as if in deep amazement. “i knew that i wouldn’t endure it, so why am i still tormenting myself? why just yesterday, yesterday, when i went to conduct that . . . test, even then i understood perfectly well that i wouldn’t endure it. . . . so what am i doing now? why am i still in doubt? only yesterday, going down the stairs, i realized how mean, vile, base, how base it all is . . . when i lay awake i felt nauseous and horrified by the idea alone. “no, i can’t go through it, i can’t! even if there’s no doubt whatsoever in all my calculations, even if everything i’ve decided this past month is clear as day, as correct as arithmetic. oh, lord! i still can’t do it! i can’t endure it, i can’t! why, why have i been tormenting myself?” he stood up, looked around in astonishment, as if wondering why he had come here, and set off for tuchkov bridge. he was pale, his eyes burning, all his limbs exhausted, but he"
dostoevsky,"suddenly seemed able to breathe more easily. he felt that he had gotten rid of a terrible burden, one that had been oppressing him for so long a time, and his soul suddenly seemed light and peaceful. “oh, lord!” he prayed. “show me the way, and i will renounce this cursed . . . scheme of mine!” crossing the bridge, he calmly and peacefully looked at the neva, at the bright setting of the burning red sun. in spite of his weakness, he didn’t even feel the least tiredness. it was as if an abscess on his heart that had been coming to a head all month had suddenly burst. freedom, freedom! now he was free from all those evil charms, sorcery, witchcraft, and delusions. afterward, when he recalled this moment and everything that happened to him during these days, minute by minute, point by point, piece by piece, one circumstance always struck him as a superstitious occurrence, even though in essence it wasn’t all that unusual, but later it constantly seemed to be a kind of premonition of his fate. namely: he could never understand or explain to himself why, so tired and worn out, when it would have been most advantageous for him to go home by the shortest, most direct route, instead he headed home across haymarket square, which was completely unnecessary. the detour was not long, but obvious and totally unneeded. of course he had returned home dozens of times without recalling the route he took. but why, he always asked himself, why did such an important, such a decisive meeting and, at the same time, such an extremely accidental meeting on the haymarket (where he had no reason at all to be), why did it take place then, at that hour, at that moment of his life, precisely when he was in that mood, precisely in those circumstances, when only it, that meeting, could have had the most crucial, most decisive impact on his entire fate? it was as if it had been waiting to ambush him! it was almost nine o’clock when he passed through the haymarket. all the merchants at their tables, stands, shops, and stalls were locking up their establishments, removing and packing up their wares, and dispersing to their homes, just as their customers were. around the eating houses on the filthy, stinking lower floors of the buildings on haymarket square, and especially in the taverns, were gathered all sorts of craftsmen and ragpickers. raskolnikov loved these places primarily, just as he did all the nearest lanes, when he would walk the streets aimlessly. here his tattered clothes attracted no unwarranted attention and he could make his way in any apparel without creating a scandal. at konnyi lane, on the corner, stood a tradesman and his wife, a peasant woman, at two tables with wares they were selling: threads, braids, calico head scarves, and so on. they were also packing to go home, but lingered as they chatted with a passing acquaintance. this acquaintance was lizaveta ivanovna, or simply lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that very same old woman, alyona ivanovna, the widow of a collegiate registrar and moneylender, where raskolnikov had been the day before when he had gone to pawn his watch and conduct his test . . . . he had known everything about this lizaveta for some time now and was even slightly acquainted with her. she was a tall, awkward, timid, humble unmarried woman, almost feebleminded, thirty-five years old, living as a complete slave in her sister’s house, working for her day and night, trembling in her presence, even enduring beatings from her. she was standing deep in thought with a bundle in front of the tradesman and the peasant woman, listening to them attentively. they were explaining something to her with particular passion. when raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her, some sort of strange feeling, similar to deepest astonishment, seized him, even though there was nothing astonishing about the meeting. “you really should decide on your own, lizaveta ivanovna,” the tradesman was saying loudly. “come back tomorrow, around seven o’clock. they’ll be here, too.” “tomorrow?” lizaveta replied slowly and pensively, as if unable to make up her mind. “that alyona ivanovna’s really terrified you!” yammered the tradesman’s wife, a brash wench. “i look at you and see that you’re just like a little child. she’s not even your real sister, but your half sister, and she’s got you under her thumb.” “this time don’t say anything to alyona ivanovna,” her husband interrupted her. “that’s my advice. come see us without asking her. it’s a good deal. then your sister will figure it out, too.” “should i come?” “seven o’clock tomorrow; they’ll be here, too, and you’ll decide on your own.” “we’ll put up the samovar,” the wife added. “all right, i’ll come,” said lizaveta ivanovna, still pondering, and slowly started on her way. raskolnikov passed by just then and didn’t overhear any more. he walked by quietly, unnoticed, trying not to miss a single word. his initial amazement was gradually replaced by terror, as if a chill were running up and down his spine. he had found out, he had suddenly, abruptly, and completely unexpectedly found out that tomorrow, at precisely seven o’clock in the evening, lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and the only person who lived with her, would be away from home, and, as a result, the old woman, at precisely seven o’clock in the evening, would be at home alone. there were only a few paces left to his apartment. he entered like a person condemned to death. he wasn’t thinking about anything, nor could he even think; he suddenly felt with his entire being that he no longer possessed any freedom of thought or willpower, and that everything had been decided once and for all. of course, even if he’d had to wait years for a convenient opportunity, even then, having a plan, it would most likely"
dostoevsky,"have been impossible to reckon on a more apparent step toward fulfilling his plan than that which had suddenly been presented now. in any case, it would be difficult to discover the day before and for certain, with greater precision and the least amount of risk, without any dangerous inquiries or investigations, that tomorrow, at such and such a time, such and such an old woman, on whose life an attempt would be made, would be at home alone, absolutely alone. * st. petersburg is situated along the shores of the neva bay of the gulf of finland and on islands in the river delta. † the russian word is dobro , which means “property or goods” as well as “good” (as opposed to evil). oceanofpdf.com vi a fterward raskolnikov happened to learn somehow precisely why the tradesman and his wife had invited lizaveta to visit. the matter was most ordinary and didn’t involve anything unusual at all. an impoverished family that had recently arrived was selling some items, dresses and so on, all women’s goods. since it was unprofitable to sell them at the market, they were looking for a trader, and lizaveta engaged in that kind of commerce. she took a commission, went about on business, and had a large clientele because she was so honest and always set the best price: whatever price she stated, she stuck to it. in general she said very little and, as already indicated, she was very humble and timid . . . but lately raskolnikov had become superstitious. he retained traces of it for a long time afterward, almost indelibly. and in this entire affair he was always inclined subsequently to see some strangeness, as it were, some mystery, as though particular influences or coincidences were in evidence. last winter, pokorev, a student he knew, had been about to leave for kharkov and mentioned, in passing, the address of an old woman, alyona ivanovna, in case he needed to pawn something. he didn’t look her up for a long time because he was giving lessons and managing somehow. about a month and a half ago, he remembered her address; he had two items suitable for pawning: his father’s old silver watch and a small gold ring with three little red stones, given to him by his sister as a gift, a keepsake, at their parting. he decided to take the ring; after locating the old woman, right from the first glance, without knowing anything in particular about her, he conceived an insurmountable loathing for her; he received two “small notes” from her and on his way home dropped by a shabby little tavern. he ordered tea, sat down, and lapsed into deep thought. a strange idea had emerged in his head, like a baby chick pecking its way out of its egg, and it interested him greatly. at another table close to his sat a young officer and a student with whom he was not acquainted and whom he was unable to recall later. they had been playing billiards and were now drinking tea. all of a sudden he heard the student say something to the officer about the moneylender, alyona ivanovna, the widow of the collegiate registrar, and he mentioned her address to him. that alone seemed somehow strange to raskolnikov: he’d just come from there, and here they were talking about her. of course it was a coincidence, but he couldn’t shake off the extremely extraordinary impression, and now it seemed that someone was trying to nudge him in that direction: the student suddenly began telling his comrade various details about this alyona ivanovna. “she’s well known,” he said. “you can always get some money from her. she as rich as a yid, * can lend you five thousand just like that, but she doesn’t balk at taking a pledge worth a single ruble, either. many of our students have been to see her. but she’s an awful bitch . . .” he started describing how nasty she was, how willful, and said that if you were even one day late in redeeming your pledge, the item would be gone. she gives you four times less than the pledge is worth, he said, deducts five or even seven percent interest a month, so on and so forth. the student got carried away blabbing and, in addition, said that the old woman has a sister, lizaveta, whom she beats constantly and keeps totally enslaved, like a little child, even though she herself is small and vile, while lizaveta’s at least six feet tall . . . “she’s quite a phenomenon!” exclaimed the student and burst into laughter. they began talking about lizaveta. the student did so with some particular enjoyment and kept laughing, while the officer listened with great interest and asked the student to send this lizaveta around to him to mend some linen. raskolnikov didn’t utter a word during this conversation, yet he learned everything all at once: lizaveta was the old woman’s younger half sister (they had different mothers) and was already thirty-five years old. she worked for her sister day and night and served at home in place of a cook and a laundress; she also sewed to order, washed other people’s floors, and turned all the money over to her sister. she dared not accept any orders or work without the older woman’s permission. the old woman had already drawn up her will, which lizaveta herself knew, as well as the fact that she wouldn’t receive even half a kopeck, except for personal property, chairs, and so forth. all the money was to be left to a monastery in the novgorod province, for the eternal remembrance of her soul. lizaveta was a woman of the lower middle class, not like her sister, who had married an official; she was terribly unattractive, extremely tall, with long, large, apparently turned-out feet, always wore worn-out goatskin shoes, and kept herself neat and clean. the main thing, however, that"
dostoevsky,"astonished and amused the student was that lizaveta was continually pregnant . . . “but didn’t you say she’s a freak?” remarked the officer. “yes, so dark-skinned, as if she’s a disguised soldier, but you know, she’s not really a freak. she has such a kind face and eyes. even very kind. the proof is that many men find her attractive. she’s quiet, gentle, meek, and agreeable, agreeable to everything. she even has a very nice smile.” “i see that you fancy her, too, don’t you?” the officer asked with a laugh. “because of her strangeness. no, but here’s what i can tell you. i could kill and rob that cursed old woman, and can assure you, feel no pangs of conscience,” the student added passionately. the officer burst out laughing once again, but raskolnikov shuddered. this was so strange! “allow me to pose a serious question to you,” the student said, growing excited. “i was joking just now, of course, but look: on the one hand, here’s a stupid, mindless, worthless, spiteful, sick old hag, needed by no one—on the contrary, causing harm to everyone; she herself doesn’t know what she’s living for, and she’ll die of her own accord tomorrow. do you understand? do you?” “well, i do,” replied the officer, staring attentively at his impassioned comrade. “listen further. on the other hand, there are young, fresh forces, going to waste for lack of support, by the thousands, all over the place. a hundred, even a thousand good deeds and undertakings could be planned and performed with the old woman’s money that’s being left in her will to a monastery! hundreds, maybe thousands of beings could be set on the right path; dozens of families could be rescued from poverty, kept from dissolution, from ruin, debauchery, and venereal hospitals—all this with her wealth. murder her and take her money and then use it to dedicate yourself to the service of all humanity and to the common good: what do you think, wouldn’t thousands of good deeds make up for one little, tiny crime? thousands of lives saved from wrack and ruin—for one life? one death and a hundred lives in exchange—it’s a matter of arithmetic! what’s the life of that consumptive, stupid, spiteful old woman worth on the common scale? no more than that of a louse, a cockroach—not even that much, because the old woman’s harmful. she consumes other people’s lives: just the other day she bit lizaveta’s finger out of spite; they almost had to amputate!” “of course she doesn’t deserve to live,” observed the officer, “but that’s nature.” “hey, friend, nature can be rectified and directed; without that, one would drown in prejudices. without that, there wouldn’t be even one great man. they say, ‘duty, conscience.’ i don’t want to speak against duty and conscience—but how are we to understand them? wait, i’ll pose one more question to you. listen!” “no, you wait; i’ll pose a question to you. you listen!” “go on!” “now you’re ranting and raving, but tell me this: would you yourself kill the old woman or not?” “of course not! i’m talking about justice. . . . this has nothing to do with me . . .” “in my opinion, if you won’t dare to do it yourself, it’s not a matter of justice! let’s play another round!” raskolnikov was in a state of extreme agitation. of course, all this was the most ordinary, most common run of ideas and conversation of young people, the sort he had heard many times before in other forms and with other themes. but why precisely now did he happen to overhear just such a conversation and such ideas when in his own mind . . . exactly the same ideas had recently arisen? and why precisely at this moment, just as he was carrying the germ of this idea away from the old woman’s apartment, had he just happened upon this conversation about her? this coincidence always seemed strange to him. this insignificant conversation in the tavern had an extraordinary impact on him during the further development of this affair: it was as if it really was a premonition, a sign . . . after returning from the haymarket, he threw himself down on his sofa and sat there motionless for a whole hour. meanwhile, it grew dark; he didn’t have any candles, and it never even occurred to him to light one. he couldn’t recall a thing: was he really thinking about anything at that time? finally he felt the return of his recent fever and chills, and surmised with pleasure that he could also lie down on the sofa. soon a heavy, leaden sleep settled upon him, as if oppressing him. he slept for an unusually long time and had no dreams. nastasya, who came in at ten o’clock the next morning, roused him with difficulty. she brought him some tea and bread. the tea was weak once again and supplied in her own teapot. “look at him, he’s asleep!” she cried with indignation. “he’s constantly sleeping!” he raised himself up with effort. his head ached; he tried to stand up, turned around in his little room, and fell back down on the sofa. “going back to sleep!” nastasya cried. “are you ill, or what?” he made no reply. “want some tea?” “later,” he said with effort, closing his eyes once more and turning toward the wall. nastasya stood over him for a while. “maybe he really is ill,” she said, turned away, and left. she came in again at two o’clock with some soup. he was lying there just as before. the tea was untouched. nastasya was offended and began shaking him angrily. “still snoozing!” she cried, regarding him with disgust. he raised himself and sat up, but said nothing to her and looked at the floor. “are you sick or what?” nastasya asked and once again received no reply. “at least you ought to go outside,” she said after a"
dostoevsky,"brief pause, “and get some fresh air. are you going to eat something?” “later,” he said weakly. “go away!” he added, waving his arm. she stood there a little while longer, regarded him with compassion, and left the room. a few minutes later, he raised his head and stared at the tea and soup for a long time. then he picked up the bread, picked up a spoon, and started to eat. he ate a little, without much appetite, three or four spoonfuls, as if automatically. his head ached less. after this, he stretched out again on the sofa, but couldn’t fall asleep; he lay there without moving, facedown, buried in his pillow. he kept having daydreams, and they were very strange, indeed: most often he imagined that he was somewhere in africa, in egypt, on some sort of oasis. a caravan was taking a rest; camels were lying down peacefully; all around, palm trees grew in a complete circle; everyone was having dinner. he kept drinking water, right from the stream that was there beside him, flowing and murmuring. it was cool there and the water was so marvelously blue and cold, running over multicolored stones and over such pure, golden, glistening sand. . . . suddenly he heard a clock clearly chiming. he shuddered, came to, raised his head, looked out the window, guessed the time, and jumped up, having come to his senses completely, as if someone had torn him away from the sofa. he approached the door on tiptoe, opened it very quietly, and listened for any noise on the staircase below. his heart was pounding dreadfully. but all was quiet on the staircase, as if everyone was asleep. . . . it seemed reckless and bizarre that he could have been sleeping in such oblivion since yesterday, and that he hadn’t yet done anything, made any preparations. . . . meanwhile, perhaps the clock was chiming six o’clock. . . . an unusual, feverish, bewildering burst of activity suddenly overtook him, replacing his sleep and stupor. however, there wasn’t much preparation to be done. he made every effort to remember everything and forget nothing; his heart was still pounding, thumping so hard that it became hard for him to breathe. first, he had to make a loop and sew it into his coat—that would take only a minute or so. he groped under his pillow and found among the linen stuffed there an old, ragged, unwashed shirt. he tore off a strip from its tatters, about two inches wide and about fourteen inches long. he folded the strip in two, took off his loose, sturdy summer coat made out of a thick cotton material (it was his only outside coat), and began sewing both ends of the strip together under the left sleeve. his hands shook as he sewed, but he overcame that, so that nothing would be visible from the outside when he put his coat on again. he had long ago prepared a needle and thread, and they had lain wrapped in paper in the little table. as for the loop, that was his own very clever idea: it was designed to hold the axe. after all, he couldn’t walk along the street carrying an axe in his hands. and if he were to hide it under his coat, he’d still have to hold it with his hand, but that would be noticeable. now, with a loop, he merely had to insert the head of the axe and it could hang there comfortably, inside under his armpit, for the whole way there. if he put his hand into his side pocket, he could grasp the handle to make sure it didn’t swing; and since the coat was very loose, a genuine sack, the fact that he was keeping hold of it with the hand in his pocket wouldn’t be noticed from outside. he had conceived of this loop two weeks ago. after finishing his sewing, he thrust his fingers into a small opening between his “turkish” sofa and the floor, groped around inside the left corner, and pulled out the pledge he’d prepared long ago and hidden there. this pledge, however, wasn’t really a pledge at all, but simply a smoothly fashioned wooden block, no larger than a silver cigarette case in size and thickness. he’d come upon this block by chance on one of his walks, in a certain courtyard where a workshop was located in one wing of the building. then he’d added a smooth thin metal strip to the block, most likely broken off from something, which he’d also found on the street at the same time. after putting the two pieces together, the metal smaller than the wooden one, he’d tied them together with string, fastened tightly crosswise; then he’d wrapped them neatly and smartly in clean white paper and tied them with a thin ribbon, also crosswise, and made the knot so that it would be difficult to untie. this was done in order to divert the old woman’s attention for a while, since she would begin to struggle with the knot and thus he could seize the moment. the iron plate had been added to give the pledge weight, so that at first the old woman wouldn’t guess that the “object” was made of wood. all of this had been kept hidden under the sofa in his room until the right moment. suddenly, just as he’d picked up the pledge, he heard a voice coming from somewhere in the courtyard below shouting: “it’s way past six!” “way past! my god!” he rushed to the door, listened cautiously, grabbed his hat, and started down the thirteen steps, carefully, inaudibly, like a cat. the most important matter lay ahead—stealing an axe from the kitchen. he had long ago decided that he had to use an axe to do the deed. he also had a folding garden knife, but he couldn’t rely on a knife or, particularly, on his own"
dostoevsky,"strength; therefore, he had settled definitively on an axe. let us note, by the way, one peculiarity regarding all his definitive decisions already reached in this affair. they shared one strange trait: the more definitive they were, the more outrageous, the more absurd they immediately became in his own eyes. in spite of all his tormenting inner conflict, he never, even for one moment, could believe in the feasibility of his plans during all this time. and even if it sometimes happened that everything was understood and definitively resolved and that no further doubts remained—in that case, it seems, he would have renounced all of it as an absurdity, a monstrosity, and an impossibility. an enormous number of unresolved points and doubts still remained. as for where he could acquire an axe, that detail didn’t faze him in the least, since there was nothing easier. especially in the evenings, nastasya was frequently away from the house: either she ran off to the neighbors or to a shop, and the door was always left wide open. the landlady quarreled with her only about this oversight. and so, when the time came, all one had to do was enter the kitchen on the sly and grab the axe, then later, an hour later (when everything was finished), go in and put it back. but doubts still remained: let’s suppose he returned an hour later to put it back, but nastasya was also there. of course, he’d have to pass by and wait until she left again. what if during that time the axe was needed, she began looking for it, and started yelling—that would arouse suspicion or, at least, grounds for suspicion. but all of these were just trifles he hadn’t even begun to worry about, and there was no time to do so. he thought about the main point and put off the details until such time as he himself would be sure of everything . but that seemed decidedly unrealizable. at least, that was how he saw it. he couldn’t, for example, imagine that at some time he would stop thinking, get up, and—simply go there. . . . even his recent test (that is, his visit with the intention of definitively scoping out the place) had been no more than an attempt at a test, far from the real thing, merely: “let me go,” he says, “and attempt it; why just dream about it?” and right away he couldn’t stand it, spat in disgust, and ran away, furious with himself. meanwhile, it would seem, he had already completed his entire analysis, in the sense of resolving the question morally: his casuistry had been sharpened like a razor, and he himself could no longer find any conscious objections. in the last instance, he simply no longer trusted himself and stubbornly, slavishly, looked for objections everywhere, gropingly, as if someone were forcing him to do it and dragging him there. this last day, which had dawned so unexpectedly and resolved everything all at once, acted on him almost completely mechanically: it was as if someone took him by the hand and pulled him along behind, irresistibly, blindly, with unnatural strength, without resistance. it was exactly as if a corner of his clothes had become enmeshed in the cogwheel of a machine and it had begun to pull him in. from the beginning—or, rather, for a long time before—he’d been preoccupied by one question: why are almost all crimes so conspicuous, so easily discovered, and the traces of almost all criminals revealed so obviously? little by little he arrived at diverse and curious conclusions; in his opinion, the main reason was contained not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime, but in the criminal himself: the criminal himself, almost every one of them, at the very moment of the crime, is subject to some failure of willpower and reason, which are replaced, instead, by phenomenal childish thoughtlessness, precisely at the moment when reason and caution are most needed. according to his conviction, it turned out that this eclipse of reason and failure of willpower seize a person just like an illness, develop gradually, and reach their climax not long before the execution of the crime; they continue in the same form at the very moment of the crime and still for some time afterward, depending on the individual; then they pass away, as does any illness. the question remains: does the illness give birth to the crime itself, or is the crime, somehow by its own nature, always accompanied by something like an illness? he still felt it was beyond his power to resolve this question. after arriving at these conclusions, he decided that in his own case, in this affair, there could be no such morbid reversals, that he would retain his reason and his willpower, essentially, all during the implementation of his plan, for the sole reason that what he had planned—was “not really a crime . . .” we will omit the long process by which he arrived at this last conclusion; even without that, we have raced too far ahead. . . . we will merely add that in general the factual, purely material difficulties of this affair played a very secondary role in his mind. “one must simply exercise one’s willpower and all one’s reason over these difficulties, and they will all be overcome in their time, when one becomes familiar with all the details of this affair in all of its precision.” but the affair hadn’t begun. he continued to believe least of all in his final decisions, and when the time came, everything turned out differently, somehow unintentionally, almost unexpectedly. one extremely insignificant circumstance landed him in an impasse, even before he went down the stairs. having reached the landlady’s kitchen, its door wide open as usual, he carefully peeked in to have a look around beforehand: by any chance was the landlady herself in there during nastasya’s absence, and if not,"
dostoevsky,"was the door to her room firmly closed so that she couldn’t look out when he entered to take the axe? imagine his astonishment when he suddenly saw that not only was nastasya home this time, and in the kitchen, but that she was busy working: she was taking the laundry out of a basket and pinning it up to dry! seeing him, she stopped hanging the linens, turned to him, and regarded him all the while he was passing. he looked away and walked by, as if not noticing anything. but that spelled the end of the whole affair: he had no axe! he felt utterly defeated. “what on earth gave me the idea,” he wondered as he approached the entranceway, “what gave me the idea that she wouldn’t be home precisely at this moment? why, why, why did i decide this with such certainty?” he was crushed, even somehow humiliated. he felt like mocking himself spitefully. . . . he seethed with blind, brutal rage. he paused in the entryway to reflect. to set off along the street, just so, as if to take a stroll, just for appearance’s sake, was repulsive; to go back home was even more repulsive. “what an opportunity has been lost forever!” he muttered, standing aimlessly in the entrance, directly opposite the door to the caretaker’s small dark lodgings, also left open. all of a sudden he shuddered. from the caretaker’s room, only two paces away, under a bench on the right, something gleamed before his eyes. . . . he looked around cautiously—no one was there. he approached the lodge on tiptoes, went down two steps, and in a low voice called the caretaker. “just as i thought, he’s not home! he must be close by, however, in the courtyard, because the door’s wide open.” he rushed at the axe (it was an axe) and pulled it out from under the bench, where it had been lying between two logs; right there, before he left, he secured the axe in the loop, thrust both hands into his pockets, and left the lodge; no one noticed him! “if not by reason, then with the devil’s help,” he thought, chuckling strangely. this chance occurrence bolstered him enormously. he walked along the street quietly and steadily, without hurrying, so as not to arouse any suspicions. he didn’t look at any passersby, even trying not to glance into their faces at all, and to be as unnoticeable as possible. then he suddenly remembered his hat! “my god! i even had some money a few days ago and could have bought myself a cap!” a curse burst forth from his soul. glancing by chance with one eye into a shop, he noticed that there, on the wall clock, it was already ten minutes past seven. he needed to hurry and, at the same time, to make a detour: he wanted to approach the building in a roundabout way, from the other side . . . previously, when he had imagined all this, he’d sometimes thought he’d feel very afraid. but now he didn’t feel very afraid; in fact, he didn’t even feel afraid in the least. he was even preoccupied at the time by some extraneous thoughts, but not for very long. passing the yusupov garden, he was about to consider the idea of placing tall fountains there, thinking how well they would refresh the air in all the squares. little by little he came to the conviction that if the summer garden could be extended to include the entire field of mars and even connect it with the gardens at the mikhailovsky palace, that it would be a splendid and most useful thing for the city. then suddenly something caught his interest: why exactly was it that in all large cities people were somehow inclined to live and settle, not out of necessity alone, precisely in those parts of town where there were no gardens, no fountains, and where filth and stench prevailed, as well as all sorts of vileness. then he recalled his own strolls through the haymarket, and a moment later he came back to his senses. “what nonsense,” he thought. “no, it’s better not to think at all!” “that’s probably the way men being led to their execution slide into thinking about all the things they encounter along their way,” flashed through his mind, but it merely flashed, like a bolt of lightning; he himself extinguished this thought as quickly as possible. . . . now he was getting very close; here’s the house, here’s the gate. suddenly a clock struck once from somewhere. “what’s that? could it really be half past seven? it couldn’t be; the clock must be fast!” to his good fortune, once again he managed to get through the gates successfully. moreover, as if on purpose, at that very moment just before him a huge load of hay was entering the gate, completely shielding him while he was walking through the gateway; just as the cart was passing into the courtyard, he managed to slip in to its right. there, on the other side of the cart, he could hear several voices shouting and arguing. but no one had noticed him, and he didn’t happen to run into anyone. many windows looking out onto this huge square courtyard were open at this time, but he didn’t raise his head—he didn’t have the strength. the staircase leading to the old woman’s apartment was close by, just to the right of the gate. he was already on the first step . . . catching his breath and pressing his hand against his pounding heart, feeling and adjusting the axe again, he began climbing the stairs cautiously and quietly, constantly listening for any sounds. but this time the staircase was completely empty; all the doors were closed; he didn’t encounter anyone at all. however, on the second floor, the door to one empty apartment stood wide open and painters were working inside"
dostoevsky,"it, but they didn’t even notice him. he stood there a while, thought a bit, and walked on. “of course, it would be better if no one were here at all, but . . . there are two more floors above them.” but here’s the fourth floor, here’s the door, and here’s the apartment directly opposite; that one’s also empty. on the third floor, by all indications, the apartment right under the old woman’s was unoccupied as well: the nameplate, nailed to the door, had been removed—they must have moved away! he gasped for breath. for one moment, a thought flashed through his mind: “should i leave?” but he didn’t heed it and began listening at the door to the old woman’s apartment: dead silence. then he listened again for sounds on the staircase, listening attentively, for a long time. . . . then he glanced around for the last time, crept up to the door, straightened his clothes, and adjusted the axe in its loop again. “do i look pale . . . very pale?” he wondered. “am i much too agitated? she’s so mistrustful. . . . shouldn’t i wait a little longer . . . until my heart stops pounding?” but his heart didn’t stop. on the contrary, as if intentionally, it pounded even harder and harder and harder. . . . he couldn’t stand it anymore, stretched out his hand slowly, and rang the doorbell. a moment later he rang it again, louder. no answer. there was no reason to ring in vain, and it wasn’t in his nature. the old woman, of course, was at home, but she was suspicious and alone. he knew her habits in part . . . and once again he leaned his ear right against her door. whether his feelings were so attuned (which, in general, is hard to assume), or whether the sound really was audible, all of a sudden he detected what seemed like the cautious movement of a hand on the lock handle and what struck him as the rustle of clothes against the door. someone stood imperceptibly next to the lock and, precisely the way he was doing outside, was listening, hiding inside, apparently, also pressing one ear to the door . . . he shifted his position on purpose and muttered something a bit louder so as not to appear as if he were sneaking up; then he rang a third time, but softly, firmly, without any impatience. recalling it all later, plainly and clearly—this moment was etched in his mind forever—he couldn’t understand where he’d acquired so much cunning, all the more so since his mind seemed to cloud over at times, while he was hardly aware of his body. . . . a moment later he heard the bolt being thrown. * dostoevsky uses the derogatory term for jew ( zhid ), rather than the neutral word ( evrei ). oceanofpdf.com vii j ust as before, the door opened a little tiny crack; once again, two sharp, distrustful eyes stared out at him from the darkness. at this point raskolnikov became confused and was about to make a significant mistake. fearing that the old woman would get frightened that they would be all alone, and doubting that his appearance would reassure her, he grabbed the door and tugged it toward him so she wouldn’t feel the urge to pull it closed again. seeing this, she neither pulled the door back nor let go of the handle, the result being that he almost yanked her out onto the landing along with the door. seeing that she now stood blocking the doorway and wouldn’t let him pass, he advanced directly on her. she jumped back in fright, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak; she stared at him, her eyes open wide. “hello, alyona ivanovna,” he began as casually as possible, but his voice didn’t obey, broke off, and began trembling. “i’ve brought you . . . something . . . let’s go over there . . . to the light . . .” and, moving away from her, he entered the room directly, without invitation. the old woman ran in after him and recovered her powers of speech. “good lord! what’s all this? who are you? what do you want?” “for pity’s sake, alyona ivanovna . . . you know me . . . raskolnikov. . . . here, i’ve brought the pledge i promised a few days ago . . .” he handed her the packet. the old woman was about to examine the pledge, but instead stared directly into the eyes of her uninvited guest. she regarded him carefully, spitefully, and suspiciously. a minute passed; it even seemed as if her eyes reflected something like a smirk, as if she’d already guessed his whole plan. he felt that he was becoming confused, almost frightened, so frightened that if she kept staring at him like that without saying anything for another minute or so, he’d run away from her. “why are you looking at me like that, as if you don’t recognize me?” he asked suddenly, also with anger. “if you want it, take it; if not, i’ll go elsewhere; i don’t have much time.” he hadn’t planned to say this, but it was uttered just so, all by itself. the old woman came to her senses; her guest’s decisive tone, apparently, reassured her. “why are you in such a hurry, sir? what is it?” she asked, regarding the pledge. “a silver cigarette case. i told you last time.” she reached out her hand to take it. “but why are you so pale? even your hands are trembling! have you just come from the baths?” “it’s a fever,” he replied abruptly. “you grow pale, like it or not . . . if you don’t eat anything,” he added, barely able to utter the words. his strength was deserting him again. but his reply seemed credible; the old woman took the pledge."
dostoevsky,"“what is it?” she asked, staring at raskolnikov once again, weighing the pledge in her hand. “it’s an item . . . a cigarette case . . . silver. . . . have a look.” “but it doesn’t seem to be silver. . . . look at how tightly it’s wrapped.” trying to untie the knot and turning toward the light from the window (all of her windows were locked, in spite of the stuffiness), she left him alone for a few seconds and stood with her back to him. he unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from its loop but didn’t remove it yet, merely keeping hold of it with his right hand under his coat. his hands were terribly weak; he felt how with each moment they grew number and more wooden. he was afraid that he might let go of the axe and drop it . . . all of a sudden, his head seemed to be spinning. “you certainly wrapped it tightly!” cried the old woman in annoyance, moving back in his direction. there was not a moment to spare. he withdrew the axe completely, raised it with both his arms, hardly aware of himself, and almost with no effort, almost mechanically, brought the butt end down onto her head. it was as if he had no strength. but as soon as he let the axe fall once, he felt a new strength in himself. the old woman was bareheaded, as always. her light-colored hair, sparse and with gray patches, smeared generously with grease as usual, was braided into a thin pigtail tucked under a comb of horn that stuck out at the nape of her neck. as a result of her small size, the blow came down on the crown of her head. she cried out, but very weakly, and suddenly collapsed completely onto the floor, although she’d managed to raise both hands to her head. in one she kept hold of the “pledge.” then he struck her a second time and a third with all his might, still using the butt of the axe and hitting her crown. blood gushed forth as if from an overturned glass, and her body tumbled backward. he stepped away, let her fall, and then bent down to peer into her face; she was already dead. her eyes were wide open as if they wanted to jump out, and her forehead and entire face were wrinkled and distorted by a spasm. he placed the axe on the floor next to the dead woman and immediately reached into her pocket, trying not to get covered with her spurting blood—into that same right pocket from which she’d taken her keys the last time. he was in full possession of his faculties; there was no dizziness or blackout, but his hands were still shaking. he remembered afterward that he was very focused, careful, trying hard not to get smeared. . . . he pulled out the keys right away; as before, they were all in one bunch, on one steel ring. he ran into the bedroom at once. it was a very small room with an enormous glass case filled with icons. a large bed stood against the opposite wall, extremely tidy, covered by a silk patchwork quilt. there was a dresser against the third wall. it was odd: as soon as he tried to select a key to the dresser, as soon as he heard the jingling, a shudder seemed to pass through him. he suddenly wanted to abandon the whole thing again and escape. but this feeling lasted for only a moment; it was too late to leave. he even chuckled to himself, as another distressing idea suddenly rushed into his head. all of a sudden it seemed to him that the old woman might still be alive and might revive. tossing away the keys and leaving the dresser, he ran back to the body, grabbed the axe, and brandished it once again over the old woman, but he didn’t lower it. there was no doubt that she was dead. bending down and peering at her once more, he saw clearly that her skull was broken and even dislodged slightly to one side. he wanted to insert his fingers to feel it, but pulled his hand back; it was obvious even without that. meanwhile, a large pool of blood had formed. suddenly he noticed a cord around her neck; he pulled it, but the cord was strong and didn’t break; besides, it was soaked in blood. he tried to yank it from her chest, but something got in the way, and it wouldn’t budge. in his impatience, he was about to swing the axe again to break the cord right there, on her body, from above, but he didn’t dare; with difficulty, soiling both his hands and the axe, after a struggle lasting a few moments, he used the axe to break the cord without touching the body and removed it; he wasn’t mistaken—it held a purse. there were two crosses hanging from the cord, one made of cypress and the other of copper and, in addition, a small enameled icon; there, together with them, hung a small greasy suede purse with a steel frame and clasp. the purse was crammed full; raskolnikov stuffed it into his pocket without examining it and tossed the crosses back onto the old woman’s chest; this time he also grabbed the axe and rushed back into the bedroom. he seized the keys in a terrible hurry and once more began fiddling with them. but somehow he failed to open the dresser: none of the keys fit the locks. it wasn’t that his hands were trembling so much, but he kept making mistakes: he would see, for example, that a key wasn’t the right one, it didn’t work, but he kept on trying it. suddenly he recalled and realized that there was one large key with a big tooth, together with the other smaller"
dostoevsky,"keys, and that it certainly wouldn’t fit the dresser (this thought had occurred to him last time), but, rather, would belong to some small trunk or chest in which everything might be hidden. he abandoned the dresser and immediately crawled under the bed, knowing that old women usually store chests under their beds. it was just as he thought: there was a good-sized chest, more than two feet long, with a rounded top, covered in red leather, decorated with small steel tacks. the key with the big tooth was exactly the right one and opened the chest. on top, under a white cloth, lay a rabbit-fur coat, trimmed with red silk; underneath was a silk dress, then a shawl; deeper inside, there appeared to be only clothes. first of all, he began to wipe his bloodstained hands on the red trim. “red blood will be less noticeable on red silk,” he thought and suddenly came to his senses: “lord! am i losing my mind, or something?” he thought in fright. but as soon as he’d touched the clothes, a gold watch slipped out from under the fur coat. he set about rifling through everything inside. in fact, among all the clothes were various gold items—probably all pledges, redeemed and unredeemed: bracelets, chains, earrings, pins, and so forth. some were in cases, others simply wrapped in newspaper, neatly and carefully, in double sheets, bound with ribbons. without the least delay, he began stuffing them into the pockets of his trousers and coat without sorting them or opening the wrapping or the cases; but he didn’t manage to get very far . . . suddenly he heard someone moving in the room where the old woman’s body lay. he paused and fell silent as a corpse. but everything was quiet; of course, he must have only imagined it. all of a sudden he heard a feeble cry, as if someone was emitting quiet and intermittent moans, which then subsided. deadly silence prevailed again for a minute or two. he was squatting down next to the chest and waiting, hardly drawing a breath; but suddenly he jumped up, grabbed the axe, and ran out of the bedroom. in the middle of the room stood lizaveta, holding a large bundle; she was staring in a stupor at her murdered sister, looking white as a sheet, as if lacking the strength to scream. seeing him come running out of the bedroom, she began trembling like a leaf, a gentle trembling, and shudders ran across her entire face; she raised one arm, was about to open her mouth, but still didn’t cry out; she began slowly backing away from him into the corner, eyes fixed on him, but still not screaming, as if she didn’t have enough breath to scream. he rushed at her with the axe; her lips became so desperately distorted, just like those of little children when they begin to feel frightened of someone, staring at the thing that frightens them, getting ready to cry. this unfortunate lizaveta was so simple, so helpless, and so terrified once and for all, that she didn’t even raise her arms to protect her face, although that would have been the most necessary and natural gesture at that moment, because the axe was raised right above her face. she merely lifted her free left arm ever so slightly, nowhere near her face, and slowly extended it toward him, as if pushing him away. the blow struck her right on the skull, with the blade of the axe, and immediately hacked through the entire upper part of her forehead, almost to her crown. she collapsed onto the floor at once. raskolnikov was about to panic; he grabbed her bundle, threw it down again, and ran into the entranceway. fear was overcoming him more and more, especially after this second, completely unanticipated murder. he wanted to run away as quickly as possible. if, at that moment, he had been in a condition to see and reason more clearly, if he could only have realized the difficulties of his position, all the desperation, all the hideousness, all the absurdity of it, and have understood how many complications, perhaps even outrages, he would still have to commit and surmount in order to escape and reach his home, it’s very possible that he’d have given it all up and proceeded immediately to turn himself in, not because he feared for himself, but just as a result of his horror and disgust at what he’d done. his feeling of disgust, especially, grew with every passing moment. not for anything in the world would he have gone back now to the chest or even entered that room. but some sort of absentmindedness, as it were, even pensiveness, gradually began to overwhelm him; for a few moments he seemed even to fall into oblivion, or, more accurately, he kept forgetting the main point of the affair and focusing on details. but then, glancing into the kitchen and catching sight of a bucket half full of water sitting on a bench, he decided to rinse off his hands and the axe. his hands were covered with blood and sticky. he lowered the axe blade into the water, grabbed a piece of soap from a chipped saucer sitting on the windowsill, and began washing his hands right in the bucket. after doing so, he pulled out the axe, wiped off the iron blade, and for a long time, almost three minutes, scrubbed the wooden handle where it was covered in blood, even using soap to wash it away. then he wiped everything with some laundry that was drying on a rope stretched across the kitchen; then, for a long time, he stood next to the window and with great attention examined the axe. there were no traces of blood left on it, but the wood was still damp. he carefully replaced the axe in its loop under his coat. then, making use of the limited light in"
dostoevsky,"the dark kitchen, he inspected his coat, trousers, and boots. at first glance, there appeared to be nothing wrong: only a few spots of blood on his boots. he soaked a rag and wiped them off. he knew, however, that he was unable to see very well; perhaps there was something he hadn’t noticed that might strike someone. he stood in the middle of the room, deep in thought. a tormenting, dark idea arose in him—the idea that he was behaving like a madman and that at this moment he was no longer able to reason or defend himself, and that perhaps it was totally unnecessary to do what he was doing now. . . . “my god! i must get away, run away!” he muttered and rushed into the entrance hall. but there such a terror awaited him—one, of course, that he’d never experienced before. he stood there, stared, and didn’t believe his eyes: the door, the outer door from the entrance hall onto the landing, the one he’d rung and entered not that long ago, stood open, open as wide as his hand: no lock, no bolt, all the time, during all this time! the old woman hadn’t locked it after him, perhaps out of caution. but, by god! then he’d seen lizaveta! how, how on earth could he have failed to guess that she’d come from somewhere! she hadn’t come through the wall. he rushed to the door and threw the bolt. “but no, that’s not right either! i must leave, leave . . .” he undid the bolt, opened the door, and listened on the staircase. he stood there, listening, for a long time. somewhere far off, down below, probably near the gates, two voices could be heard shouting loudly and shrilly, arguing and quarreling. “what are they doing?” he waited patiently. at last everything quieted down all at once, as if cut off; the men departed. he was about to leave, but all of a sudden a door one floor below opened noisily onto the landing, and someone started down the stairs, humming a tune. “they’re making so much noise!” flashed through his head. he closed the door behind himself again and waited a little while. at last everything became still; there wasn’t a soul. he was about to start down the stairs when suddenly he heard footsteps again. the steps were very far off, at the bottom of the stairs, but he later recalled very clearly and distinctly that from the first sound, for some reason or other, he began to suspect that the footsteps were definitely coming here, that is, up to the fourth floor, to the old woman. why? were the sounds so special, so noteworthy, or what? the steps were heavy, even, unhurried. now he had passed the first floor and kept on climbing; the steps were becoming more and more audible! he could hear a man’s serious shortness of breath. he was approaching the third floor. . . . he was coming here! all of a sudden raskolnikov felt paralyzed, as if he were asleep, dreaming that he was being chased; they were getting closer, wanting to kill him, while he was rooted to the spot and unable even to move his arms. at last, when the visitor began climbing up to the fourth floor, only then did raskolnikov suddenly shudder and manage to slip swiftly and nimbly back from the landing into the apartment and close the door behind himself. then he grabbed the bolt and quietly, inaudibly slid it into place. instinct helped him. after he did all this, he stood still without breathing, on the other side of the door. the unwelcome guest was already standing at the door, too. now they stood on opposite sides, just as he had before with the old woman when the door had separated them, and he listened very carefully. the visitor drew several deep breaths. “he must be large and heavy,” thought raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. as a matter of fact, it was all happening just like in a dream. the guest reached for the bell and pulled it firmly. as soon as the tinny sound of the bell jingled, it suddenly seemed to him that there was some movement inside the room. for a few seconds he even listened in earnest. the stranger rang again, waited a while, and then suddenly, in his impatience, began tugging at the door handle with all his might. raskolnikov stared in horror as the bolt jiggled in its latch, and he waited with dull fear for the bolt to pop out. in fact, that seemed very possible, the tugging was so violent. he quickly thought about holding the bolt with his hand, but then he would guess what was happening. his head was beginning to spin again. “i’m going to fall!” flashed into his mind, but the stranger began speaking, and raskolnikov came to his senses immediately. “what the hell are they doing in there? are they dead to the world or did someone strangle them? goddamn them!” he bellowed as if from a barrel. “hey, alyona ivanovna, you old witch! lizaveta ivanovna, you indescribable beauty! open up! hey, goddammit, are you asleep or what?” once again, in a rage, he pulled the bell with all his might a dozen or more times. he was, clearly, a commanding presence and very familiar with this place. suddenly, at that very moment, some light, hurried footsteps could be heard not far away on the stairs. someone else was approaching. raskolnikov hadn’t managed to discern that at first. “isn’t anyone there?” cried the man distinctly and cheerfully, directly addressing the first visitor, who was still continuing to pull the doorbell. “hello, kokh!” “judging by his voice, he must be very young,” raskolnikov reflected suddenly. “the devil only knows. i’ve almost broken the lock,” replied kokh. “and how does it happen that you know my name?” “what do you mean? we met three days"
dostoevsky,"ago at the gambrinus tavern; i beat you in three rounds of billiards!” “ahhh . . .” “so they aren’t in there? that’s strange. rather, it’s terribly stupid. where could the old woman go? i’ve got business to do.” “so do i, my friend.” “well, what’s to be done? that’s it, i guess. damn! i hoped to get some cash!” cried the young man. “that’s it, of course. why agree on a meeting? that witch, she set the time herself. i even made a detour. where in hell could she go gallivanting, i don’t understand. the old witch stays at home all year, mopes around, her feet ache, and now, all of a sudden, she picks up and goes out for a stroll!” “maybe we should ask the caretaker?” “what?” “where they went and when they’ll be back?” “hmm . . . what the hell . . . we’ll ask. but she doesn’t go anywhere . . .” he tried the door handle again. “damn, there’s nothing to be done—let’s go!” “wait!” the young man cried suddenly. “look: you see how the door gives a bit when you pull at it?” “so?” “that means it’s not locked, only fastened, i mean bolted! do you hear how the bolt rattles?” “so?” “why don’t you understand? that means someone’s at home. if they’d both left, the door would have been locked with a key from the outside, and not with the bolt from inside. listen—do you hear how the bolt rattles? to fasten it from inside, someone has to be at home, do you understand? in other words, they’re home, just not opening the door.” “ah! indeed!” cried the astonished kokh. “so they’re really in there!” he began rattling the door violently. “wait!” cried the young man again. “don’t yank it! something’s not right about it. you rang the bell, pulled it, but they didn’t open; that means they’ve either both fainted, or else . . .” “what?” “here’s what: let’s go find the caretaker; let him rouse them.” “right!” they both started downstairs. “wait! you stay here while i run down for the caretaker.” “why should i stay?” “who knows what might happen?” “all right . . .” “i’m preparing to become an examining magistrate! * it’s obvious, ob-vi-ous that something’s not right here,” cried the young man, and he set off down the stairs at a run. kokh remained there, gently rang the bell again, which jingled only once; then, as if reflecting and examining, he tried the door handle again, moving it up and down, to convince himself once more that it was latched by only the bolt. then, puffing, he bent over and began peering into the keyhole; but the key had been inserted from inside, and therefore nothing was visible. raskolnikov stood there clutching his axe. he seemed to be in a stupor. he was even ready to fight with them if they entered the room. while they were knocking and talking, the idea occurred to him several times of ending it all and calling out to them from his side of the door. at times he wanted to begin swearing at them, taunting them, until they managed to force the door open. “hurry up!” flashed through his mind. “what’s happened to him, damn it . . .” time was passing, one minute, then another—no one came. kokh began to stir. “damn it all!” he cried suddenly and impatiently; abandoning his lookout; he, too, headed down, hastening, his boots pounding on the stairs. his footsteps receded. “lord, what should i do?” raskolnikov slid the bolt and opened the door—he heard nothing; all of a sudden, completely without thinking, he went out, closed the door behind himself as tightly as he could, and headed downstairs. he had already descended three floors when he suddenly heard a loud noise below—where could he go? there was nowhere to hide. he started to run back upstairs, toward the apartment. “hey, damn it, you devil! wait!” someone shouted from one of the apartments below and didn’t exactly run but seemed, rather, to catapult down the stairs, shouting as loudly as he could: “mitka! mitka! mitka! mitka! mitka! the devil take you!” the shout ended with a shriek; the last sounds could be heard from outside in the courtyard; then everything fell silent. but just at that same moment several people, talking loudly and quickly, began climbing the stairs noisily. there were three or four of them. he heard the clear voice of the young man: “it’s them!” in complete despair, he headed back downstairs to confront them: come what may! if they stop him, all’s lost; if they let him pass, all’s still lost: they’ll remember him. they were about to meet; only one floor separated them—then, all of sudden, deliverance! on the right, just a few steps away from him, was the empty apartment, its door wide open, the one on the second floor in which the painters had been working, and now, as if intentionally, they had left. they must be the men who’d just run out with so much shouting. the floors had just been painted; in the middle of the room stood a small tub, a crock of paint, and a brush. in a flash, he ducked through the open doorway and concealed himself behind a door, just in time: they were now standing on the same landing. then they turned and went up to the fourth floor, conversing loudly. he waited, tiptoed out, and ran downstairs. there was no one on the staircase! nor in the gateway. he passed through it and turned left, onto the street. he knew very well, he knew extremely well, that at this very moment, they were already in the apartment; they were astonished at seeing it unlocked, when it had been locked just before; they were already staring at the bodies; no more than a minute would pass before they would begin to conjecture and realize that the murderer had just"
dostoevsky,"been there and had managed to hide somewhere, slip past them, and escape; perhaps they would guess that he had stopped in the open apartment while they were making their way upstairs. meanwhile, under no pretext did he dare increase his pace significantly, although there remained about a hundred steps to the first turn. “shouldn’t i slip into some gateway and wait there in an unfamiliar staircase? no, bad idea! should i get rid of the axe? should i take a cab? bad idea, very bad!” finally he reached a narrow street; half dead, he turned into it; here he was somewhat safe and understood this: there would be less suspicion, a crowd of people scurrying about, and he would blend into it like a grain of sand. but all of these torments had rendered him so weak that he could scarcely move. drops of sweat poured off him; his neck was entirely soaked. “drunk as a skunk!” someone shouted at him when he came out to the canal. he was now beside himself; the farther he went, the worse he felt. he remembered, however, that as soon as he’d emerged along the canal, he’d grown afraid that there were so few people that he’d be more noticeable, so he wanted to turn back into the narrow street. in spite of the fact that he was almost collapsing, he managed to make a detour and approach his house from the opposite side. he was not in complete control of his faculties when he turned into the gate of his own building; at any rate, only when he’d already reached the staircase did he remember about the axe. for the moment, there remained a very important problem: to return the axe to its place, attracting as little attention as possible. of course, he was no longer able to realize that it might be much better not to put it back at all in its former place, but to toss it away, though somewhat later, into some other courtyard. everything, however, turned out all right. the door to the caretaker’s lodge was closed but not locked; therefore, he was probably at home. though even before that he’d already lost the ability to conceive of something else, so he went straight up to the door of the lodge and opened it. if the caretaker had asked, “what do you want?,” perhaps he would have handed over the axe straight away. but once again the caretaker wasn’t there, and he managed to return it to its previous place under the bench; he even covered it with a log as before. after that he met no one, not a single soul, on his way up to his room; the landlady’s door was closed and locked. entering his own room, he threw himself down on his sofa just as he was. he didn’t sleep, but lay there in a trance. if someone had come into his room then, he would have jumped up and started shouting. shreds and fragments of thoughts swarmed in his head; but he couldn’t seize on any of them, couldn’t focus on any of them, in spite of all his efforts . . . * a new position in the russian civil service created by the legal reforms of , to carry out investigations into allegations of criminality. oceanofpdf.com i h e lay there for a long time. periodically he would seem to awaken and notice that it was already dark, but it never occurred to him to get up. at last he noticed that it had grown as light as day. he lay there on his sofa facedown, still dazed from his recent stupor. terrible, desperate, shrill shrieks reached him from the street, sounds he heard every night under his window sometime after two in the morning. that was what woke him now as well. “ah! drunks are leaving the taverns,” he thought. “it’s after two o’clock.” suddenly he jumped as if someone had torn him from the sofa. “what! already after two!” he sat up on the sofa—and then remembered everything. all at once he recalled it all in one moment. at first he thought he would lose his mind. a terrible feeling of coldness seized him; but that was also a result of the fever that had begun long before, while he was still asleep. now he suddenly felt such a chill that his teeth began chattering violently; he started shaking all over. he opened the door and listened: everything was absolutely still in the house. he looked himself over in astonishment and then surveyed everything else in his room and couldn’t understand how he could have come in yesterday and failed to secure his own door with the bolt and how he had thrown himself down on his sofa not only without undressing, but even without removing his hat: it had fallen off and lay there on the floor next to his pillow. “if someone had come in, what would he have thought? that i was drunk, but . . .” he rushed to the little window. there was sufficient light, and he began examining himself hastily, all over, from head to toe, all of his clothes: were there perhaps any traces? but it was impossible; still trembling from his chill, he began taking everything off and examining it again. he turned everything over, to the last thread and shred; not trusting himself, he repeated the inspection several times. but there was nothing to see; it seemed that there were no traces. only where his trousers were frayed and the fringe hung down did there remain some thick spots of dried blood. he grabbed his large pocketknife and cut off the fringe. there seemed to be nothing else. he suddenly recalled that the purse and the items he’d taken from the old woman’s chest were still in his pockets! up to this point, he hadn’t even thought about taking them out and hiding them! he hadn’t even thought"
dostoevsky,"about them just now as he was inspecting his clothes! why not? in an instant, he rushed to take the items out and toss them onto the table. after removing everything, even turning his pockets inside out to make sure nothing was left, he carried the whole pile over to the corner of his room. there, down below, was a spot where the wallpaper had been torn away from the wall. he immediately began stuffing everything into this hole underneath the torn wallpaper. “it fits! everything’s out of sight—the purse, too!” he thought elatedly, standing up and regarding the corner foolishly, looking at the hole where the wallpaper now bulged even more than before. suddenly he shuddered all over in horror. “my god,” he whispered in despair, “what’s the matter with me? is it really concealed? is this how one hides things?” true, he hadn’t counted on having any items; he’d thought there would be only cash, and therefore he hadn’t prepared a hiding place. “but now, am i happy now?” he wondered. “is this how one hides things? i’m really losing my mind!” he sat down on his sofa in exhaustion, and right away an unbearable chill took hold of him again. he automatically grabbed his winter coat, the one he’d worn as a student; it was lying next to him on a chair and was warm, but already almost in tatters. he covered himself with it; sleep and delirium overcame him at once. he sank into semiconsciousness. not more than five minutes later he jumped up again and, all at once, in a frenzy, flung himself at his clothes again. “how could i fall back to sleep when nothing’s been done? so it is, so it is: i haven’t even removed the loop under my arm! i forgot, i forgot all about it! what a piece of evidence!” he ripped out the loop and quickly began tearing it to pieces, stuffing them under his pillow with his linen. “shreds of torn canvas won’t arouse any suspicion; so it seems, so it seems!” he repeated, standing in the middle of the room, and with painfully strained attention he began glancing around again, at the floor and everywhere else, to see if he might have forgotten something. the certainty that everything, even his memory, even his basic understanding, was deserting him was starting to torment him unbearably. “what, is it really starting, is this the punishment beginning? so that’s it, that’s what it is!” in fact, shreds of the fringe he had cut off his trousers were lying there on the floor in the middle of the room, so that the first person who came in would notice them! “what’s happening to me?” he cried out once again, like a lost soul. then a strange thought occurred to him: perhaps all of his clothes were bloodstained, perhaps there were many spots, and he merely didn’t see them, didn’t notice them because his reason had been weakened, shattered . . . his mind darkened. . . . suddenly he recalled that there was also blood on the purse. “bah! so there must also be blood in my pocket, because i shoved the damp purse into it!” he turned his pocket inside out in an instant and—so it was—there were spots, traces of blood on the pocket lining! “my reason must not have deserted me entirely; i must still have my ability to reason and my memory, if i remembered and figured that out myself!” he thought elatedly, taking a deep, joyful breath of air. “it’s simply feverish weakness, momentary delirium,” he decided and he tore out the whole lining of his left trouser pocket. at that moment, a ray of sunlight lit up his left boot: on his sock, which stuck out, there seemed to be more spots. he shook his boot off his foot. “it’s really true! the whole end of my sock is soaked through with blood.” he must have stepped carelessly into that puddle then . . . “what can i do with it now? where could i stash the sock, the fringe, the lining?” he gathered everything up in his hands and stood in the middle of the room. “into the stove? but they’ll begin looking there first. burn it? with what? i don’t even have any matches. no, it’s better to go throw it all away somewhere. yes! better to throw it all away!” he repeated, sitting back down on the sofa. “and right now, this very minute, without delay!” but instead of that, his head slid down onto the pillow again; an unbearable chill rendered him numb once more; he pulled his coat over himself again. for several long hours he kept imagining in fits that “right now, without putting it off, he must go somewhere and throw it all away, get rid of it, at once, as soon as possible!” several times he wanted to tear himself away from the sofa, tried to stand up, but couldn’t. at long last, a firm knock on the door roused him. “open up. are you alive or not? still dead asleep!” cried nastasya, banging on the door with her fist. “he sleeps for days at a time, just like a mutt! what a mutt you are! open up, will you? it’s past ten.” “maybe he’s not home,” said a male voice. “bah! it’s the caretaker. . . . what does he want?” raskolnikov wondered. he jumped up and sat on the sofa. his heart was pounding so hard that it was aching. “then who fastened the hook?” nastasya retorted, “see, he’s started locking the door! you think they’ll come and steal you away? open up, you thinker, you, wake up!” “what do they want? why’s the caretaker here? it’s all clear. resist or open the door? to hell with it!” he stretched forward, leaned over, and raised the hook. his room was so small that he could undo the hook without even getting out of bed. just"
dostoevsky,"as he thought: the caretaker and nastasya were standing there. nastasya looked him over somewhat strangely. he cast a challenging and desperate glance at the caretaker, who silently handed him a gray piece of paper folded in two, sealed with bottle wax. “it’s a notice, from the office,” he said, handing him the paper. “from what office?” “the police. you’re being summoned to their office. it’s clear what office it is.” “the police? what for?” “how should i know? they demand it, so you go.” he looked at him carefully, glanced all around, and turned to go. “are you really ill?” nastasya asked, without taking her eyes off him. the caretaker also turned his head to look for a minute. “he’s had a fever since yesterday,” she added. raskolnikov made no reply and held the paper in his hands without opening it. “you’d better not get up,” nastasya continued, feeling sorry for him and seeing that he was lowering his legs from the sofa. “if you’re sick, then don’t go; it’ll wait. what’s that in your hands?” he looked down: in his right hand he held the torn scraps of lining, the sock, and the tatters of his torn-out pocket. he had slept with them in his hand. later on, thinking about it, he remembered that and, half-awakening with his fever, clasped it all tightly in his hand and dozed off once again. “just look, he’s gathered some rags and is sleeping with them, as if they were a treasure,” nastasya said, then went off into fits of painfully nervous laughter. in an instant, he shoved everything under his coat and fixed his eyes on her. even though at that moment he could understand very little, he still felt that if the police were coming to arrest him, they wouldn’t be treating him like this. “but . . . the police?” “would you like some tea? yes or no? i’ll bring you some; there’s some left . . .” “no . . . i’ll go; i’ll go right now,” he muttered, getting up. “you’ll go, will you, but will you make it down the stairs?” “i’ll go . . .” “do as you like.” she left, following the caretaker. he rushed toward the light to examine his sock and the fringe: “there are some spots, but they’re not too conspicuous; everything’s so dirty, worn out, and faded. if someone didn’t know about it beforehand—he wouldn’t notice a thing. nastasya couldn’t see anything from a distance, thank god!” then he opened the notice with trepidation and began reading; he read for a long time and finally understood. it was an ordinary summons from the local police to appear that very day at half past nine at the district superintendent’s office. “when has this ever happened before? i have no dealings with the police at all! and why exactly today?” he wondered in painful confusion. “oh, lord, let it end soon!” he was about to throw himself onto his knees to pray, but then he started laughing, not at the idea of prayer, but at himself. he began dressing hurriedly. a thought suddenly occurred to him: “if i’m done for, then so be it, it doesn’t matter! i’ll put on my sock! it’ll get dirty in the dust, and the traces will vanish.” but as soon as he put it on, he tore it off in disgust and horror. when he realized that he had no other sock, he put it back on again—and started laughing once more. “all this is so ordinary, it’s all relative, all purely form.” that thought occurred to him just in passing, merely at the far edge of his mind, while his entire body was trembling. “but i did put it on! all the same, i put it on!” his laughter, however, was immediately replaced by despair. “no, this is more than i can bear,” he thought. his legs were shaky—“out of fear,” he muttered to himself. his head was spinning and aching from the fever. “it’s a trick! they want to entrap me with their guile and then, all of a sudden, throw me off guard,” he continued muttering to himself as he headed out onto the stairs. “the bad thing is that i’m almost delirious. . . . i might utter some stupid lie . . .” on the stairs, he remembered that he was leaving all those things just as they were in the hole behind the wallpaper. “what if they come on purpose to search the place while i’m out,” he wondered, hesitating. but such despair and such a cynical view of his demise, if one could call it that, suddenly overcame him, and he waved his arm with indifference and carried on. “if only it would end soon!” once again it was unbearably hot outside: if only there’d been a drop or two of rain these last few days. again dust, bricks, and plaster, again the stench of shops and taverns, again the constant drunks, the finnish peddlers, and the run-down cabs. the sun shone so brightly in his eyes that it was painful for him to see and he felt very dizzy—the usual sensation of a feverish person who suddenly comes outside into the blinding sunshine. reaching the turn into yesterday’s street, he glanced with tormenting agitation, at that house . . . and immediately turned away. “if they ask, perhaps i’ll even tell them,” he thought as he approached the police station. the office was about three hundred yards from his house. they had just moved into a new place, a new building, on the fourth floor. he had been to the former location once briefly, but a long time ago. entering the gates, he saw a staircase on the right, where a peasant was coming down with a registration book in hand: “he must be a caretaker, so the office must be in here.” he started up the stairs on this hunch. he didn’t want to ask anyone about"
dostoevsky,"anything. “i’ll go in, fall on my knees, and tell them everything,” he thought as he reached the fourth floor. the staircase was narrow, steep, and covered in dirty dishwater. the kitchens of all the apartments on all four floors opened onto this staircase and remained open almost all day long. as a result, it was terribly stuffy. caretakers with registration books under their arms filed up and down the stairs, as well as police messengers and various people of both sexes—visitors. the door to the office itself was also wide open. he entered and stood in the vestibule. some peasants were waiting inside. the stuffiness there was also extreme; in addition, there was a nauseating smell of fresh paint, not yet dry, that had been mixed with rancid oil and used to repaint the walls. after waiting a little while, he decided to advance into the next room. the rooms were all tiny and had low ceilings. terrible impatience pulled him farther and farther in. no one took any notice of him. some clerks were sitting and writing in the second room, dressed only a little bit better than he was, and they were all strange-looking. he turned to one of them. “what do you want here?” he showed the summons he’d received from the office. “are you a student?” asked the man who’d glanced at the paper. “a former student, yes.” the clerk looked him over, but without any curiosity. he was a particularly disheveled fellow with a steadfast look in his eyes. “i won’t learn anything from this fellow because he doesn’t care in the least,” thought raskolnikov. “go over there, to the head clerk,” he said and directed him to the last room. he entered that room (the fourth in the row); it was cramped and crowded with people—they were dressed a little more neatly than those in the other rooms. there were two ladies among the callers. one was in mourning attire, poorly dressed, sitting at the table opposite the head clerk and writing down something he was dictating. the other lady, very plump, had a dark red complexion with spots; a distinguished woman, very elegantly attired, with a brooch the size of a saucer on her bosom, she stood off to one side, waiting. raskolnikov thrust his summons at the head clerk. he looked at it fleetingly and said, “wait,” and continued to deal with the lady in mourning. raskolnikov breathed more easily. “it can’t be that!” little by little he began to feel calmer; he used all his strength to urge himself to cheer up and gather his thoughts. “some stupid thing, some very insignificant oversight, and i might have given myself away! hmm . . . it’s a pity there’s no air in here,” he added. “it’s so stuffy. . . . my head’s spinning even more . . . and my mind, too . . .” he felt a terrible, sweeping sense of disorder. he was afraid of losing his self-control. he tried to grab hold of something and focus on it, something completely marginal, but he was unable to do so. the head clerk, however, interested him greatly: he tried to guess something about him from his face, to penetrate to his core. he was a very young man, about twenty-two, with a dark complexion and a lively countenance, seemingly older than his years, dressed fashionably like a dandy, his hair parted to the back of his head, well combed and well greased, with a large number of different rings on his white fingers scrubbed clean with a brush, and wearing gold chains on his vest. he even spoke a few words of decent french with a foreigner who was waiting there. “luiza ivanovna, why don’t you take a seat?” he said in passing to the well-dressed lady with the dark red complexion, who was still standing there, as if she dared not sit down, although a chair was nearby. “ich danke,” she said softly, and lowered herself onto the chair with a sound of rustling silk. her light blue dress trimmed with white lace spread out around her chair like a balloon and filled almost half the room. there was a strong odor of perfume. the lady was obviously embarrassed that she was occupying so much space and giving off the scent of her perfume, although she smiled in a way that combined both cowardice and impudence, but with evident discomfort. the lady in mourning finished at last and was about to stand up. all of a sudden, an officer entered, raucously strutting and swaggering in an extremely sprightly way, threw his cockaded cap on the table, and sat down in an armchair. upon seeing him, the elegant lady immediately jumped up and curtsied to him with great gusto. while the officer didn’t pay her the least bit of attention, she dared not remain seated in his presence any longer. he was a lieutenant, the police superintendent’s assistant, and had a reddish mustache protruding horizontally in both directions and extremely fine facial features, expressing nothing whatsoever, however, except a certain insolence. he regarded raskolnikov out of the corner of his eye, in part with indignation: his apparel was too disgraceful and, in spite of all his wretchedness, his behavior didn’t fit his dress; raskolnikov, with a lack of care, stared at him so directly and for so long that the officer felt offended. “what are you doing here?” he shouted, probably astonished that such a ragged fellow hadn’t considered effacing himself when confronted with his scorching gaze. “i was sent for . . . by this summons,” raskolnikov managed to explain. “it concerns the recovery of some money from him, from that student, ” the head clerk hastened to reply, tearing himself away from his papers. “here you are, sir!” he said, pointing to a place in a notebook and then tossing it at raskolnikov. “read it!” “money? what money?” wondered raskolnikov. “but . . . this means it’s"
dostoevsky,"certainly not about that !” he shuddered with delight. suddenly he felt terribly, inexpressibly carefree. a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. “what time were you told to appear, kind sir?” cried the lieutenant, feeling more and more offended for some reason. “you were told to come at nine o’clock and it’s now already past eleven!” “it was delivered only a quarter of an hour ago,” raskolnikov replied loudly and over his shoulder, also suddenly and unexpectedly growing angry, even taking a certain pleasure in this feeling. “isn’t it enough that i’m ill with a fever, yet i came all the same?” “no shouting, if you please!” “i’m not shouting; i’m speaking very calmly; it’s you who is shouting; i’m a student, and i won’t allow you to shout at me.” the lieutenant was so incensed that at first he was unable to utter a word; only some spit came flying out of his mouth. he jumped up from his place. “shut your mouth! you’re in a government office. no r-r-r-udeness, sir!” “you’re in a government office, too,” raskolnikov cried, “and not only are you shouting, but you’re also smoking a cigarette and being impolite to all of us.” after he said this, raskolnikov felt inexpressible pleasure. the head clerk regarded them with a smile. the hotheaded lieutenant was obviously bewildered. “that’s none of your business, sir!” he shouted at last in an unnaturally loud voice. “be so good as to provide the required response. show him, aleksandr grigorevich. * there are complaints against you. you don’t pay your debts. what an upstanding citizen you are!” but raskolnikov was no longer listening; he greedily snatched the document, searching for a solution to the riddle. he read it once, then again, but still didn’t understand. “what’s this?” he asked the head clerk. “money is being demanded from you according to this promissory note. you must either pay up with all costs, fines, and so forth, or else provide a written statement indicating when you will be able to pay and, at the same time, agree that you will not leave the capital before settling the debt, and that you will not sell or conceal your property. the lender is free to sell your property and to pursue all legal steps against you.” “but i don’t owe anyone any money!” “that’s none of our business. we received a legitimate claim for overdue payment on a promissory note for one hundred and fifty rubles, given by you to the collegiate assessor’s widow, zarnitsyna, approximately nine months ago; it was transferred by the widow zarnitsyna as payment to the court councillor chebarov, and it is for this reason that we’re summoning you to provide a statement.” “but she’s my landlady.” “what if she is?” the head clerk regarded him with a condescending smile of pity, together with a certain exultation, as if looking at a new recruit coming under fire for the first time, as though saying, “well, how do you feel now?” how could he possibly care about a promissory note at this time, or about some overdue payment? was it worth even the slightest concern in its turn, even the least bit of attention? he stood there, read, listened, replied, and even asked, but he did it all automatically. the triumph of self-preservation, deliverance from threatening danger—that was what filled his entire being at this moment, without apprehension, without analysis, without future problems and solutions, without doubts and questions. it was a moment of complete, spontaneous, pure animal delight. but at this very moment there occurred something in the office akin to a thunderbolt. the lieutenant, still entirely shaken by his lack of respect, still irritated, and apparently wishing to soothe his offended vanity, began fulminating at the unfortunate “elegant lady,” who’d been staring at him with a very foolish smile since he had entered the office. “and you, madam, you old so-and-so,” he shouted suddenly at the top of his lungs (the lady in mourning had already left). “what on earth was going on at your place last night? huh? once again you’re bringing disgrace and debauchery to the whole street. once more, fighting and drunkenness. you want to wind up in jail? i’ve already told you, i’ve warned you a dozen times, and i won’t let you get away with it anymore! but you did it again, you old so-and-so!” the paper actually dropped from raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked intensely at the elegant lady, who was being rebuked so unceremoniously. he soon realized what it was all about and even found this episode immediately to his liking. he listened with pleasure and even felt very much like laughing, and laughing, and laughing. . . . all his nerves were on edge. “ilya petrovich!” the head clerk was about to say solicitously, but he paused because he knew from his own experience that it was impossible to restrain the lieutenant except by force once he was so incensed. at first the elegant lady trembled as a result of this thunder and lightning. but it was strange: the more numerous and the harsher his words of abuse, the more civil her demeanor became, the more charming her smile directed at the fearsome lieutenant. she shifted restlessly from foot to foot and kept curtsying incessantly, biding her time impatiently until she could at last get a word in edgewise. “zer vas no noise und no fighting at mine haus, herr kapitän, ” she rattled out all of a sudden, as if scattering peas, with a heavy german accent even though she spoke russian fluently. “und no shkandal, none vatever, und zey came trunken, und i vill tell all, herr kapitän, und i’m not guilty. . . . i haf respectable haus, herr kapitän, und respectable vay of life, herr kapitän, and i never, never vanted no shkandal in mine haus. und dey came completely trunken, and den dey asked for drei bottles more, and zen one puts hiz foots up und"

so a literary man, a writer, received five rubles in your ‘respectable house’ for his coattail? there’s another one of them, those writers!” he cast a contemptuous glance at raskolnikov. “three days ago there was another scandal in the tavern: a fellow ate his dinner and didn’t want to pay for it; ‘i’ll put you,’ he says, ‘into my satire.’ there was another one on a steamer last week: someone abused the family of a state councillor, his wife and daughter, with the foulest language. one fellow was thrown out of a pastry shop a few days ago. that’s what they’re like these writers, literary men, students, loudmouths. . . . damn them! off with you! i’ll call in at your place one of these days . . . then, you watch out! you hear me?” luiza ivanovna hastened to curtsy in all directions with hurried politeness, and as she did, she made her way backward toward the door. but in the doorway, her rear end collided with a stately officer who had a fresh, open face and who sported a splendid, thick blond mustache. it was none other than nikodim fomich himself, the district police superintendent. luiza ivanovna hastened to curtsy very deeply to him; hopping up and down with her rapid little steps, she flew out of the office. “once again an uproar, once more thunder and lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes!” nikodim fomich addressed ilya petrovich politely and amicably. “once again they upset you and you lost your temper! i could hear it outside on the stairs.” “whatuvit?” ilya petrovich said with magnanimous nonchalance (he didn’t even say “what of it?” but somehow “whatuvit?”), moving to another desk with some documents, strutting picturesquely with each step as he did so, swaying his shoulders in time with his steps. “here you are, sir, if you’d care to see: mr. writer, that is, a student, that is, a former student, doesn’t pay his debt. his promissory note’s overdue, he won’t leave his apartment, there are constant complaints against him, and he has the nerve to object to the fact that i lit a cigarette in front of him! he’s behaving like a scoundrel; here, sir, just have a look at him: he’s a most attractive sight!” “poverty’s no crime, my friend, and that’s that. you’re known to be like gunpowder: you can’t tolerate any insults. you took offense at something he said and were unable to restrain yourself,” nikodim fomich continued, turning courteously to raskolnikov, “but that was to no avail: he’s one of our best men, our ver-r-r-ry best men, i tell you, but he’s like gunpowder, pure gunpowder! he flared up, lost his temper, exploded—and that’s that! all’s lost! and, as a result, all that’s left is his heart of gold! in his regiment he was nicknamed ‘lieutenant porokh’ . . .” † “and what a regiment it was!” cried ilya petrovich, extremely pleased to be teased in that manner, but still sulking. raskolnikov suddenly felt like saying something particularly pleasant to all assembled. “pardon me, captain,” he began very casually, suddenly addressing nikodim fomich, “put yourself in my place. . . . i’m even prepared to beg his pardon, if i’ve been impolite. i’m a poor, sick student, disheartened”—he actually used the word “disheartened”—“by poverty. i’m a former student because i can no longer support myself, but i’ll be receiving some money soon. . . . i have a mother and a sister in a certain province. they’ll send me some money, and then i’ll . . . i’ll pay up. my landlady’s a good woman, but she’s so angry because i’ve lost my teaching and haven’t paid my rent for the last three months that she won’t even send me any dinner. . . . i don’t understand what promissory note you’re talking about! now she’s demanding payment according to this acknowledgment of debt: judge for yourself!” “this doesn’t concern us . . .” the head clerk began to observe again . . . “please, allow me, i’m in complete agreement with you, but permit me to explain,” raskolnikov began again, addressing not the head clerk, but nikodim fomich, though making a valiant effort also to include ilya petrovich, who"
dostoevsky,"was pretending to riffle through some papers and refusing contemptuously to pay any attention to him. “permit me to explain on my part that i’ve been living there for almost three years, from the time i first arrived from the provinces, and previously . . . previously . . . why not acknowledge, in turn, that from the very beginning i made a promise to marry the landlady’s daughter, a verbal promise, of my own free will. . . . she was a young woman . . . in fact, i even took a liking to her . . . although i wasn’t in love with her . . . in a word, it was youth, that is, i want to state that the landlady afforded me a great deal of credit and, in part, i led a life of . . . i was very frivolous . . .” “we’re not demanding such intimacies from you, my dear sir, and besides we haven’t the time,” ilya petrovich said, interrupting him rudely and with smugness, but raskolnikov cut him off excitedly, even though it was very painful for him to continue. “but allow me, please allow me, to tell it all to some extent . . . how it was and . . . in its turn . . . although i agree with you that it’s unnecessary to recount. a year ago this young woman died from typhus, while, however, i continued to be a tenant there as i had been, and the landlady, as she moved into the apartment where she now resides, said to me . . . and she said it amicably . . . that she had every confidence in me and so on . . . but wouldn’t i like to provide her with an acknowledgment of debt for one hundred and fifty rubles, the amount she’d calculated as the total of what i owed. allow me to state, sir: she said precisely that once i gave her this document, she’d extend as much credit to me as i required once again, and never, never, for her part—and these were her exact words—never would she use that letter before i myself paid my debt. . . . and now, when i’ve lost my teaching and have nothing to eat, she’s demanding repayment. . . . what can i say now?” “none of these sentimental details, my dear sir, concern us,” ilya petrovich said arrogantly. “you must respond and acknowledge your obligation, while the fact that you happened to be in love and all those tragic particulars, all that is none of our business.” “you’re being . . . a bit harsh,” muttered nikodim fomich, sitting down at the table, where he started signing documents. he was feeling somewhat embarrassed. “so now write,” the head clerk said to raskolnikov. “what?” he asked in somewhat of a rude manner. “what i dictate.” it seemed to raskolnikov that the head clerk had become ruder and more contemptuous of him after his confession, but strange to say—he suddenly felt that no one else’s opinion mattered to him at all, and this change seemed to take place in one single instant. if he’d wanted to consider it for a while, then of course he’d be astounded at how he was able to speak to them that way just a minute ago, and even impose his own feelings on them. where had these feelings come from? on the contrary, now, if the room had suddenly filled up not with police officers, but with his closest true friends, even then, it seems, he wouldn’t have been able to find even one kind word to say to them, because his heart was suddenly so emptied of all emotion. gloomy feelings of tormenting, unending loneliness and alienation suddenly and consciously took possession of his soul. it wasn’t the despondency of his heartfelt outpourings in ilya petrovich’s presence, nor was it this same despondency or the lieutenant’s triumph over him that affected his heart so suddenly. what did he care about his own baseness now, or all these ambitions, lieutenants, german women, procedures, offices, so on and so forth? even if he had been sentenced to be burned alive at that very moment, even then he wouldn’t have batted an eye; it’s doubtful that he would’ve even listened attentively to his sentence. something totally unfamiliar was happening to him, something new, unexpected, never before experienced. it wasn’t so much that he understood, but that he clearly felt, with all the strength of his feeling, that not only with his previous sentimental expansiveness, but even with whatever resources he had available, he was no longer able to communicate with these people in the police office, even if instead of their being just police officers, they were all his own brothers and sisters, even then he would have had no reason to communicate with them, not for anything in his life. never before, up to this very moment, had he experienced any feeling so strange and so terrible. what was the most tormenting of all—was that it was more of a feeling than a conscious thought or perception, a spontaneous feeling, the most tormenting of all those feelings experienced by him in his life up to this point. the head clerk began dictating the form of an ordinary statement in such a case, that is: “i am unable to pay, i promise to do so at some future date, i will not leave town, sell my property, or give it away, etc. etc.” “but you can’t even write properly; the pen’s slipping out of your hand,” observed the head clerk, staring at raskolnikov with curiosity. “are you ill?” “yes . . . i feel dizzy. . . . go on!” “that’s all! sign it.” the head clerk took the paper and turned to other matters. raskolnikov handed the pen back to him, but instead of getting up to leave, placed both elbows on the table and"
dostoevsky,"took his head in his hands. it was as if a nail were being driven into his temple. a strange thought occurred to him suddenly: to get up right then, go over to nikodim fomich, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, everything to the last detail, then go with him to his own apartment and show him the things in the hole in the corner. this impulse was so strong that he’d already stood up to carry it out. “shouldn’t i take at least a moment to think about it?” flashed through his mind. “no, it’s better to do it without thinking, and get it off my back!” but all of a sudden he stopped like someone rooted to the ground. nikodim fomich was talking heatedly to ilya petrovich, and some of their words reached his ears: “it can’t be; they’ll release both of them! in the first place, it contradicts everything. judge for yourself: why should they call the caretaker, if they’d done the deed? to implicate themselves? or is it a clever trick? no, that would be too clever! moreover, both caretakers and the woman trader saw the student pestryakov near the gates just as he was arriving: he was out there with three friends, parted from them near the gate, and asked the caretakers about residence in the building in the presence of these friends. well, would someone ask about residence if he’d come with such an intention? and kokh, before he went to see the old woman, had been sitting downstairs with the silversmith for half an hour and at precisely quarter to eight went upstairs to see her. now just consider . . .” “but permit me, look at the contradiction that’s emerged: they state that they knocked and that the door was locked, but three minutes later, when they arrived with the caretaker, it turns out that the door was unlocked.” “that’s precisely the point: without fail the murderer was still inside and had locked the door. without fail they’d have discovered him there if kokh hadn’t been such a fool and gone to fetch the caretaker. and precisely in this interval, he’d managed to head down the stairs and somehow slip past them. kokh should thank his lucky stars: ‘if i’d have stayed there,’ he said, ‘he’d have jumped out and killed me with his axe.’ he wants to give thanks at a special church service, ha, ha, ha . . .” “no one saw the murderer?” “how could they? the building’s as crowded as noah’s ark,” the head clerk observed, overhearing the conversation from where he sat. “it’s clear as day, clear as day,” nikodim fomich repeated excitedly. “no, it’s not clear at all,” summed up ilya petrovich. raskolnikov took his hat and headed for the door, but he never made it that far . . . when he came to, he saw that he was sitting on a chair, that some person was supporting him on the right, that another man was standing on his left holding a yellow glass filled with yellowish water, ‡ and that nikodim fomich was standing in front of him, staring at him intently; raskolnikov stood up from where he was sitting. “what’s wrong? are you ill?” nikodim fomich asked him rather harshly. “when he was signing, he could scarcely hold the pen,” observed the head clerk, sitting back down at his place and returning to his papers. “have you been ill for long?” cried ilya petrovich from where he was sitting, also attending to some documents. he, too, of course, had scrutinized the sick man when he’d fainted, but he’d walked away as soon as raskolnikov had come to. “since yesterday,” raskolnikov muttered in reply. “did you go out yesterday?” “i did.” “sick?” “yes.” “at what time?” “after seven in the evening.” “where, if i may ask?” “down the street.” “well, that’s short and sweet.” to all these questions raskolnikov replied sharply, abruptly, white as a sheet, without dropping his dark, inflamed eyes when confronted with ilya petrovich’s gaze. “he can hardly stand, while you think . . .” remarked nikodim fomich. “ne-ver mind!” ilya petrovich replied strangely. nikodim fomich was about to add something more, but, glancing at the head clerk, who was also staring at him intently, he fell silent. everyone was suddenly quiet. it was strange. “well, sir, that’s fine, sir,” concluded ilya petrovich. “we won’t detain you.” raskolnikov left. he could hear how a lively conversation resumed as soon as he’d gone out; the questioning voice of nikodim fomich was heard above the others. . . . he recovered completely once outside. “a search, a search, an immediate search!” he repeated to himself, hastening home. “those rascals! they suspect me!” his former fear overcame him again completely from head to toe. * zametov, the chief police clerk. † porokh = gunpowder, hence the lieutenant’s nickname. ‡ residents of petersburg took their water from rivers and canals. oceanofpdf.com ii “w hat if there’s already been a search? what if i find them there right now?” but there was his room. nothing and no one: no one had been there. even nastasya hadn’t touched it. but, lord! how could he have left all those things in that hole under the wallpaper? he rushed to the corner, thrust his hand in, began pulling things out and loading them into his pockets. there were eight items in all: two small boxes with earrings or something of that sort—he didn’t look very carefully—and four small morocco leather cases. one chain was simply wrapped up in newspaper. there was something else also wrapped in newspaper, probably a medal . . . he stashed them all in various pockets in his coat and in his right trouser pocket, trying to make it all look less noticeable. he also picked up the purse full of things. then he left his room, this time even leaving the door wide open. he walked rapidly and decisively; although he felt"
dostoevsky,"completely devastated, he still had his wits about him. he was afraid of being followed, afraid that in half an hour, perhaps even a quarter of an hour, an order would be issued to have him followed; therefore, no matter what happened, he had to hide all traces before then. he had to act while he still had some strength left and some powers of reasoning. . . . but where should he go? it had all been decided long ago: “throw everything into the canal: get rid of all traces and that would be the end of it.” he had made that decision at night, in his delirium, when, as he recalled, he had tried several times to stand up and leave “quickly, quickly, and get rid of it all.” but it proved to be very difficult to get rid of. he had been wandering along the embankment of the yekaterinsky canal for about half an hour, perhaps even longer; several times he looked at the staircases leading down to the water. but he couldn’t even conceive of carrying out his intention: either there were rafts moored at the bottom of the stairs where women were washing their linens, or else boats were tied up and the stairs were teeming with people; in addition, from there along both embankments one could be observed, noticed: it would look very suspicious if a man intentionally went down the stairs, paused, and threw something into the water. what if the cases floated instead of sank? of course, that’s what would happen. everyone would see them. even without that, everyone he met would look up, stare at him, as if he was all they had to be concerned about. “why is that the case? perhaps i’m merely imagining it?” he wondered. finally it occurred to him that it might be better to go somewhere farther along the neva. there would be fewer people and he’d be less noticeable; in any event, it would be more convenient; but the main thing is that it would be farther away from where he was now. he was suddenly surprised to realize that he’d been wandering around in anguish and anxiety for an entire half hour, and in dangerous places, yet he had been unable to come up with this idea until now! consequently, he had wasted half an hour in a foolish enterprise that had already been decided in his sleep, in his delirium! he was becoming extremely absentminded and forgetful, and he knew that himself. he definitely had to hurry! he started walking along voznesensky prospect toward the neva; but on the way, another idea suddenly occurred to him: “why the neva? why into the water? wouldn’t it be better to go somewhere far away, maybe even to the islands, and somewhere, in an isolated place, in the woods, under a bush—bury it all and mark the spot?” even though he felt that he was in no condition to consider this idea clearly and sensibly at the time, it seemed flawless. but he wasn’t destined to reach the islands, either: something else occurred. as he emerged from voznesensky prospect into the square, he suddenly saw on his left an entrance to a courtyard surrounded by windowless walls. directly to the right of the gate stretched the long, blank unwhitewashed wall of the adjacent four-story building. to the left, parallel to the blank wall and also close to the gate, a wooden fence ran about twenty paces into the courtyard, then turned to the left. it was a deserted, enclosed space where various materials lay scattered. farther on, in the depths of the courtyard, the corner of a low, sooty stone shed peered out from behind the fence, evidently part of a workshop. there was someone here, a carriage maker or metalworker, or someone of the kind; the entire area, right from the gates, was blackened with a great deal of coal dust. “this would be a good place to hide the stuff and get away,” he thought suddenly. after seeing no one in the courtyard, he strode through the gates and noticed at once, right next to the gate, a trench dug along the fence (the kind often found in buildings with many factory workers, craftsmen, cabdrivers, etc.), and above the trench, on the fence, were the witty words scribbled in chalk regularly found in such circumstances: for bidden to stopp hear . good: therefore he would arouse no suspicion if he went in and paused. “stash it all together in one pile and get away!” glancing around once more, he had already thrust his hand into his pocket when he suddenly noticed by the outer wall, between the gate and the trench, where the distance was about a yard wide, a large unworked block, weighing perhaps as much as fifty pounds, leaning directly against the stone wall. beyond it lay the street, the sidewalk, and the sounds of hurrying passersby, of whom there were always quite a few; but no one could notice him behind the gate, except if someone turned in from the street, which, by the way, could easily happen, and therefore he had to hurry. he bent over, grabbed the top of the block powerfully with both hands, gathered all his strength, and turned it over. there was a small hollow underneath; he immediately began emptying everything from his pockets. the purse wound up on top of the pile, and there still remained some space in the hollow. then he grabbed the block again and, with one turn, shoved it back into its former place, perhaps now sitting a little bit higher. but he scraped up some dirt and pressed it around the bottom of the block with his foot. nothing was noticeable. then he left the courtyard and headed off to the square. once again he was momentarily overcome by a strong feeling of joy, such as he’d experienced before in the police station. “all traces have been buried! who,"
dostoevsky,"who on earth would ever think of searching under that stone? it may have been there since the house was built and will be there just as long. and if someone did find the stash: who would suspect me? it’s all over! there’s no evidence!” he started laughing. later he recalled that he had started laughing with a nervous, shallow, inaudible, long-lasting laugh, and kept laughing all the while he was crossing the square. but when he reached konnogvardeisky boulevard, where two days ago he had encountered that young woman, his laughter suddenly vanished. other thoughts flooded his mind. all of a sudden he felt that it would be terribly unpleasant to pass that bench where he had sat and thought after the girl’s departure, and that it would also be terribly painful to encounter that policeman with the mustache to whom he had given his twenty kopecks at the time: “to hell with him!” he walked along, looking around absentmindedly and spitefully. all his thoughts now revolved around one main point—he himself felt that it was really the main point, and that now, precisely at this moment, he was all alone, face-to-face with this main point—and that it was even happening for the very first time after these last two months. “to hell with it all!” he thought suddenly in a fit of unlimited malice. “well, if it’s begun, then it’s begun. to hell with this new life! lord, how stupid it all is! i’ve told so many lies and done nasty things today! how disgustingly i fawned and flattered that despicable ilya petrovich! but that’s all nonsense, too! i don’t give a damn about any of them or the fact that i fawned and flattered him! that’s not the point! that’s not it at all!” all of a sudden he stopped; a new, completely unexpected and extremely simple question dazed and astounded him. “if this whole affair was carried out consciously, and not in some foolish manner, if i really had a definite and definitive goal, then how is it that up to this point i didn’t even peek into the purse and don’t know how much i’ve taken? why did i consciously assume all these torments? why did i undertake this mean, vile, base act? just now i wanted to throw it all into the water, the purse, together with all the items that i haven’t even looked at. . . . how can this be?” yes, that was true. that was all true. besides, he’d known all this before and it was not a new question for him; last night when he’d decided to throw it all into the water, it had been decided without any hesitation or objection, just as if that was how it ought to be, as if it couldn’t be otherwise. . . . he knew all this and recalled it all; it was all decided yesterday, when he was bending over the old woman’s trunk, pulling out those leather cases. . . . that was all true! “it’s all because i’m very ill,” he decided gloomily once and for all. “i’ve tortured and tormented myself, and i don’t even know what i’m doing. . . . yesterday, and the day before, and during all this time i’ve been tormenting myself. . . . i’ll get better and then . . . i won’t torment myself. . . . what if i don’t get better? lord! i’m so fed up with all this!” he walked without stopping. he very much wanted to distract himself, but didn’t know what to do or what to try. a new, insurmountable feeling was overtaking him more and more with every passing minute: it was some constant, almost physical repulsion for everything that he was encountering and all that surrounded him, a stubborn, malicious, hateful feeling. everyone he met seemed repulsive to him—their faces, their walk, and their gestures. if someone had begun talking to him, he felt, he might spit at them or bite them . . . he stopped suddenly when he emerged on the embankment of the little neva on vasilievsky island, near the bridge. “here’s where he lives, in this building,” he thought. “how is it that somehow i wound up at razumikhin’s place? it’s the same story as before. . . . but it’s very odd: did i come here intentionally or was i simply walking and ended up here? it’s all the same; two days ago . . . i said . . . i’d go see him a day after that . well, so i will! as if i couldn’t drop in on him now . . .” he climbed up to razumikhin’s room on the fifth floor. he was at home in his little room; at that moment he was busy writing; he unlocked the door himself. they hadn’t seen each other in about four months. razumikhin had been sitting there in his dressing gown, which was worn to tatters, with slippers on his bare feet; he was disheveled, unshaven, and unwashed. but his face expressed surprise. “what’s the matter with you?” he cried, examining his friend from head to foot; then he fell silent and whistled shrilly. “are things really so bad? my friend, you’ve outdone people like us,” he added, looking at raskolnikov’s rags. “sit down, you must be tired!” when his friend had collapsed on the turkish oilcloth sofa, which was in even worse condition than raskolnikov’s own, razumikhin suddenly realized that his guest was ill. “you’re really sick, you know that?” he reached out to take his pulse; raskolnikov pulled his arm away. “there’s no need,” he said. “i’ve come to . . . here’s what: i have no lessons. . . . i would like to . . . but i really don’t need any lessons . . .” “you know what? you’re delirious!” razumikhin remarked, observing him closely. “no, i’m not delirious,” raskolnikov said, standing up from the sofa. on his way to"
dostoevsky,"see razumikhin, he hadn’t thought about having to come face-to-face with him. now, in one moment, he surmised, based on his experience, that he was not inclined at that minute to come face-to-face with anyone at all on earth. all his bile rose up in him. he almost choked on anger at himself for having just crossed razumikhin’s threshold. “good-bye!” he said suddenly and headed for the door. “wait a minute, you madman, wait!” “there’s no need!” raskolnikov repeated, pulling his arm away again. “what the hell did you come here for in the first place? are you crazy, or what? why . . . this is almost insulting. i won’t let you go.” “well, listen: i came to see you because besides you, i don’t know anyone else who could help . . . to start . . . because you’re kinder than all of them, that is, you’re smarter, and you can judge. . . . but now i see that i have no need, you hear, no need at all . . . for anyone’s favors or concern. . . . i myself . . . all alone. . . . that’s all! leave me in peace!” “wait a moment, you derelict! you’re completely mad! as far as i’m concerned, you can do as you like. you see, i don’t have any lessons either, but i don’t give a damn; there’s a bookseller at the flea market by the name of kheruvimov who’s a kind of lesson in himself. i wouldn’t trade him for five lessons in any merchant’s house. he does a little publishing and puts out booklets on the natural sciences—and do they sell! the titles alone are worth the price! you always say that i’m a fool; well, friend, i swear there are bigger fools than me! now he’s turned toward progressive politics; he hasn’t a clue about it, but i encourage him, of course. here are some forty pages of a german text—in my opinion, it’s the dumbest charlatanism: in a word, it examines the question of whether a woman can be considered a human being or not. well, naturally, it demonstrates solemnly that a woman is indeed a human being. kheruvimov is planning to publish it as a contribution to the woman question; * i’m translating it; he’ll stretch those forty pages to a hundred, we’ll come up with the most splendid title, at least half a page long, and then we’ll sell it for fifty kopecks. it’ll work! i get six rubles for sixteen pages, which means about fifteen rubles for the whole thing, and i got six rubles in advance. after we finish this, we’ll start translating a piece on whales, and then we’ll publish the most boring scandalous sections of the second part of confessions; † someone told kheruvimov that rousseau is like our radishchev. ‡ of course, i won’t contradict him—the hell with him! well, how would you like to translate the second part of “are women human beings?” if you do, then take the text, take some pens and paper—it’s all been provided—and here are three rubles. since i got an advance on the whole thing, for the first and the second parts, it would come to three rubles for your share. when you finish that part—you’ll get another three rubles. here’s what else: don’t think i’m doing you any favors. on the contrary, just when you showed up, i was already wondering about how you could help me. in the first place, my spelling is awful; in the second, my german is sometimes simply not up to it, so i make it up and console myself by thinking that the result comes out even better. who knows, perhaps it’s not any better, but even worse. . . . will you take it or not?” without saying a word, raskolnikov took the pages of the german article, picked up the three rubles, and walked out in silence. razumikhin followed him with his eyes in bewilderment. but, after having reached the first line, § raskolnikov suddenly turned around, climbed the stairs back up to razumikhin’s, and, placing both the german pages and the three rubles down on the table, left again, without saying a word. “are you delirious, or what?” an enraged razumikhin roared at last. “what sort of comedy are you playing? you’ve confused me completely. . . . damn it all, why did you come here?” “i don’t need any . . . translations,” muttered raskolnikov, starting down the stairs. “so what in hell do you need?” razumikhin shouted from above. raskolnikov continued down the stairs. “hey, you! where do you live?” there was no reply. “well, then, to hell with you!” but raskolnikov was already on the street. on the nikolaevsky bridge he was forced back to his senses once again as a result of an extremely unpleasant episode. a carriage driver struck his back soundly with a whip because raskolnikov had nearly stumbled and fallen under the horses in spite of the fact that the driver had shouted to him three or four times. the blow from the whip infuriated him so much that he jumped aside to the bridge railing (it’s unclear why he was walking down the middle where vehicles go, not pedestrians); he gnashed and ground his teeth furiously. all around, of course, laughter resounded. “serves him right!” “he’s some kind of rogue.” “it’s a well-known trick: they pretend to be drunk and fall down intentionally under the carriage wheels. then you’re responsible for them.” “that’s how they make their money, my dear sir, that’s how . . .” but just then, as he was standing near the railing, staring foolishly and irately after the disappearing carriage, rubbing his back, he suddenly felt that someone was thrusting money into his hand. he glanced around: it was an elderly woman wearing a head scarf and goatskin shoes, accompanied by a young girl wearing a hat and carrying a green parasol, probably her"
dostoevsky,"daughter. “here, my friend, for the love of christ.” he took it, and they walked on past. it was a twenty-kopeck piece. judging by his clothes and appearance, they could easily have mistaken him for a beggar, someone out asking for half-kopeck pieces in the streets; for the gift of a twenty-kopeck piece he was probably obligated to the blow from the whip, which had caused them to take pity on him. he squeezed the coin in his hand, walked on about ten paces, and turned to face the neva in the direction of the palace. the sky had not the slightest trace of any cloud and the water looked almost blue, which rarely happens at the neva. the dome of the cathedral, the outline of which could not appear more conspicuously from any other point of view than this spot on the bridge, some twenty paces from the chapel, was gleaming; through the clear air one could discern every last detail of its decoration. the pain from the whip’s lash had eased, and raskolnikov forgot all about the blow; one anxious and somewhat hazy thought now preoccupied him exclusively. he stood there and gazed into the distance intently and for a long time; this place was very familiar to him. when he’d been attending classes at the university, ordinarily—most often, on his way home—perhaps as many as a hundred times, he’d happened to pause precisely at this spot and stare fixedly at that genuinely majestic panorama; each and every time he would marvel at his own indistinct and inexplicable impression. an unaccountable chill always came over him as a result of this splendid sight; for him, this opulent picture was filled with a deaf and mute spirit. . . . he was surprised each time by this gloomy and enigmatic impression; not trusting himself, he would defer its solution to the future. all of a sudden, he recalled abruptly his former questions and perplexity, and it seemed that this was all happening now for some good reason. it was strange and mysterious that he had paused at the very same place as before, as if he really imagined that he could think about the same things now as he had then, that the same subjects and images could interest him as they had before . . . not so long ago. it even struck him as almost amusing, while at the same time he felt somewhat heartsick. somewhere down below, in the depths, visible just beneath his feet, he seemed to see all of his recent past, his previous thoughts, previous problems, previous subjects, previous impressions, this entire panorama, even himself, and everything else, everything. . . . he seemed to soar somewhere upward, and then everything disappeared from sight. . . . after making an involuntary movement of his hand, he suddenly felt the twenty-kopeck piece grasped tightly in his fist. he opened his hand, stared intently at the coin, wound up his arm, and threw it into the water; then he turned around and went home. it seemed as if at that very moment he had cut himself off with a pair of scissors from everyone and everything. it was already evening when he arrived home; he had been out walking for about six hours. he didn’t recall where he had been or how he’d come back. after getting undressed, trembling all over like a horse driven to exhaustion, he lay down on the sofa, pulled his coat over himself, and immediately lost consciousness . . . it was deep twilight when he came to, upon hearing a terrible scream. good lord, what a scream! he had never before heard such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, gnashing, weeping, beating, and cursing. he couldn’t even imagine such brutality, such rage. he raised himself up and sat on his bed, rendered immobile and tormented at every moment. but the struggle, the wailing, and the cursing became louder and louder. then, to his enormous astonishment, he suddenly recognized his landlady’s voice. she wailed, squealed, and moaned, hurrying, hastening, emitting words in such a way that it was impossible to understand what she was pleading for—of course, that they would stop beating her because she was being thrashed mercilessly on the staircase. the voice of the one beating her had become so terrible from rage and fury that it was now merely rasping hoarsely, but this person was also saying something or other, also rapidly, indecipherably, hastening, and choking. all of a sudden raskolnikov began trembling like a leaf. he recognized that voice: it was that of ilya petrovich. “ilya petrovich is here, and he’s beating the landlady! he’s kicking her, knocking her head against the stairs—it’s apparent and it’s audible from the sounds, the wails, and the blows! what’s happening? has the world turned upside down, or what?” one could hear how on every floor, up and down the staircase, a crowd was gathering; voices could be heard, exclamations, as people came out, knocked on doors, slammed them shut, and then clustered. “but why, what for, how is it possible?” he repeated, thinking in earnest that he had gone mad. only no, he was hearing it all too distinctly! but if that were the case, of course they’d be coming for him at any moment, “because . . . most likely, all because of that . . . what happened yesterday. . . . good lord!” he wanted to lock his door, but his arm wouldn’t move . . . and it would have been to no avail! an icy fear seized his soul, tormented him, and immobilized him. . . . but now, at last, all this uproar, which had gone on for a good ten minutes, gradually began to subside. the landlady moaned and groaned, ilya petrovich still threatening her and cursing. . . . but now, finally, he, too, seemed to have quieted down; his voice could no longer be heard. “has he really gone? oh, lord!”"
dostoevsky,"yes, the landlady was also leaving, still moaning and weeping . . . now her door slammed shut. . . . now the crowd was dispersing from the stairway, everyone to their own apartments—exclaiming, arguing, calling to one another, first raising their voices to shout, then lowering them to whisper. there must have been a great many of them; almost the entire building had come running. “but, my god, how is it possible? why did he come here? what for?” raskolnikov collapsed weakly onto the sofa, but he could no longer close his eyes; he lay there for about half an hour in a state of suffering, with an unbearable feeling of unending terror such as he had never experienced before. suddenly bright light illuminated his room: nasta­sya came in carrying a candle and a bowl of soup. after scrutinizing him carefully and seeing that he was not asleep, she placed the candle on the table and began laying out the things she’d brought: bread, salt, the bowl, and a spoon. “you probably haven’t eaten since yesterday. you were out gallivanting the whole day; besides, you had a fever.” “nastasya . . . why did they beat the landlady?” she stared at him intently. “who beat the landlady?” “just now . . . half an hour ago, ilya petrovich, the police superintendent’s assistant, on the staircase. . . . why did he give her such a beating? and . . . why did he come here?” nastasya frowned and stared at him in silence for a long time. he felt very uncomfortable as a result of her stare, even frightened. “nastasya, why don’t you say something?” he finally asked timidly in a weak voice. “it’s the blood,” she replied at last, softly and as if talking to herself. “blood! what blood?” he muttered, growing pale and moving toward the wall. nastasya continued staring at him. “no one beat the landlady,” she said in a stern and definitive voice. he looked at her, hardly breathing. “i heard it myself . . . i wasn’t asleep . . . i was sitting here,” he said even more timidly. “i listened for a long time. . . . the superintendent’s assistant came. . . . everyone came running out onto the staircase, from all the apartments . . .” “no one came. it’s the blood crying out inside you. it’s when it has no way of getting out and it’s trying to clog your liver; you begin seeing things. . . . will you eat something or not?” he made no reply. nastasya stood over him, staring at him, and didn’t leave. “let me have something to drink . . . nastasyushka.” she went downstairs and returned a few minutes later with some water in a white clay mug; but he would not remember what happened next. he remembered only that he swallowed one mouthful of cold water and spilled some from the mug on his chest. then came unconsciousness. * the discussion of women’s rights was active among progressive circles in the s. † jean-jacques rousseau’s confessions (–) was one of the most famous autobiographies. a russian translation appeared in . ‡ aleksandr radishchev (–) was a leading liberal writer who opposed serfdom and the russian judicial system. § the streets on vasilievsky island are numbered and referred to as “lines.” oceanofpdf.com iii h owever, raskolnikov was not completely unconscious throughout his illness; he had a feverish condition with periods of delirium and semiconsciousness. he remembered a great deal afterward. first, there seemed to be many people surrounding him, wanting to pick him up and carry him somewhere; they stood over him, arguing and quarreling. then he was suddenly all alone in his room; everyone had left and they were all afraid of him; from time to time, they merely opened his door slightly to have a look at him, threaten him, confer about something or other among themselves, or laugh and tease him. he recalled that nastasya was often at his side; he distinguished one other person, someone very familiar, but who that was precisely—he was unable to discern; he was sad about that and even wept. sometimes it seemed that he’d been lying there for about a month; another time, that it was still the same day he had fallen ill. but about that —he had completely forgotten about that; on the other hand, he constantly recalled that he had forgotten about something that he should not have forgotten about—he suffered and agonized, trying to remember; he moaned, fell into a rage or into horrible, unbearable fear. then he would try to hoist himself up, wanting to run away, but someone always restrained him forcibly, and he would sink into weakness and unconsciousness. at last he recovered consciousness completely. this occurred at ten o’clock in the morning. at that hour, on clear days, the sun always passed over his right wall with a long stripe of light and lit up the corner next to the door. nastasya was standing near his bed along with one other person, who was completely unfamiliar to him and who was examining him with curiosity. he was a bearded young man wearing a caftan who resembled a member of some guild. the landlady was peering in from the half-opened door. raskolnikov raised himself up. “who’s that, nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man. “look at that, he’s come to!” she said. “he’s come to,” echoed the stranger. realizing that he had indeed come to, the landlady, who was peeking in from the doorway, closed it at once and hid. she was always shy and suffered conversations and explanations with difficulty; she was about forty, quite plump, with black brows and dark eyes; she was kind as a result of her stoutness and slowness; and she was even very pretty. she was more bashful than she needed to be. “who . . . are you?” he continued to ask, addressing the stranger. but at that"
dostoevsky,"moment, the door opened wide once more and in walked razumikhin, bending his head a bit because he was so tall. “it’s like a ship’s cabin,” he cried upon entering. “i always bang my head; and just think, it’s also called an apartment! and you, my friend, have you come to? i just learned about it from pashenka.” “he just came to,” said nastasya. “just came to,” echoed the stranger again, with a slight smile. “and just who might you be, sir?” razumikhin asked, suddenly turning to him. “i am, if you please, vrazumikhin, not razumikhin, as they all call me, * but vrazumikhin, a student, the son of a gentleman, and this fellow is my friend. well, sir, and who are you?” “i’m an agent in the office of the merchant shelopaev, sir, and i’m here on business, sir.” “be so good as to have a seat on this chair,” said razumikhin, taking a seat on the chair at the other end of the small table. “it’s a good thing you’ve come to, my friend,” he said, turning to raskolnikov. “you’ve hardly had anything to eat or drink in the last three days. true, you were given several spoonfuls of tea. i brought zosimov here to see you twice. do you remember him? he examined you carefully and said immediately that it was some nonsense—it all went to your head. some sort of nervous nonsense, spoiled food, he said, or not enough beer and horseradish, and that’s why you fell ill, but it was nothing serious, it would pass, and you’d soon be back on your feet. zosimov’s a fine fellow! he did a splendid job. well, sir, i won’t keep you any longer,” he said, turning to the agent. “would you care to clarify what you need? note, rodya, this is the second time someone’s come from that office, only the last time it wasn’t this man, but another one; he and i had a little talk. who was it who came before?” “that would’ve been two days ago, sir, exactly, sir. it was aleksey semyonovich; he also works in our office.” “and is he a little smarter than you are, do you think?” “yes, sir; he’s definitely more respectable, sir.” “commendable; well, sir, continue.” “well, through afanasy ivanovich vakhrushin, about whom, i assume, you have heard more than once, and according to your mother’s request, a money order has come for you through our office,” the agent began, addressing raskolnikov directly. “if you’re in complete control of your faculties, sir, i have thirty-five rubles to transfer to you, sir, since semyon semyonovich has received instructions from afanasy ivanovich, as he had previously, at your mother’s request. might you be knowing him, sir?” “yes . . . i remember . . . vakhrushin,” raskolnikov said pensively. “listen: he knows the merchant vakhrushin!” cried razumikhin. “who says he’s not in control of his faculties? i now see that you’re also an intelligent man. well, sir! it’s pleasant to hear such clever words.” “it’s the very same vakhrushin, sir, afanasy ivanovich, according to your mother’s request, who once sent you some money in a similar manner; he didn’t refuse to do it again this time, sir, and several days ago semyon semyonovich was informed that he should transfer thirty-five rubles to you, in anticipation of better times, sir.” “that phrase ‘in anticipation of better times’ is the best thing you’ve said so far; and the words about ‘your mother’ weren’t bad, either. well then, what’s your opinion: is he in complete control of his faculties or not?” “it seems so to me, sir. only there should be a signed receipt, sir.” “he’ll scrawl it! do you have a book for him to write in?” “yes, sir, i do have a book, sir.” “hand it over. well, rodya, sit up. i’ll support you; just scribble ‘raskolnikov’ for him; take the pen, because, my friend, money’s now sweeter than syrup.” “there’s no need,” said raskolnikov, pushing the pen away. “no need for what?” asked razumikhin. “i won’t sign it.” “what the hell? how can he do it without a signature?” “i don’t need any . . . money . . .” “you don’t need any money? you’re lying, my friend, i swear! don’t worry, please, he’s simply that way . . . his mind’s wandering again. besides, this sometimes happens even when he’s wide awake. . . . you’re a reasonable man; we’ll direct him—that is, we’ll simply guide his hand and he’ll sign. let’s do it . . .” “i can come some other time, sir.” “no, no; why trouble yourself again? you’re a reasonable man. . . . well, rodya, let’s not detain our guest. . . . you see, he’s waiting,” he said, earnestly preparing to guide raskolnikov’s hand. “let me alone, i’ll do it myself,” raskolnikov said; he took the pen and signed the book. the agent handed over the money and withdrew. “bravo! and now, my friend, would you like something to eat?” “i would,” replied raskolnikov. “is there any soup left?” “it’s left over from yesterday,” replied nastasya, who had been standing there all the while. “with potatoes and rice?” “with potatoes and rice.” “i know it by heart. bring some soup, and some tea, too.” “i will.” raskolnikov regarded everything with profound amazement and with slow-witted irrational terror. he decided to keep silent and wait: what would happen next? “it seems i’m not delirious,” he thought, “it seems that this is really happening . . .” two minutes later, nastasya returned with some soup and declared that tea would be ready shortly. there were two soup spoons, two bowls, and complete settings: a saltcellar, pepper shaker, mustard for the beef, and so on, the likes of which he hadn’t seen in quite some time. there was even a clean tablecloth. “it wouldn’t be bad, nastasyushka, if praskovya pavlovna were to order two bottles of beer. we’d drink it with pleasure.” “what a sly one you"
dostoevsky,"are!” muttered nastasya and went out to fulfill the request. raskolnikov continued staring wildly and anxiously. meanwhile, razumikhin sat down next to him on the sofa, clumsily, like a bear, and put his left arm around raskolnikov’s head, in spite of the fact that he could have raised his head by himself; with his right hand razumikhin carried a spoonful of soup to his mouth, first blowing on it several times beforehand to make sure he didn’t burn himself. though the soup was barely lukewarm, raskolnikov greedily swallowed a spoonful, then another, and a third. but after feeding him a few spoons, razumikhin suddenly stopped and announced that they would have to consult zosimov about what to do next. nastasya came in carrying two bottles of beer. “would you like some tea?” “i would,” raskolnikov replied. “bring us some quickly, nastasya, because i think he can have tea without consulting any medical authorities. and here’s the beer!” razumikhin sat down on his chair, reached for his bowl of soup, the beef, and began eating with such appetite as if he hadn’t eaten in the last three days. “i’ve been having dinner here like this for the last three days, my friend rodya,” he muttered, as best he could with his mouth filled with beef, “and it’s all thanks to your nice landlady, pashenka, who does me the honor of feeding me. of course, i don’t insist, but neither do i object. here’s nastasya with the tea. she’s so quick! nastenka, would you like some beer?” “what a naughty boy you are!” “some tea?” “tea, yes.” “pour it. wait, i’ll pour it for you; sit down at the table.” he took charge immediately, poured her tea, then poured another cup, forsook his own lunch, and sat down on the sofa again. as before, he put his left arm around the patient’s head, raised him up, and began to feed him teaspoons of tea, once again constantly and very diligently blowing on the spoon to cool the tea, as if the primary and most salutary point of the healing process consisted in this act of cooling. raskolnikov kept silent and didn’t resist, even though he felt he had sufficient strength to raise himself up and sit on the sofa without anyone’s assistance. he felt that he could also control his own hands, hold a spoon or a cup, and perhaps even walk on his own. but with some strange, almost animal cunning, it suddenly occurred to him to hide his strength for the time being, to conceal himself, if necessary, to pretend that he didn’t understand everything completely. meanwhile he would listen and try to determine what was happening. he was unable to master his revulsion, however: after swallowing down a dozen or so spoons of tea, he suddenly freed his head, stubbornly pushed the spoon away, and threw himself back on the pillow again. under his head now were some genuine pillows—down pillows with clean pillowcases; he noticed that, too, and took it into consideration. “pashenka should also send us up some raspberry jam today so i can make him a special drink,” said razumikhin, sitting back down in his place and returning to his own soup and beer. “where will she get raspberry jam for you?” asked nastasya, holding a saucer in her open hand and sipping her tea “through a lump of sugar.” † “raspberry jam, my dear, she can get in a shop. you see, rodya, a whole story has unfolded here without you. when you made off like a rascal from me and didn’t say where you lived, i was so angry that i resolved to find you and punish you. i began that same day. i walked and walked, asked and asked! i couldn’t recall this apartment because i’d never known about it. well, as for your previous apartment, i remembered only that it was at five corners, in kharlamov’s house. i searched and searched for that place—it turned out to be not in kharlamov’s, but bukh’s house—sometimes sounds get all confused! i was angry. i was so furious that the next day i went to the address bureau to give it a try, and what do you know, they located you in two minutes. you were registered there.” “registered!” “indeed! yet they couldn’t find general kobelev for someone who was looking for him. well, sir, it’s too long a story. as soon as i turned up here, i immediately learned about all your affairs; i know it all, my friend, everything; nastasya witnessed it all. i became acquainted with nikodim fomich, and they pointed out ilya petrovich to me, and the caretaker and mr. zametov (aleksandr grigorevich, the clerk in the local office), and, finally, even pashenka—that was the crowning achievement; and even she knows . . .” “he sweetened her up,” muttered nastasya, with a cunning smile. “you ought to put some sugar in your teacup, nastasya nikiforovna.” “you dog, you!” nastasya cried suddenly and burst out laughing. “besides, i’m petrovna, not nikiforovna,” she added suddenly, after she had stopped laughing. “we’ll keep that in mind, young lady. so then, my friend, so as not to go on too long, at first i wanted to unleash an electric current here throughout, in order to root out all the prejudices in this place at once; but pashenka was victorious. i never expected, my friend, that she’d be so . . . charming . . . eh? what do you think?” raskolnikov kept silent, although he didn’t lift his anxious gaze from his friend’s face even for a moment. he continued staring at him fixedly. “very charming, indeed,” continued razumikhin, not in the least flustered by his friend’s silence, as if assenting to the reply he received, “and even quite something, in all respects.” “you beast!” cried nastasya again, obviously deriving indescribable delight from this conversation. “it’s a shame, my friend, that you weren’t able to deal with this matter from the very beginning. you should"
dostoevsky,"have treated her differently. she is, so to speak, a most unexpected character! well, we’ll talk about her later. . . . but, for example, tell me how it came about that she dared to withhold your dinner? or, for example, that promissory note? were you out of your mind when you signed it? or, for example, that marriage proposal, when her daughter, natalya yegorovna, was still alive? i know everything! however, i see that it’s a delicate matter and i’m an ass; forgive me. but as far as stupidity’s concerned, don’t you agree, my friend, that praskovya pavlovna’s not as foolish as one might presume at first glance, eh?” “yes,” mumbled raskolnikov, looking to one side, but understanding that it was more advantageous to continue this conversation. “isn’t it true?” cried razumikhin, apparently overjoyed that he’d received an answer. “but she’s not too clever either, is she? she’s an absolutely, utterly unexpected character! i’m getting a bit flustered, my friend, i assure you. . . . she must be around forty years old. she claims she’s only thirty-six and has a right to say so. however, i swear that i’m judging her more intellectually, according to certain metaphysics; you see, my friend, we’ve established a symbolic relationship, something like your algebra! i don’t understand a thing! well, it’s all nonsense, but when she realized that you were no longer a student, that you’d lost all your pupils and shed your decent apparel and, with the death of her daughter, that there was no longer any reason to keep supporting you as a member of the family, well, she suddenly got scared. then, since you took refuge in your little room and didn’t keep on as before, she decided to throw you out of the apartment. she’s been harboring this intention for some time but didn’t want to forfeit that promissory note. and besides, you yourself also assured her that your mother would pay up . . .” “i said that as a mean trick. . . . my mother’s almost reduced to begging alms. . . . i lied so i could keep my room and . . . my board,” raskolnikov stated loudly and distinctly. “yes, you did the sensible thing. but the point is that a certain mr. chebarov turned up, a court councillor and a very businesslike man. pashenka couldn’t conceive of any of this on her own; she’s very shy. but this businesslike man was not reserved in the least. the first thing he did was to pose a question: was there any hope of payment on that promissory note? the answer was yes, because you have the sort of mother who, with her pension of one hundred and twenty-five rubles, even if she herself didn’t have anything to eat, would still send it to her rodenka. you also have the sort of sister who would sell herself into slavery for her brother. he was counting on this. . . . why are you getting restless? now, my friend, i’ve found out all there is to know about you; it was not for nothing that you confided to pashenka when you were still on good terms with her, and now i’m speaking out of love. . . . here’s the thing: an honest, sensitive man confides in a friend, while a businesslike man listens but keeps on eating, and then devours the other person. so she hands the promissory note over to this chebarov in payment for something, and he lodges a formal claim, and won’t be put off. when i found out, i wanted to unleash a current through him, too, to clear my conscience, but at the time i had harmonious relations with pashenka and settled the whole matter, at its very source, by guaranteeing that you’d pay. i vouched for you, friend, do you hear? we summoned chebarov, shoved ten rubles in his mouth, got the note back, and now i have the honor of presenting it to you—they’ll take your word for it now—here, take it; i’ve even torn it a bit like it’s supposed to be.” razumikhin placed the acknowledgment of debt on the table. when raskolnikov looked at it without saying a word and then turned toward the wall, even razumikhin was a little annoyed. “i see, my friend,” he said a minute later, “that i’ve made a fool of myself once again. i thought i could distract you and entertain you with my chatter, but it seems that i merely aroused your anger.” “was it you i didn’t recognize when i was delirious?” asked raskolnikov, after keeping silent for a minute and not turning his head around. “yes, me, and you even became frantic because i brought zametov here with me once.” “zametov? the clerk? why?” raskolnikov turned around quickly and stared directly at razumikhin. “what’s the matter? what are you so upset about? he wanted to make your acquaintance; he and i had talked a lot about you. . . . otherwise, from whom could i have found out so much about you? he’s a fine man, my friend, most wonderful . . . in his own way, of course. we’re friends now; we see each other almost every day. i’ve moved into this part of town. did you know that? i just moved. i’ve been to laviza’s place with him a few times. you remember her, laviza ivanovna?” “did i say anything when i was delirious?” “i’ll say you did! you weren’t yourself, sir.” “what did i say?” “good lord, what a question! what did you say? it’s well known what a fellow raves about in his delirium. . . . well, my friend, now, so as not to lose time, let’s get down to business.” he stood up from the chair and grabbed his cap. “what did i say?” “you’re harping on the same thing! are you afraid you revealed some secret? don’t worry: nothing was divulged about the countess. ‡ but much was said"
dostoevsky,"about a bulldog, earrings, some chains, krestovsky island, a courtyard, nikodim fomich, and ilya petrovich, the assistant to the superintendent. besides that, you were interested in your sock, very much so! you kept whining: give it to me, you said, that’s all i want. zametov looked in all the corners of your room to find your socks and gave them to you with his own hands scented with cologne and decked out in rings. only then did you calm down; you clutched that junk in your hands day and night; it was impossible to get them away from you. they must still be lying somewhere under your blanket. and you asked for the fringes from your trousers, in such a tearful voice! we tried to determine what sort of fringes you wanted. but it was impossible to figure that out. . . . well, sir, let’s get down to business! here are your thirty-five rubles; i’ll take ten of them and pre­sent you with an account in about two hours. at the same time, i’ll let zosimov know, although he should have been here a while ago, since it’s already past eleven. and you, nastenka, look in on him more often in my absence, to see if he wants something more to drink or anything else . . . i’ll speak with pashenka myself and tell her what’s needed. good-bye!” “he calls her pashenka! oh, you sly dog, you!” nastasya said as he was leaving; then she opened the door and began listening, but couldn’t refrain from running downstairs. she very much wanted to find out what he was talking about with the landlady because she was completely enamored with razumikhin. as soon as the door closed after her, the sick man tossed off his blanket and jumped out of bed like a madman. he’d been waiting with ardent, feverish impatience for them to leave so he could get to work in private. but what should he do, what sort of work? it was as if now, intentionally, he had forgotten. “good lord! tell me only one thing: do they know about everything or not? what if they know already and they’re merely pretending, teasing me while i’m lying here, and then all of a sudden they’ll come in and say that it’s all been known for some time and that they were simply waiting. . . . what should i do now? i forgot, as if on purpose; i remembered a moment ago, but then i suddenly forgot!” he stood in the middle of his room and looked around in tormented bewilderment. he went to the door, opened it, and listened; but that wasn’t it. suddenly, as if recalling, he rushed to the corner where there was a hole in the wallpaper and began to examine it; he thrust his hand into the hole, felt around, but that wasn’t it, either. he went to the stove, opened it, and began searching in the cinders: pieces of the trouser fringes and fragments of his torn pockets were lying inside, just as they had been when he’d thrown them in there: this meant that no one had looked inside! then he remembered his sock, which razumikhin had just mentioned. true, it was still lying on the sofa under his blanket, but it was so worn and dirty that of course zametov couldn’t have noticed anything in particular about it. “bah, zametov! the office! why did they summon me to the office? where’s the summons? bah! i’m all mixed up; that was then! that was when i was examining my sock, but now . . . now i’ve been ill. why did zametov drop in to see me? why did razumikhin bring him here?” he muttered weakly, sitting down on his bed once more. “what’s all this? is this my delirium continuing or is this real? it seems to be really happening. . . . ah, now i remember: to run away! to run away quickly, immediately, to run away immediately! yes . . . but where? where are my clothes? i have no boots. they’ve carried them off! hidden them! i understand! ah, there’s my coat—they overlooked it! here’s the money on the table, thank heavens! here’s the promissory note. . . . i’ll take the money and go away; i’ll rent another apartment, and they’ll never find me! yes, but what about the address bureau? they’ll find me! razumikhin will find me. it’s better to run away completely . . . far away . . . to america, and the hell with them! and take the promissory note . . . it’ll be useful there. what else should i take? they think i’m sick! they don’t even know i can walk, ha, ha, ha! i guessed from their eyes that they know everything! all i have to do is go down the stairs! what if they have a policeman standing guard? what’s this? tea? and there’s some beer left, half a bottle, and it’s cold.” he grabbed the bottle in which there was still about a glass left and swallowed it in one large gulp with pleasure, as if he were putting out a fire in his breast. but a minute hadn’t passed before the beer had gone to his head and a slight, even pleasant chill ran up and down his spine. he lay down and pulled the blanket over himself. his thoughts, already painful and incoherent, began to get more and more confused, and soon a light, pleasant sleep came over him. with delight his head located a place on the pillow and he wrapped himself up tightly in the soft cotton blanket, which was now covering him instead of his torn overcoat; he sighed softly and fell into a deep, sound, healing sleep. he woke up when he heard that someone had come in. he opened his eyes and he saw razumikhin, who had opened the door wide and was standing on the threshold trying to decide"
dostoevsky,"whether to enter or not. raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and looked at him, as if trying desperately to remember something. “ah, you’re not asleep; well, here i am! nastasya, bring the bundle up here!” razumikhin yelled down the stairs. “you’ll have the account right away . . .” “what time is it?” asked raskolnikov, glancing around anxiously. “you had a good sleep, my friend: it’s evening now, almost six o’clock. you slept for over six hours . . .” “good lord! how could i?” “what’s the problem? it’s good for you! what’s the hurry? do you have a rendezvous? we have all the time in the world. i’ve been waiting for you for about three hours; i looked in twice, but you were asleep. i went to call on zosimov twice, but he wasn’t in and that’s that! never mind: he’ll come! i also attended to my own affairs. i’ve moved today, completely, with my uncle. i have an uncle living with me now. . . . well, the hell with all that, let’s get down to business! give me that bundle, nastenka. we just now. . . . hey, friend, how do you feel?” “fine. i’m not sick. . . . razumikhin, have you been here long?” “i said i’ve been waiting three hours.” “no, before that.” “what do you mean?” “when did you start coming here?” “i told you all this before, don’t you remember?” raskolnikov became thoughtful. what had happened before seemed like a dream to him. he couldn’t remember it on his own, and he looked questioningly at razumikhin. “hmm,” razumikhin said. “you forgot! just a little while ago it occurred to me that you still weren’t quite right. . . . now you’re feeling better with the sleep. . . . really, you look much better. splendid! well, let’s get down to business! you’ll recall it soon. look here, my dear friend.” he began to untie the bundle, which apparently interested him greatly. “this, my friend, believe me, is something that lies very close to my heart. we must make a man out of you. let’s begin: we’ll start at the top. do you see this cap?” he began, taking from the bundle a rather nice but at the same time very ordinary and inexpensive service cap. “will you try it on?” “later, afterward,” said raskolnikov, waving it away peevishly. “no, rodya, my dear, don’t resist, because it’ll be too late; i won’t sleep all night, because i bought it merely guessing your size. perfect!” he exclaimed triumphantly, after seeing it on raskolnikov’s head. “an excellent fit! headwear, my friend, is the first item in one’s apparel, a kind of introduction. my acquaintance tolstyakov, whenever he enters some public place where others are standing around wearing their hats and caps, feels compelled to doff his hat. everyone thinks that he’s doing it out of servility, but it’s simply because he’s ashamed of the bird’s nest he has on his head: he’s easily ashamed! well, nastenka, here are two different hats: this palmerston” § —he retrieved from the corner raskolnikov’s mangled round top hat, which, for some reason, he called a palmerston—“and this splendid item. take a guess, rodya; how much do you think i paid for it? what about you, nastasyushka?” he asked, turning to her, seeing that raskolnikov remained silent. “i think you paid twenty kopecks for it,” nastasya replied. “twenty kopecks! you silly girl!” he cried, offended. “i couldn’t even buy you for twenty kopecks these days—eighty kopecks! and that’s only because it’s been worn before. true, it comes with a guarantee: if you wear this one out, they give you a new one next year at no cost, so help me god! well, sir, now let’s go to the united slacks of america, as we used to say in school. i warn you—i’m proud of these trousers!” he laid out in front of raskolnikov a pair of gray slacks made of a light summer wool: “with no holes, no stains, perfectly passable, though a bit worn, with a matching vest of the same color, as fashion dictates. and that it’s been worn makes it even better: it’s softer, nicer. . . . you see, rodya, to make a career for oneself in society, one must always pay attention to the season; if you don’t order asparagus in january, then you can hold on to a few rubles in your wallet; it’s the same with regard to these purchases. it’s now the summer season, and i bought some summer clothes because autumn will require warmer clothes, so you’ll have to discard these . . . all the more so since these things will have fallen to pieces by then, if not from their increased splendor, then from internal defects. well, so what do you think? how much did i pay? two rubles and twenty-five kopecks! and remember, it’s with the same guarantee: if you wear these out, next year you get others for no charge! that’s the way it works in fedyaev’s shop: you pay one time only, and that’s sufficient for the rest of your life, otherwise you’d never return there again. well, sir, now let’s get to the boots—what do you think? you can see that they’ve been worn, but they’ll do you for the next two months or so, because the material and the workmanship are foreign. the secretary of the english embassy sold them at the flea market last week; he wore them only six days, but he really needed some cash. the price was one ruble and fifty kopecks. good, eh?” “maybe they won’t fit!” remarked nastasya. “won’t fit? and what’s this?” he took from his pocket raskolnikov’s old, stiff boot, covered with dried mud and riddled with holes. “i took this monstrosity along in reserve, and they were able to determine the correct size. all of this business went smoothly. but as far as his linen’s concerned, i spoke with the landlady. in the"
dostoevsky,"first place, here are three shirts, coarse cotton, but with fashionable fronts. . . . and so, in all: eighty kopecks for the cap, two rubles and twenty-five kopecks for the rest of the clothes, for a total of three rubles and five kopecks; one ruble and fifty kopecks for the boots—because they’re very fine boots—for a total of four rubles and fifty-five kopecks, plus five rubles for all the linen—i paid the wholesale price—for a grand total of nine rubles and fifty-five kopecks. i have forty-five kopecks change: here, please take these five-kopeck coins. thus, rodya, all your clothes have been renewed, because, in my opinion, your overcoat is not only still serviceable, but even has a kind of elegance about it: that’s what happens when you order your clothes from charmeur’s tailor shop! and as for socks and the remaining items, i leave that to you; we still have twenty-five rubles, and don’t you worry about paying pashenka the rent for the apartment; i told her your credit was limitless. and now, my friend, please let me change your linen, because some illness may still be lingering in that shirt of yours.” “leave me alone! i don’t want to!” raskolnikov said, brushing him aside, after listening with disgust to the strained playfulness of his account of the purchase of the clothes . . . “hey, friend, this is impossible; why have i been wearing my boots out?” razumikhin insisted. “nastasyushka, don’t be embarrassed, help me; that’s right!” and, in spite of raskolnikov’s resistance, he managed to change his linen. raskolnikov fell back on his pillow and for about two minutes said not one word. “why won’t they go away and leave me alone?” he thought. “what money did you use to buy all this?” he asked at last, staring at the wall. “money? how do you like that? your own money. the agent was here a while ago, from vakhrushin’s office. your mama sent it to you; or did you forget that, too?” “now i remember,” said raskolnikov, after some minutes of sullen reflection. razumikhin frowned and regarded him uneasily. the door opened and in walked a tall, solidly built man who looked somewhat familiar to raskolnikov. “zosimov! at last!” cried razumikhin joyfully. * see names of principal characters. † russians often sweeten their tea by placing a lump of sugar between their teeth and drinking tea “through” it. ‡ probably a reference to aleksandr pushkin’s (–) most famous short story, “the queen of spades” (). § palmerston (–) was a british statesman and liberal prime minister. oceanofpdf.com iv z osimov, a tall, plump man, with a puffy, pale, colorless, smooth-shaven face and straight blond hair, wore glasses and had a large gold ring on one of his fat, swollen fingers. he was about twenty-seven years old. he was dressed in a large, light, fashionable coat and light-colored summer trousers. in general, everything he wore was large, dandyish, and impeccable; his linen was spotless and his watch chain was massive. his manner was slow, as if both sluggish and, at the same time, intentionally easygoing; his pretentiousness, though carefully concealed, was apparent at every moment. everyone who knew him found this man difficult to deal with but acknowledged that he knew his business. “i came by to see you twice, my friend. . . . you see, he’s come to!” razumikhin said. “i see, i see; well, and just how are we feeling now, eh?” zosimov asked, addressing raskolnikov, staring at him directly and seating himself next to him at the foot of the sofa, where he made himself as comfortable as possible. “he’s still feeling down,” razumikhin continued. “we just changed his linen, and he almost started crying.” “that makes sense; his linen could’ve been changed later, if he didn’t want it. . . . his pulse is strong. you still have a little headache, don’t you?” “i’m fine, completely fine!” raskolnikov replied insistently and irritably, suddenly raising himself on the sofa, his eyes flashing; then he fell back onto the pillow again and turned his face to the wall. zosimov observed him carefully. “very well . . . everything’s in order,” he said sluggishly. “has he had anything to eat?” they told him and then asked what he should be fed. “anything. . . . soup, tea. . . . no mushrooms or cucumbers, of course, and he shouldn’t have any beef, and . . . but why sit here chatting like this?” he exchanged glances with razumikhin. “no more medicine or anything; i’ll look in again tomorrow. . . . perhaps even later today . . . well, yes . . .” “i’ll take him out for a walk tomorrow evening!” decided razumikhin. “to the yusupov garden, and then we’ll drop by the palais de cristal.” * “i wouldn’t move him at all tomorrow, but perhaps you can, a little. . . . we’ll see then.” “what a pity, i’m having a housewarming today, very close to here; i wish he could come. he could lie there on the sofa among us! will you be there?” razumikhin suddenly turned to ask zosimov. “don’t forget, you promised.” “perhaps later, if i can. what have you arranged?” “nothing much: tea, vodka, and herring. we’ll serve a savory pie—just a few friends.” “who, exactly?” “they’re all from around here. true, they’re all new acquaintances—except for my old uncle, and he’s a new acquaintance, too; he just arrived in petersburg yesterday, on some sort of business. we see each other once every five years.” “who is he?” “he’s been vegetating his whole life as a district postmaster. . . . he receives a small pension; he’s sixty-five and hardly worth talking about. . . . but i do love him. porfiry petrovich will also be there; he’s the local examining magistrate . . . a trained lawyer. you know him . . .” “is he also a relative of yours?” zosimov inquired. “a very distant one; why are you"
dostoevsky,"making such a face? just because you two had words once, does that mean you won’t come?” “i don’t give a damn about him . . .” “that’s even better. there’ll be some students, a teacher, a civil servant, a musician, an officer, zametov . . .” razumikhin continued. “tell me, please, what do you have in common or does he have”—zosimov nodded at raskolnikov—“with this zametov?” “oh, these squeamish people! principles! you’re stuck on your principles as if on loaded springs; you don’t dare turn around on your own; in my opinion, he’s a good man—that’s the principle, and i don’t want to hear anything else. zametov’s a splendid man.” “he greases his palms.” “well, what if he does? i don’t give a damn. what of it, anyway?” razumikhin cried suddenly, somehow unusually annoyed. “did i praise him for greasing his palms? i merely said that in his own way he was a good man! and i ask you directly, look around at everyone—are there really that many good men left? i’m sure that no one would give even a baked onion for me, even if you threw in all my entrails, and that’s only if you were included in the bargain, too!” “that’s too little; i’d give two onions for you . . .” “well, i’d give only one for you! go on, be witty! zametov’s still a young lad. i’ll still pull him by the hair, because he should be drawn in and not pushed away. once you push a man away, you can’t make him any better, all the more so with a young man. one has to be twice as careful with such a lad. hey, you progressive blockheads, you don’t understand a thing! if you don’t respect others, you harm yourself. . . . if you want to know, it was perhaps a shared interest that brought us together.” “i would like to know.” “it all has to do with that painter, that is, the housepainter. . . . we’ll drag him out! however, there’s no difficulty now. the matter’s completely clear! we have to turn up the steam.” “what painter are you talking about?” “what, didn’t i tell you? no? wait a bit, i told you only the beginning . . . about the murder of the old woman, the pawnbroker, the civil servant’s widow. . . . well, now there’s a painter involved in it . . .” “i heard about that murder before you told me, and i’m very interested in it . . . in part . . . for one reason . . . and i read about it in the papers! but now . . .” “they also killed lizaveta!” nastasya blurted out suddenly, turning to raskolnikov. she had remained in the room, standing near the door, listening. “lizaveta?” mumbled raskolnikov, in a barely audible voice. “lizaveta, the trader, or don’t you know? she used to come here downstairs. once she mended a shirt for you.” raskolnikov turned toward the wall and the soiled yellow wallpaper with little white flowers; he chose one ungainly white flower with some little brown lines and began staring at it: how many leaves did it have, how many serrations on each leaf, how many brown lines? he felt that his arms and legs had grown numb, as if they were paralyzed, but he didn’t try to move. he just stared intently at the flower. “so what about the painter?” zosimov interrupted nastasya’s chatter with a certain displeasure. she sighed and fell silent. “they consider him a suspect in the murder!” razumikhin continued heatedly. “what sort of evidence do they have?” “the hell with evidence! that’s just it: the evidence they have isn’t really evidence; that’s what we have to prove! it’s exactly what happened at first when they rounded up and accused those two, what are their names . . . kokh and pestryakov. phew! it’s all so stupid, even loathsome to a person who has nothing to do with it! that pestryakov may come to see me today. . . . by the way, rodya, you already know about this; this happened before you fell ill, precisely the day you fainted in the office where they were talking about it . . .” zosimov regarded raskolnikov with curiosity, but he didn’t stir. “you know what, razumikhin? i’ve been watching you: what a busybody you are,” remarked zosimov. “that may be, but all the same we’ll get him out of it!” cried razumikhin, banging his fist on the table. “what’s the worst part of it? it’s not that they’re lying. one can always forgive that kind of lie, because it always leads to the truth. no, what’s so annoying is that they’re lying and believe their own lies. i respect porfiry, but. . . . what was it, for example, that led them astray from the very start? the door was locked, but when they arrived with the caretaker, the door was unlocked. well, that means kokh and pestryakov murdered them! that’s their logic!” “don’t get so upset. they’ve simply detained them, but one shouldn’t assume. . . . by the way, i’ve met this fellow kokh. it turns out he’d been buying up unredeemed pledges from the old woman. eh?” “what a scoundrel he is! he also buys up promissory notes. he’s a businessman. to hell with him! do you understand what it is that angers me most? it’s their obsolete, vulgar, callous routine. . . . yet here, in this case, one could adopt a whole new approach. using only psychological facts, one could show how to follow the right path. ‘but,’ they say, ‘we have the facts.’ but facts aren’t everything. at least half the case is how well one treats the facts!” “and do you know how to treat facts?” zosimov asked. “it’s impossible to keep silent when you feel—you feel by instinct—that you could help in this case, if only. . . . hey! do you know"
dostoevsky,"the details?” “i’m waiting to hear about the painter.” “well, of course! then listen to the story: exactly three days after the murder, in the morning, they were still fussing over kokh and pestryakov, even though those two were able to account for their every step. the evidence was unmistakable! all of a sudden, the most unexpected fact was announced. a certain peasant named dushkin, the keeper of a tavern opposite that same building, appears in the office and brings in a jewelry case with gold earrings and tells a whole long tale: ‘a fellow comes runnin’ in two days ago,’ he says, ‘toward evenin’, just after eight o’clock.’ you hear? the day and the hour! ‘a painter who’d come to see me before durin’ the day; his name is mikolai, and he brings in this here box of gold earrin’s with little gemstones, and asks for two rubles in exchange. when i ask him where he got ’em, he says he’d found ’em in the street. i didn’t ask him any more about it’—that’s dushkin speaking—‘and i gave him a note, that is, a ruble, because i thought if he didn’t get it from me, he’d get it from someone else, it’s all the same—he’ll drink it up, so it’s better for it to be in my hands: “safe find, fast find,” as they say, and if somethin’ comes out about it, then i could always turn it in.’ well, of course, he’s spinning an old wives’ tale, lying like a dog, because i know this dushkin. he’s a pawnbroker himself and is hiding stolen property. he didn’t filch this thirty-ruble item from mikolai just to ‘turn it in.’ he simply lost his nerve. well, to hell with it, you hear. dushkin continues: ‘i know this here peasant mikolai dementev from his childhood; he’s from our district and province, zaraysk, and i’m from ryazan. and though mikolai isn’t a drunkard, he does drink, and i knew he was workin’ in this here house, paintin’, together with mitrei, and they’re both from the same place. after he gets the ruble, he changes it for some coins right away, downs two glasses of vodka, takes his change, leaves, but i didn’t see mitrei with him at that time. the next day we hear that alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna had been killed with an axe. we knew them, sir, and i begin worryin’ about them earrin’s because we knew that the dead woman lent money for pledges. i went to see them in that house and began askin’ questions, carefully and quietly. the very first one i asked was ‘is mikolai here?’ mitrei told me that mikolai’d gone off on a spree, had come home drunk at dawn, stayed for about ten minutes, and then left again. mitrei hadn’t seen him since and was finishin’ up the work alone. they were workin’ on the second floor of the same staircase as the deceased. after hearin’ all this, i didn’t say nothing to nobody at the time’—that’s dushkin speaking—‘but i found out everythin’ i could about the murder and went back home with the same worries. this mornin’, at eight o’clock’—that is, on the third day, you understand—‘i see that mikolai’s comin’ to see me, not sober, but not really dead drunk, so he could still understand conversation. he sits down on the bench and keeps silent. besides him in the tavern at that time there was only one stranger, another man was asleep on the bench whom i knew, and my two boys. “did you,” i ask, “see mitrei?” “no,” he says, “i didn’t.” “and he wasn’t here?” “no,” he says, “not in the last two days.” “where did he sleep last night?” “in the sands,” † he says, “near kolomna.” “and where,” i say, “did you get those earrings?” “i found ’em in the street,” and he says this with some uncertainty, without looking at me. “have you heard,” i ask, “that such and such happened at that same time on that very evening on that staircase?” “no,” he says, “i didn’t.” he listens to me, his eyes wide open, and suddenly grows pale as a ghost. as i’m telling him all this, i see him reach for his cap and get ready to bolt. i wanted to keep him there; “wait, mikolai,” i say, “won’t you drink up?” i winked to my lad so he’d keep the door closed, and i came out from behind the counter; but he got away from me, ran out onto the street, down the lane—and that’s the last i saw of him. that settled all my doubts; he’s the culprit, no doubt about it . . .’ ” “i’ll say!” cried zosimov. “wait! hear the end of it! of course, they set off as fast as possible to find mikolai. they detained dushkin and searched his place, mitrei’s, too; they scoured the men in kolomna as well—suddenly, two days ago, they bring in mikolai himself: he’d been detained near the gate of an inn. he’d arrived there, removed his cross, a silver one, and asked for a glass of vodka in exchange. they gave it to him. after waiting a few minutes, the old woman went into the cowshed and peeked through the crack. in the barn next door he’d fastened his sash to a beam, made a noose, then he stood on a stump and was trying to put the noose around his neck. the old woman shrieked at the top of her lungs and they came running: ‘so, that’s what you are!’ ‘take me,’ he says, ‘to such and such a police station; i’ll admit to everything.’ well, they took him to the police station, the one here, that is, with all the appropriate honors. then it was this, that, who, how, how old—‘twenty-two’—so on and so forth. question: ‘when you were working with mitrei, did you see anyone on the staircase, at such and such an hour?’ answer:"
dostoevsky,"‘of course, some people may have gone by, but we didn’t notice who.’ ‘did you hear anything, some noise or anything else?’ ‘we didn’t hear nothin’ unusual.’ ‘did you know, mikolai, a certain widow and her sister on that day and at that time were murdered and robbed?’ ‘i don’t know nothin’ and don’t have no idea. the first i heard was from afanasy pavlych, the third day, in the tavern.’ ‘where did you get the earrings?’ ‘i found ’em in the street.’ ‘why didn’t you come to work with mitrei the next day?’ ‘i was on a spree.’ ‘where was that?’ ‘here and there.’ ‘why did you run away from dushkin?’ ‘’cause i was very afraid.’ ‘afraid of what?’ ‘they’d think i done it.’ ‘how could you be afraid when you yourself felt you were not guilty?’ well, zosimov, believe it or not, that question was posed, in those exact words. i know it for a fact. they told me so. how do you like that?” “well, no; but there are certainly clues.” “i’m not talking about clues now. i’m talking about that question, how they themselves understand things! to hell with it! well, they pressured him and pressured him, squeezed him and squeezed him, and he finally confessed. ‘i found ’em not on the street,’ he says, ‘but in the ’partment where mitrei and i was paintin’.’ ‘how did you find them?’ ‘it’s that mitrei and i was paintin’ there the whole day, until eight o’clock, and we was fixin’ to leave, and mitrei takes a brush and daubs some paint on my face, he does, he daubs some paint on my face, and goes runnin’ out and i run after him. so i go runnin’ after him, yellin’ my head off. as i was comin’ down the stairs and turnin’ into the gateway at full speed, i run right into the caretaker with some other gentlemen, i don’t remember exactly how many, and the caretaker begins shoutin’ at me, and the other gentleman also begins shoutin’ ’cause me and mitka are blockin’ the way. then i grab mitka by the hair and knock him down and start punchin’ him. mitka, too, from underneath, grabs me by the hair and starts punchin’ me, and we’re fightin’ not out of anger, but out of love, playin’. then mitka breaks free and goes runnin’ out into the street and i chase after him, but don’t catch up with him, and go back to the ’partment alone—’cause i have to clean up. i begin to clear things away and wait for mitrei, in case he comes. by the door in the entranceway to the room, in the corner against the wall, i step on a small box. i look down, and there’s somethin’ lyin’ there, wrapped in paper. i pick it up, and i see some tiny hooks, and i take hold of these hooks and there’s earrin’s in the little box . . .’ ” “behind the door? lying behind the door? behind the door?” raskolnikov cried suddenly, regarding razumikhin with a vague, frightened look, raising himself up slowly, leaning on his arm on the sofa. “what of it? what’s wrong with you? why do you ask?” razumikhin also rose from his place. “it’s nothing!” raskolnikov replied, barely audibly, lowering himself onto his pillow again and turning to face the wall. everyone was silent for a little while. “he must have dozed off; he’s only half awake,” razumikhin said at last, looking inquisitively at zosimov, who shook his head slightly to indicate no. “well, go on,” said zosimov. “then what?” “then what? as soon as he saw the earrings, he forgot all about the apartment and about mitka, grabbed his cap, ran off to dushkin, and, as is known, received a ruble from him, lying to him, saying that he found them in the street, and then he went off on a spree. about the murder, he confirmed what he’d said before: ‘i don’t know nothing and don’t have no idea; i heard about it only two days ago.’ ‘why didn’t you come in before this?’ ‘i was afraid.’ ‘why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘from thinkin’.’ ‘thinking about what?’ ‘they’d think i done it.’ that’s the whole story. now, what do you suppose they made of all that?” “what’s to think about? there’s a trail, not much of one, but something. facts. don’t tell me they should release your painter?” “but now they attribute the murder to him without question. they already have no doubt whatsoever . . .” “not true. you’re getting too excited. what about the earrings? you have to agree that if on that very day and at that time the earrings from the old woman’s trunk wound up in nikolai’s hands—you have to agree that they had to get there some way or other. in such circumstances that must mean something.” “how did they wind up there? how?” cried razumikhin. “could it be that you, doctor, you, who, first of all, are obliged to study human nature, and you, who have the opportunity, more than most, to observe human nature, could it be that with all this evidence, you don’t see what sort of creature this nikolai is? don’t you see that from the very beginning everything he said during the interrogations was the sacred truth? that’s precisely how the earrings wound up in his hands, just as he said. he stepped on the box and then picked them up!” “sacred truth? but he himself has admitted that he lied at first?” “listen to me, and listen carefully: the caretaker, kokh, pestryakov, another gentleman, the caretaker’s wife, and the woman who was sitting with her in the lodge at the time, and the court councillor kryukov, who, at that very moment, got out of a cab and entered through the gateway, arm in arm with a woman—everyone, that is eight or ten witnesses, unanimously testify that nikolai had pushed dmitry down on the ground"
dostoevsky,"and was lying on top of him, punching him, while he had grabbed hold of nikolai’s hair and was also punching him. they were stretched across the path, blocking their way; people were swearing at them from all sides; they were on top of one another ‘like little kids’ (the actual expression used by the witnesses), screeching, fighting, and laughing, each trying to outdo the other with his laughter, making the funniest faces. then, just like children, they went running out into the street, each trying to catch the other. you hear? now, take careful note of this: the bodies upstairs were still warm, you hear, still warm, when they found them! if they had killed the two women, or if just nikolai had done it, broken into and robbed the trunk, or merely taken part somehow in the robbery, then let me pose just one question to you: does their mental disposition—that is, with their screeches, laughter, childish fighting under the gate—correspond to axes, blood, criminal cunning, caution, and robbery? they had just murdered them, some five or ten minutes ago—because, it turns out, the bodies were still warm—and suddenly, leaving the bodies, the apartment unlocked, and knowing that some men had just gone up there, abandoning their booty, they roll around in the road like little kids, laughing, attracting considerable attention from the ten witnesses who testify to this unanimously!” “of course, it’s odd! naturally, it’s impossible, but . . .” zosimov remarked. “no, my friend, no but . if the earrings, which turned up in nikolai’s hands on that very day and at that time, really constitute the most important factual evidence against him—though perfectly explicable according to his own testimony, consequently, still disputable evidence —then one must consider the exculpatory evidence, all the more so since there are irresistible facts. what do you think, judging by the nature of our legal system: will they accept such facts, are they even capable of accepting them—based exclusively on a psychological impossibility, on their mental disposition—as irresistible facts obliterating all accusatory and material evidence, no matter what they are? no, they won’t accept them, not for anything, because they found the box and the man wanted to kill himself, ‘which couldn’t happen, if he hadn’t felt that he was guilty!’ that’s the major question, that’s why i’m so excited! understand?” “yes, i can see you’re excited. wait, i forgot to ask: has it been proven that the box with the earrings really came from the old woman’s trunk?” “it has been,” razumikhin replied, frowning, and added, as if reluctantly, “kokh recognized the item and positively identified the person who’d pawned it, and he verified that the item was really his.” “that’s not good. now, one more thing: did anyone see nikolai at the time that kokh and pestryakov were heading upstairs? couldn’t that prove something?” zosimov asked. “that’s just it. no one saw him,” replied razumikhin with annoyance. “that’s what’s bad. even kokh and pestryakov didn’t notice him as they were passing by, although their testimony doesn’t mean very much now. ‘we saw,’ they said, ‘that the apartment was open, and that someone must have been working there, but in passing we didn’t pay any attention and don’t recall precisely whether there were workers inside at the time.’ ” “hmm. therefore, the only exculpatory evidence is that they were punching each other and laughing. let’s suppose this is serious proof, but. . . . now, how do you account for all these facts? how do you explain his finding the earrings, if he really found them as he maintains?” “how? what’s to explain: it’s perfectly clear! at least the path this investigation must follow is clear and indicated, and it’s the box that’s shown the way. the real murderer dropped those earrings. the murderer was upstairs when kokh and pestryakov knocked, standing behind the locked door. kokh was a fool and went downstairs. then the murderer slipped out and ran downstairs, too, because he had no other way out. on the staircase he hid from kokh, pestryakov, and the caretaker in the empty apartment exactly when dmitry and nikolai had run out. he stood behind the door while the caretaker and the others passed. he waited until the sound of their footsteps had died down, then proceeded downstairs on his own very quietly, at the same time that dmitry and nikolai ran out into the street and everyone dispersed, leaving no one left under the gateway. they might even have seen him, but they didn’t notice him since lots of people pass by there. he’d dropped the box from his pocket when he was standing behind the door and didn’t notice that he’d done so. he had more important things on his mind. the box clearly demonstrates that he stood right there. that’s all there is to it!” “clever! no, my friend, it is clever. but it’s too clever by half!” zosimov exclaimed. “why do you think so, why?” “because it all comes together too neatly . . . and it all works out . . . as if in the theater.” “hey!” razumikhin started to exclaim, but just at that moment the door opened and in walked a new person, unknown to everyone in the room. * a tavern named after the crystal palace, a structure built of cast iron and plate glass in hyde park, london, to house the great exhibition of . † an area between nevsky prospect and the smolny institute. oceanofpdf.com v t his was a gentleman, no longer young, but standoffish, portly, and with a cautious, grumpy face, who began by pausing in the doorway and glancing around as though offended and with undisguised astonishment, as if asking, with the look in his eyes, “where on earth have i come?” he surveyed raskolnikov’s cramped and shabby “ship’s cabin” with uncertainty, even with the pretense of a certain fright, almost as though taking offense. with that same astonishment, he transferred his glance and stared"
dostoevsky,"at raskolnikov himself, undressed, disheveled, unwashed, lying on his filthy, wretched sofa, also examining him without stirring. then, with the same deliberation, he began scrutinizing the disheveled, unshaven, uncombed figure of razumikhin, who stared directly into his eyes with a boldly inquisitive look without stirring from his place. a tense silence lasted a minute or so, until finally, as could be expected, there occurred a slight change of mood. it must have been that after certain extremely harsh facts caused him to realize that his exaggerated severe bearing here, in this “ship’s cabin,” would not get him anywhere, the gentleman softened his approach and politely, though not without some severity, turned to zosimov and, enunciating every syllable of his question, asked: “are you rodion romanovich raskolnikov, a student or former student?” zosimov stirred slowly and might have replied, had not razumikhin, whom no one had addressed, forestalled him immediately: “there he is on the sofa! what do you want?” that familiar “what do you want?” brought the standoffish gentleman up short; he almost turned to face razumikhin, but managed to restrain himself in time and turned back to zosimov. “there’s raskolnikov,” muttered zosimov, nodding at the patient. then he yawned and, in so doing, opened his mouth unusually wide and kept it that way for an unusually long time. next, he slowly reached into his vest pocket, extracted an enormous bulging gold pocket watch in a case, opened it, glanced at it slowly and lethargically, and put it back in his pocket. raskolnikov himself lay on his back in silence and stubbornly, though without thinking, studied the gentleman who had just entered. his face, now turned away from that particular flower on the wallpaper, was extremely pale and expressed uncommon suffering, as if he had just undergone a painful operation or had suddenly been released from some torture. the gentleman gradually began arousing his attention more and more, then his bewilderment, then uncertainty, and even some fear. when zosimov, having pointed to him, had said, “there’s raskolnikov,” he’d suddenly and quickly raised himself, as if jumping up, and sat on the edge of his bed; in an almost challenging voice, but also faltering and faint, he said: “yes. i’m raskolnikov. what do you want?” the guest looked at him intently and announced imposingly: “petr petrovich luzhin. i trust that my name is not completely unfamiliar to you.” but raskolnikov, expecting something completely different, regarded him vacantly and pensively and made no reply, as if he were definitely hearing petr petrovich’s name for the first time. “what? can it possibly be that you still haven’t received any news?” asked petr petrovich, somewhat taken aback. in reply, raskolnikov slowly sank onto his pillow, placed his hands behind his head, and began staring at the ceiling. anguish was perceptible on luzhin’s face. zosimov and razumikhin began scrutinizing him with even greater attention, and he finally became visibly embarrassed. “i assumed and reckoned,” he muttered, “that the letter sent more than ten days ago, almost two weeks ago, would’ve . . .” “listen, why are you still standing next to the doorway?” razumikhin asked, suddenly interrupting him. “if you have something to say, then take a seat; you and nastasya are crowding each other there. nastasyushka, move aside, let him pass! go on, there’s a chair, over here! squeeze in.” he moved the chair away from the table, left a little space between it and his knees, and waited in tense anticipation as the guest “squeezed” through this opening. the moment was chosen in such a way that it was impossible to refuse, and the guest, hurrying and stumbling, slid through this narrow space. after reaching the chair, he sat down and regarded razumikhin suspiciously. “don’t be embarrassed,” razumikhin rattled on. “rodya’s been ill for the last five days and was delirious for three of them. just now he’s returned to his senses and has even eaten with gusto. this is his doctor, who’s just examined him. i’m rodya’s friend, also a former student, and now i’m looking after him. don’t pay any attention to us and don’t be shy. go on and say what you have to say.” “thank you. but might i be disturbing the patient by my presence and my conversation?” petr petrovich asked, turning to zosimov. “n-no,” mumbled zosimov, yawning again, “you may even distract him.” “he’s been back with us for a while, since this morning!” continued razumikhin, whose familiarity had the air of such genuine simplicity that petr petrovich thought for a bit and began to take heart—in part, perhaps because this ragged and impudent fellow had introduced himself as a student. “your mama . . .” began luzhin. “hmm!” razumikhin said loudly. luzhin looked at him inquisitively. “never mind, just so; go on . . .” luzhin shrugged his shoulders. “your mama began writing a letter to you before i left. after my arrival here, i intentionally waited a few days and didn’t come to see you in order to be completely certain that you’d have been apprised of the whole matter; but now, to my surprise . . .” “i know, i know!” raskolnikov said suddenly, with an expression of the most impatient annoyance. “so it’s you? the suitor? well, i do know! and that’s enough!” petr petrovich was downright offended, but remained silent. he made a concerted effort to understand what all this meant. the silence continued for a minute. meanwhile, raskolnikov, who had turned toward him slightly after his response, suddenly took to staring directly at him again with some special curiosity, as if he hadn’t had the chance to examine him fully before, or as if something new about his appearance had struck him. he even raised himself up intentionally from his pillow to do this. as a matter of fact, something in petr petrovich’s general appearance did strike him as peculiar, that is, something that seemed to support the term “suitor,” conveyed upon him so unceremoniously just now. in the first place,"
dostoevsky,"it was evident, and even too noticeable, that petr petrovich had made hasty efforts to use his few days in the capital to get himself all decked out and fancied up in anticipation of meeting his fiancée, which fact, however, was extremely harmless and acceptable. even his own awareness, perhaps a bit too self-satisfied, his own awareness of this pleasant change for the better could be forgiven on such an occasion, for petr petrovich was close to being a bridegroom. all of his apparel had just come from a tailor, and it was all very fine, except perhaps that it was all too new and revealed his purpose too evidently. even his foppish, trendy round hat bore witness to it: petr petrovich treated his hat too respectfully and held it in his hands too cautiously. even his splendid pair of lilac-colored french gloves bore witness to the same thing, if only because he wasn’t wearing them, merely holding them in his hand for show. bright and youthful colors predominated in his apparel. he was wearing a fine summer jacket of a light brown hue, bright, lightweight trousers, the same kind of vest, brand-new refined linen, and a light cotton necktie with pink stripes, and best of all, this apparel was even becoming to petr petrovich. his face, extremely fresh and even ruddy, seemed younger than his forty-five years, even without his new clothes. dark muttonchop whiskers shaded his cheeks pleasantly and thickened handsomely next to his closely shaved, shining chin. even his hair, with only a slight trace of gray, had been combed and curled by a barber, but this fact didn’t make him look comical or foolish, as usually happens with curled hair, because it inevitably conveys to the face the look of a german about to get married. if there was anything really unpleasant and repulsive in his rather handsome and respectable appearance, it was caused by other factors. after unceremoniously examining mr. luzhin, raskolnikov smiled maliciously, once again lowered himself onto his pillow, and began staring at the ceiling as he had done before. but mr. luzhin gathered his strength and, it seems, resolved for the time being not to notice any of this strange behavior. “i very deeply regret that i find you in this situation,” he began again, ending the silence with some effort. “had i known you were ill, i’d have come by sooner. but, business, you understand! in addition, i have extremely important work pertaining to legal matters in the senate. i won’t even mention those concerns, which you can guess. and i await your family, that is, your mama and sister, at any moment . . .” raskolnikov stirred and was about to say something. his face expressed a certain agitation. petr petrovich paused and waited, but since nothing followed, he continued: “. . . at any moment. i’ve found them a place to stay for the time being . . .” “where?” raskolnikov inquired faintly. “very close to here. at bakaleev’s house.” “that’s on voznesensky prospect,” razumikhin interrupted. “there are two floors rented out as hotel rooms by the merchant yushin. i’ve been there.” “yes, hotel rooms . . .” “it’s a terribly filthy place: dirt, stench, full of suspicious types. things have happened there; the devil knows who actually lives there! i myself was present at some disgraceful affair. however, it is cheap.” “of course, i was unable to gather sufficient information about it, since i just arrived,” petr petrovich objected delicately. “however, i chose two very, very clean little rooms, and since it’s for such a short stay. . . . i’ve also found a real apartment, that is, our future apartment,” he said, turning to raskolnikov, “and renovations are being made to it now. meanwhile, i myself have squeezed into some rooms, not far from here, at madame lippevekhsel’s, in the apartment of my young friend andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov. he’s the one who told me about bakaleev’s house . . .” “lebezyatnikov?” raskolnikov said slowly, as if recalling something. “yes, andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov, an office worker in the ministry. do you happen to know him?” “yes . . . no . . .” raskolnikov replied. “forgive me, it seemed you did from your question. i was his guardian at one time . . . he’s a very nice young man . . . and terribly well informed. . . . i love to meet young people. you find out what’s new from them.” petr petrovich examined all those present with a hopeful look. “in what respect?” asked razumikhin. “in the most serious, so to speak, the most essential way,” petr petrovich explained, seeming to enjoy the question. “you see, i haven’t been to petersburg in the last ten years. all these new things, reforms, ideas—all of this has managed to reach us in the provinces, but to see it more clearly and to understand it all, one must be in petersburg. well, sir, my idea is that you notice more and learn more when observing our younger generation. i confess that i rejoiced . . .” “in what, precisely?” “your question is a broad one. i might be mistaken, but it seems that i find they have a clearer view, a more critical view, so to speak; they’re more effective . . .” “that’s true,” muttered zosimov. “not true, they’re not more effective.” razumikhin seized upon his words. “it’s hard to be effective; it doesn’t just descend from the heavens. for almost two hundred years, we’ve been weaned away from any action. . . . we may have plenty of ideas,” he said, turning to petr petrovich, “and a desire for the good, though it’s childlike. one can even find integrity, in spite of all the swindlers who’ve turned up among us, but there’s still no efficacy! effective people are nowhere to be seen.” “i don’t agree with you,” petr petrovich objected with visible pleasure. “of course, there are enthusiasms, inaccuracies, but one must be indulgent: enthusiasms bear"
dostoevsky,"witness to their fervor for action and to incorrect external circumstances in which the matter is placed. if little has been achieved, it’s because there’s been so little time. i’m not even referring to the means. in my personal view, if you like, one can even say that something has been achieved: new, useful ideas have been widely circulated, several new, useful works have been disseminated in place of the previous fantastic and romantic ones. literature has acquired a more mature outlook, and many harmful prejudices have been rooted out and ridiculed. . . . in a word, we’ve cut ourselves off once and for all from the past, and in my opinion, that’s already an achievement, sir . . .” “he’s memorized that speech! he’s showing off,” raskolnikov muttered suddenly. “what, sir?” asked petr petrovich, who hadn’t caught what was said, but he received no reply. “that’s all fair,” zosimov hastened to insert. “isn’t it true, sir?” continued petr petrovich, glancing pleasantly at zosimov. “you’ll agree yourself,” he continued, turning to razumikhin, but now with an element of triumph and superiority, and almost adding the phrase “young man” as he spoke, “that there’s been notable advancement, or, as they say now, progress, at least in the name of science and economic truth . . .” “how banal!” “no, it is not banal, sir! if, for example, up to now i was told to ‘love my neighbor,’ and did so, what came of that?” continued petr petrovich, perhaps with excessive haste. “what came of it was that i tore my cloak in two, gave half to my neighbor, and we both wound up half naked, just like in the russian proverb ‘if you chase two hares, you’ll catch neither.’ science tells us to love ourselves first of all because everything on earth is based on personal interest. if you love yourself alone, then you’ll conduct your affairs appropriately, and your cloak will remain in one piece. economic truth adds that the more private businesses we have in society and, so to speak, the more cloaks remain intact, then the firmer its foundations and the more will be accomplished for the common good. consequently, in acquiring solely and exclusively for myself, i’m also acquiring for all, and making sure that my neighbor receives somewhat more than a torn cloak and not because of private, solitary generosity, but as the result of general advancement. the idea is simple, but unfortunately, too long in the coming, hidden by a penchant for enthusiasm and fantasy; it seems that a little cleverness is necessary to surmise that . . .” “excuse me, i’m not too clever, either,” razumikhin cut in abruptly. “therefore, let’s stop here. i began with a purpose, but all of this chatter for self-amusement, all these incessant, endless commonplaces, over and over again, have become so loathsome to me over the last three years, that, so help me god, i blush when other people utter them in my presence, let alone when i myself say them. you naturally hastened to show off your knowledge. that’s very understandable, and i don’t condemn you. i’d only like to know now who you are, because don’t you see, so many opportunists have latched onto these commonplaces of late and have distorted everything they touch to such an extent, out of their own interest, that they have defiled the entire cause. well, sir, that’s enough!” “my dear sir,” luzhin began, wincing with a sense of his own extraordinary worth, “are you implying, so unceremoniously, that i, too . . .” “oh, for pity’s sake. . . . would i do that? well, sir, that’s enough!” snapped razumikhin, then turned abruptly to zosimov to resume their previous conversation. petr petrovich proved to be clever enough to accept this explanation immediately. however, he decided to leave in a few minutes. “i trust that now our newly formed acquaintance,” he said, turning to raskolnikov, “after your recovery and in view of the circumstances you know well, will become even stronger. . . . i especially wish you good health . . .” raskolnikov didn’t even turn his head. petr petrovich was about to stand up and take his leave. “the murderer was definitely someone who pawned something!” zosimov declared firmly. “absolutely!” razumikhin agreed. “porfiry won’t reveal what he’s thinking, but he’s questioning those people who pawned items.” “are they all being interrogated?” raskolnikov asked loudly. “yes, what of it?” “nothing.” “how is he finding them?” “kokh named a few. other names were written on the wrappings of the items, and other people came forward on their own, when they heard about it . . .” “well, the murderer must be a cunning and experienced rogue! what impudence! what resolve!” “that’s precisely what he’s missing!” razumikhin interrupted. “that’s what’s leading you all astray. i maintain that he was inept and inexperienced, and this was probably his first endeavor! if you assume he was a calculating and cunning rogue, then the whole thing turns out improbably. assume an inexperienced fellow, and it turns out that it was chance alone that saved him from disaster, and what can’t chance do? he might not even have foreseen the obstacles he’d encounter! how did this affair proceed? he took items worth ten or twenty rubles, stuffed them into his pocket, searched around in the old woman’s trunk, among her clothes—but later, in her dresser, in a box in the top drawer, they find fifteen hundred rubles in cash, plus some notes! he didn’t know how to rob; he only knew how to murder! it was his first endeavor, i tell you, his first. he lost his head! it wasn’t calculation, but chance that saved him.” “you seem to be talking about the recent murder of the old woman, the civil servant’s widow,” petr petrovich intervened, addressing zosimov, and wishing to insert a few more clever words before he left, even though he was already standing with his hat and gloves in hand. clearly, he"
dostoevsky,"was concerned about making an impression and his vanity had overcome his good sense. “yes. you’ve heard about it?” “of course, it occurred close by . . .” “do you know the details?” “i can’t say that i do; but what interests me about it is another circumstance, the whole problem, so to speak. i’m not talking about the fact that in the last five years the number of crimes among the lower class has increased. i’m not talking about the constant, universal robberies and arsons. for me the strangest thing of all is that the number of crimes among the upper class is also increasing, in parallel, so to speak. in one town, we learn that a former student has robbed the mail along the main road. elsewhere, some people of respectable social standing are engaged in forging banknotes; in moscow, they apprehended an entire gang counterfeiting tickets for the last public lottery—among the leading participants was one lecturer in world history. the secretary in one of our embassies was murdered for some enigmatic financial dealings. . . . now, if this old woman pawnbroker was killed by one of her clients, it must have been someone of higher social standing, since peasants don’t pawn gold items—how, then, do we explain this depravity of the civilized part of our society?” “there have been many economic changes,” zosimov observed. “how can that be explained?” razumikhin latched onto the question. “it can easily be explained by their too deep-rooted lack of effectiveness.” “what do you mean, sir?” “how did that lecturer in moscow reply to your question of why he was counterfeiting lottery tickets? ‘everyone gets rich in his own way, so i also wanted to do so quickly.’ i don’t recall his exact words, but the idea was that he’d become wealthy for free, as quickly as possible, without having to work for it! they’re used to having everything done for them, living off the charity of others, being spoon-fed. but when the great hour struck, they showed what they’re made of . . .” “but what about morality? and, so to speak, the rules of . . . ?” “why are you making such a fuss?” raskolnikov broke in unexpectedly. “it worked out according to your theory!” “how’s that?” “if you follow the theory that you were advocating just now to its conclusion, it turns out that one can slaughter people . . .” “good lord!” cried luzhin. “no, that’s not true!” echoed zosimov. raskolnikov lay there pale, his upper lip quivering, breathing heavily. “there are limits to everything,” luzhin continued haughtily. “the economic idea is still not an invitation to murder, and if one can merely assume . . .” “is it true that you,” raskolnikov suddenly interrupted again, his voice trembling with rage and the pleasure of giving offense, “is it true that you told your fiancée . . . at the very moment she accepted your proposal, that you were extremely pleased that . . . she was poor . . . because it was more advantageous to take a wife out of poverty so that you could dominate her afterward . . . and reproach her for the favors you’d bestowed on her?” “my dear sir,” luzhin cried maliciously and irritably, flushed and flustered, “my dear sir . . . you’ve distorted my idea! excuse me, but i must say that the rumors that have reached you, or, better to say, those conveyed to you, haven’t the least trace of solid foundation, and i . . . i suspect who . . . in a word . . . launched this arrow . . . in a word, your mama. . . . even before this, she seemed, in spite of all her excellent qualities, to have a somewhat ecstatic and romantic cast to her views. . . . but i was still a thousand miles away from supposing that she could represent this matter in a form so distorted by her fantasy. . . . and finally . . . finally . . .” “do you know what?” cried raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and staring at him with a piercing, flashing glance. “do you know what?” “what, sir?” luzhin paused and waited with an offended and challenging look. several seconds passed in silence. “if you dare once again . . . utter even one word . . . about my mother . . . i will throw you down the stairs head over heels!” “what’s the matter with you?” cried razumikhin. “so that’s how it is!” luzhin said, turning pale and biting his lip. “listen to me, sir,” he began in measured tones, using all his strength to restrain himself, but gasping for breath nonetheless. “from the very start i surmised your hostility, but remained here on purpose to learn even more. i could forgive a sick man and a relative a great deal, but now . . . you . . . never, sir . . .” “i’m not ill!” cried raskolnikov. “all the more reason, sir . . .” “go to hell!” but luzhin was already leaving without having finished his speech, squeezing between the table and the chair again. this time, razumikhin stood up to let him pass. without looking at anyone, and without even nodding to zosimov, who had already indicated to him that he should leave the sick man in peace, luzhin left, cautiously raising his hat to his shoulder as he bent slightly when he passed through the door. even the curve of his back seemed to express how, on this occasion, he was carrying a terrible insult away with him. “how can you, how can you act like this?” asked the perplexed razumikhin, shaking his head. “leave me alone, all of you, leave me alone!” raskolnikov cried in a frenzy. “will you leave me alone once and for all, you tormentors? i’m not afraid of you! i’m . . . not afraid of anyone now!"
dostoevsky,"go away! i want to be alone, alone, alone, alone!” “let’s go,” said zosimov, nodding to razumikhin. “but can we leave him like this?” “let’s go,” repeated zosimov insistently, and then he walked out. razumikhin thought for a moment and ran to catch up with him. “it could be worse if we didn’t listen to him,” said zosimov, already on the stairs. “he shouldn’t become aggravated . . .” “what’s wrong with him?” “if only he could be given some sort of beneficial push, that would do it! he was fine just a little while ago. . . . you know, he has something on his mind. something immovable, oppressive. . . . i’m absolutely afraid of that!” “then there’s that fellow, perhaps, this petr petrovich! according to their conversation, it’s clear that he’s marrying his sister and that rodya received a letter about this before his illness . . .” “yes. the devil brought him here just now. perhaps he’s ruined the whole business. did you notice that he was indifferent to everything, made no response to anything except for one point when he lost his self-control: the murder . . .” “yes, yes!” razumikhin agreed. “i did notice it! he’s interested in it and he gets frightened. that’s what scared him that day at the police office when he fainted.” “you’ll tell me more about it this evening, and i’ll tell you something later. he interests me greatly! i’ll come back in half an hour to see how he is. . . . but there won’t be any pneumonia . . .” “thank you! meanwhile i’ll wait at pashenka’s and will check on him through nastasya . . .” raskolnikov, left alone, regarded nastasya, who was slow taking her leave, with impatience and anguish. “would you like some tea now?” she asked. “later! i want to sleep! leave me alone . . .” he turned feverishly to face the wall. nastasya left. oceanofpdf.com vi b ut as soon as she left, raskolnikov stood up, fastened the hook on the door, untied the bundle of clothes razumikhin had delivered earlier, which he’d tied up again, and began to get dressed. it was strange: he suddenly seemed completely calm; there was none of his half-crazed delirium as before, none of the overwhelming fear he’d experienced previously. for the first time, he felt a sudden, strange serenity. his movements were precise and assured, his certain intentions clear. “today, definitely today!” he muttered to himself. yet he understood that he was still weak, but the strongest spiritual tension that had resulted in this serenity, in unwavering resolution, was also affording him strength and self-assurance; he hoped, however, that he wouldn’t keel over on the street. after having changed completely into his new clothes, he looked at the money left on the table, thought for a bit, and then put it into his pocket. he had twenty-five rubles in cash. he also picked up all the five-kopeck coins, the change from the ten rubles spent on clothes by razumikhin. then he quietly unlocked the door, walked out of the room, descended the staircase, and peeked into the open door of the kitchen: nastasya was standing with her back to him, stooping to fan the fire in the landlady’s samovar. she didn’t hear a thing. and who’d suppose that he’d go out? a minute later, he was already on the street. it was about eight o’clock, and the sun was sinking in the sky. although it was as stuffy as before, he greedily inhaled the stinking, dusty air contaminated by the city. his head started to spin slightly. some sort of wild energy suddenly shone in his inflamed eyes and in his gaunt, pale yellow face. he didn’t know and didn’t even think about what direction he was taking. he knew only one thing: “that he had to put an end to all this today, once and for all, immediately; that otherwise he wouldn’t go home because he didn’t want to live this way .” but how to end it? in what way? he didn’t have the slightest idea, and he didn’t want to think about it. he drove those thoughts away: thinking tormented him. he merely felt and knew that everything had to change, one way or another, “no matter how,” he repeated with desperate, resolute self-assurance and decisiveness. by force of habit he headed for the haymarket, the usual path of his previous walks. before he reached it, on the road, in front of a small shop, there stood a young, black-haired organ grinder playing a very sentimental song. he was accompanying a young girl, about fifteen, standing in front of him on the sidewalk, decked out as a fine lady, wearing a crinoline, a mantilla, gloves, and a straw hat with a fiery red feather; all of her clothes were old and worn out. she was singing a romance in a coarse, rough, but rather strong, pleasant voice, in expectation of receiving a two-kopeck piece from the shopkeeper. raskolnikov stood alongside two or three bystanders, listened for a while, pulled out a five-kopeck piece, and put it into the girl’s hand. she suddenly ended her song on the most sentimental high note, as if she had cut it off, and shouted abruptly to the organ grinder: “that’ll do!” they both moved on to the next shop. “do you like street singers?” raskolnikov said, turning suddenly to a gentleman, no longer young, who was standing next to him near the organ grinder and had the look of a flâneur. the latter regarded him with curiosity and great astonishment. “i do,” raskolnikov continued, with a look that seemed to show that he was not talking about street singers at all. “i like it when they sing with an organ grinder on a cold, dark, damp autumn evening, absolutely on a damp evening, when all the passersby have pale green, sickly faces; or, even better, when wet snow is falling straight down, without any"
dostoevsky,"wind, you know, and gaslights are shining through it . . .” “i don’t know, sir. . . . excuse me,” muttered the gentleman, frightened by both raskolnikov’s question and his strange look, and crossed to the other side of the street. raskolnikov continued straight ahead and came to that corner on the haymarket where the trader and his wife had been buying and selling, and where they’d stood chatting that time with lizaveta; but they weren’t there now. after recognizing the spot, he stopped, looked around, and turned to a young lad in a red shirt, who was standing there yawning near the entrance to a flour shop. “there’s a man who engages in trade here on this corner, with a woman, his wife, right?” “all kinds of people trade here,” replied the lad, taking raskolnikov’s measure condescendingly. “what’s his name?” “just as he was christened.” “you must be from zaraysk, right? what province?” the lad looked at raskolnikov again. “we don’t have any provinces where i come from, your excellency, but districts. it was my brother who came here, while i stayed at home, so i don’t know, sir. . . . be kind and forgive me, your excellency.” “is that an eating place upstairs?” “it’s a tavern, and it has billiard tables. you can even find preencesses there. . . . fine folks!” raskolnikov walked across the square. there, on the corner, stood a large crowd of people, all peasants. he made his way into the crowd, glancing at their faces. for some reason he felt like chatting with everyone. but the peasants didn’t pay him any attention and were clustered in small groups, making a racket. he stood there awhile, thought for a bit, turned to the right, and proceeded along the sidewalk, in the direction of voznesensky prospect. after crossing the square, he found himself in a lane. he frequently used to pass along this short street, which made a bend and then led from the square to sadovaya street. lately, when he’d been feeling queasy, he’d even felt like returning to all these places, “to make himself even queasier.” now, as he turned into the street, he wasn’t thinking about anything. there was a large building filled with taverns and other eating places; women constantly came running out, dressed as if they were “going to visit their neighbors”—bareheaded, wearing only dresses, but no coats. in two or three spots they crowded in groups on the sidewalk, primarily near the entrances to the lower floor, where, a few steps down, one could descend into various extremely entertaining institutions. * in one of them, at that moment, there was a loud noise and a commotion that filled the whole street; a guitar was being strummed, songs were being sung, and it was all very cheerful. a large group of women had collected near the door; some were sitting on the steps, others were gathered on the sidewalk, and still others were standing and chatting. nearby on the street, a drunken soldier with a cigarette was making his way, cursing loudly; he seemed to want to go in somewhere but had forgotten where. one ruffian was cursing another, and a very drunken fellow was sprawled out in the street. raskolnikov stopped near a large group of women. bareheaded and all wearing cotton dresses and goatskin shoes, they were chatting in hoarse voices. some of them were over forty years old, but others were only about seventeen; almost all had black eyes. for some reason the singing and all that noise and commotion downstairs attracted him. . . . from there he could hear, amid the laughter and squeals, underneath the thin falsetto of the lively refrain and the accompaniment of a guitar, someone dancing for all he was worth, tapping out the rhythm with his heels. he listened intently, gloomily, and broodingly, leaning forward at the entrance, glancing curiously from the sidewalk into the room. oh, you fine policeman, you, don’t you beat me up for nothing! the singer’s thin voice warbled. raskolnikov desperately wanted to hear the words that were being sung, as if that were the most important thing. “should i go in?” he wondered. “they’re laughing! all drunk. maybe i should get drunk, too?” “are you going in, kind sir?” asked one of the women in a rather resonant voice that was not yet hoarse. she was young and not unattractive—one of the group of women. “my, you’re a pretty one!” he replied, standing up straight and glancing at her. she smiled: clearly, she really appreciated his compliment. “you’re not so bad-looking yourself,” she said. “he’s so skinny!” another woman muttered in a low voice. “did you just get out of the hospital, or what?” “you’re all trying to look like generals’ daughters, yet you have snub noses!” interrupted a peasant who had just approached; he was tipsy, wearing a heavy coat left open, with a sly grin on his mug. “hey, what merrymaking!” “go on in, if you’re here!” “i will! what sweethearts!” and he tumbled down the stairs. raskolnikov moved on. “listen, sir,” one girl cried after him. “what?” she became embarrassed. “i’d always be glad to share some time with you, kind sir, but now my conscience is bothering me. give me, my fine gentleman, six kopecks for a drink!” raskolnikov took out whatever coins he had: three five-kopeck pieces. “ah, what a generous gentleman!” “what’s your name?” “ask for duklida.” “no, no. what’s all that?” one of the women remarked, shaking her head at duklida. “i just don’t know how she can ask like that! i’d certainly die from shame . . .” raskolnikov looked with curiosity at the woman who was speaking. her face was pockmarked; she was about thirty years old, covered with bruises, and had a swollen upper lip. she spoke and criticized calmly and seriously. “where was it,” raskolnikov wondered as he moved farther along, “where was it that i read that a person sentenced to"
dostoevsky,"death, during his last hour, says or thinks that if he were made to live somewhere high up, on a cliff, on such a narrow platform that he only had room for his two feet, and he was surrounded by an abyss, an ocean, eternal darkness, eternal solitude, and eternal storms—and that if he could remain there standing on his small bit of space for his entire life, a thousand years, for eternity—it would be better to live like that than to die at once! “only to live, to live, to live! to live, no matter how—only to live! how true! how true, oh lord! man’s a scoundrel! and the person who calls him a scoundrel for that is also a scoundrel,” he added a moment later. he emerged onto another street: “bah! the crystal palace! razumikhin was talking about the crystal palace just a little while ago. but what was it i wanted to do? yes, read. . . . zosimov said that he read in the papers about . . .” “do you have any newspapers?” he asked upon entering an extremely spacious and even orderly tavern that consisted of several rooms, though they were rather deserted. two or three customers were drinking tea, and in one distant room a group of four was sitting, sipping champagne. it seemed to raskolnikov that zametov was among them, but it was difficult to tell from afar. “so what!” he thought. “would you like some vodka, sir?” asked the waiter. “i’d like some tea. and bring me the newspapers, older ones, for the last five days, and i’ll give you some money for a drink.” “yes, sir. here’s today’s paper, sir. and would you like some vodka, sir?” the older papers and tea were brought. raskolnikov sat down and began searching through them: “izler—izler—aztecs—aztecs—izler—bartola—massimo—aztecs—izler. . . . damn it all! ah, here’s the news: a woman fell down the stairs—a tradesman burned up as a result of drink—a fire in the sands—a fire on the petersburg side—another fire on the petersburg side—izler—izler—izler—izler—massimo. . . . ah, here it is . . .” he finally found what he was looking for and began reading; the lines jumped before his eyes; however, he read the entire “news item” and greedily searched through following issues for the latest additions. his hands were trembling from feverish impatience as he turned the pages. all of a sudden someone sat down at his table, opposite him. he glanced up—it was zametov, the very same, looking the same, with rings and chains, his curled and pomaded black hair parted in the same way, wearing a fashionable vest, a somewhat worn jacket, and dirty linen. he was cheerful; at least he was smiling cheerfully and good-naturedly. his dark face was a little flushed from the champagne. “so! you’re here?” he began in a puzzled voice, with a tone as if they’d known each other forever. “razumikhin told me only yesterday that you were still delirious. how strange! i came by to see you, you know . . .” raskolnikov knew that he had come by. he pushed the newspapers away and turned to face zametov. there was a smile on his lips, and some sort of new, irritated impatience shone through his smile. “i know you came by,” he replied. “i did hear that, sir. you were searching for my sock. . . . you know, razumikhin’s very fond of you; he says that you and he went to see laviza ivanovna, the one you were trying to help that time, winking at lieutenant porokh, but he didn’t get it, you remember? how could he not—the matter was perfectly clear, wasn’t it?” “what a rowdy fellow he is!” “porokh?” “no, your friend razumikhin . . .” “you live pretty well, mr. zametov; you get free access to the best places! who’s been just filling you full of champagne?” “we were just . . . having a drink. . . . don’t exaggerate!” “your reward! you make the best use of everything!” raskolnikov started laughing. “never mind, my good fellow, never mind!” he added, slapping zametov on the shoulder. “i’m not being mean, but ‘it’s out of love, playing,’ just like that workman said when he was punching mitka, in the case of the old woman.” “how do you know?” “perhaps i know more than you do.” “you’re such a strange fellow. . . . you must still be very ill. you shouldn’t have gone out . . .” “so, i seem strange to you?” “yes. so, you’re reading newspapers?” “yes, newspapers.” “there’s a lot about all the fires . . .” “no, i’m not reading about fires.” at this point he looked at zametov mysteriously; a sarcastic smile curled on his lips again. “no, i’m not reading about fires,” he continued, winking at zametov. “confess, my dear young man, that you’d really like to know what i’ve been reading about.” “i don’t care at all; i merely asked. can’t i ask? why do you keep . . .” “listen. you’re an educated man, a literary man, right?” “i finished the sixth class at the gymnasium,” replied zametov with a certain dignity. “sixth class! ah, quite the star pupil! with a part in your hair, rings on your fingers—you’re a wealthy man! phew, what a fine young lad you are!” at this moment raskolnikov burst into nervous laughter, right in his face. zametov flinched, and although he did not exactly take offense, he was extremely surprised. “phew, you’re such a strange fellow!” repeated zametov very seriously. “it seems to me that you must still be delirious.” “delirious? you’re all wrong, my dear! so, in your opinion, i seem strange? well, am i arousing your curiosity, huh? am i?” “you are.” “well, you mean what i’ve been reading about, what i’ve been searching for? just see how many issues i had them bring me! suspicious, isn’t it?” “well, tell me.” “are you all ears?” “what do you mean?” “i’ll explain that"
dostoevsky,"to you later; but now, my dear fellow, i declare . . . no, even better, ‘i confess. . . .’ no, that’s not right either: ‘i’m making a statement, and you take it down,’ ” that’s what! so i’m making a statement that i’ve been reading, that i’ve taken an interest in . . . that i was looking for, that i was searching . . .” raskolnikov screwed up his eyes and waited. “what i found out—and that’s exactly why i came here—about the murder of the old woman, the civil servant’s widow,” he said at last, almost in a whisper, drawing his face extremely close to zametov’s face. zametov stared directly at him without stirring, not moving his face away from raskolnikov’s. later it seemed to zametov that the strangest thing about that moment was that their silence lasted a full minute, and for that minute they stared directly at each other. “well, what difference does it make what you’ve been reading,” he cried out suddenly, in perplexity and impatience. “what do i care? what about it?” “it’s about that very same old woman,” raskolnikov continued in the same whisper, without flinching after zametov’s exclamation, “the one you were talking about at the office, you recall, when i fainted. well, now do you understand?” “what’s all this? what do you mean, ‘understand’?” asked zametov, almost alarmed. raskolnikov’s motionless and serious face was transformed in one moment, and he suddenly burst into the same nervous laughter as before, as if he were absolutely unable to restrain himself. and at that moment, he recalled with an extraordinarily clear sensation another recent moment when he had stood behind the door, axe in hand, with the bolt bouncing up and down; they were standing outside the apartment arguing, trying to force the door open, and he had suddenly felt like shouting at them, arguing with them, sticking his tongue out at them, taunting them, mocking them, and laughing, laughing, laughing! “you’re either out of your mind, or . . .” zametov remarked, then paused, as if suddenly struck by a thought that passed through his mind like a bolt of lightning. “or? what’s that ‘or’? well, what? say it!” “nothing!” zametov replied irately. “it’s all nonsense!” they both fell silent. after an abrupt, fitful burst of laughter, raskolnikov suddenly became thoughtful and glum. he placed his elbows on the table and rested his head on his hands. he seemed to have forgotten all about zametov. the silence lasted rather a long time. “why don’t you drink your tea? it’ll be cold,” zametov said. “huh? what? tea? all right . . .” raskolnikov took a swallow from the glass and put a small piece of bread into his mouth. looking at zametov, he suddenly seemed to recall everything and pulled himself together. at that moment, his face assumed its original sarcastic expression. he continued drinking his tea. “these days a large number of swindlers have turned up,” said zametov. “just recently i read in the moscow news that a gang of counterfeiters had been apprehended. there was a whole society of them. they were forging banknotes.” “oh, that was a long time ago! i read that a month ago,” raskolnikov replied serenely. “so, you think they were really swindlers?” he added with a laugh. “what else could they be?” “what else? they were children, greenhorns, not swindlers! fifty people gathered together for that purpose! is that possible? three would have been too many, and even then, it would work only if they trusted each other more than they trusted themselves! if only one of them got drunk and let the cat out of the bag, the whole scheme would collapse! greenhorns! they hire unreliable people to change banknotes in offices: can you trust perfect strangers with a job like that? well, let’s suppose those greenhorns succeeded; let’s suppose each one got away with a million rubles; well, then what? for the rest of their lives? each one would depend on all the others for the rest of their lives! they’d be better off hanging themselves! and they didn’t even know how to exchange the counterfeit notes: one of them walked into the bank office, exchanged five thousand rubles, and his hands were shaking. he counted out four thousand, but took the fifth without even counting, on faith, so he could stash it in his pocket and get away as soon as possible. well, he aroused suspicion and the whole scheme came crashing down as a result of one fool! is that the way to do it?” “his hands were shaking?” interrupted zametov. “no, that’s possible, sir. no, i’m absolutely sure it’s possible. what if you couldn’t bear the strain?” “of what?” “and you, could you bear it? no, i couldn’t! confront such terrible danger for a reward of one hundred rubles! to go—where? into a bank office with counterfeit notes, where they know all the tricks of the trade—no, i’d get frazzled. wouldn’t you, too?” once again raskolnikov felt the urge to “stick out his tongue.” at times a shiver ran up and down his spine. “i wouldn’t have done it like that,” he began in a roundabout way. “here’s how i would have changed the counterfeit banknotes: i’d have counted the first thousand very carefully, four times over, examining each note, and then moved on to the next thousand; i’d have begun counting that one, reached the middle of the pile, and then pulled out some fifty-ruble note, held it up to the light, turned it over, and held that side up to the light, too—checking to see if it was counterfeit. ‘i’m afraid,’ i would say. ‘several days ago, a relative of mine lost twenty-five rubles.’ and i would have told him the whole story. and when i started counting the third thousand—‘no, wait, i think i miscounted the seventh hundred in the second thousand.’ i’d be overcome by doubt; then i’d put down the third thousand, return to the"
dostoevsky,"second, and so on for all five. as soon as i’d finished, i’d pull one banknote out of the fifth thousand and one out of the second, hold them up to the light again, and i would say, looking very doubtful, ‘please exchange these,’ and thus i would drive the clerk to utter exasperation, so that he’d be looking for a way to get rid of me! i’d finish all my business, start to leave, open the door—but no, excuse me, i’d go back again, ask about something else, and listen to his explanation—that’s how i’d do it!” “phew! what terrible things you say!” zametov said with a laugh. “but that’s all just talk; in fact, if you were actually doing the deed, you’d probably falter. i tell you, in my opinion, not only you and i, but even an experienced, desperate man couldn’t depend on himself. why go so far? here’s an example: an old woman was murdered in our neighborhood. it seems it was done by a real blockhead, taking all sorts of risks in broad daylight, saved only by a miracle—and still his hands were shaking: he didn’t know how to rob her, couldn’t take it; it’s clear from the case that . . .” raskolnikov seemed to take offense. “clear? well, then, go find him now!” he cried, urging zametov on maliciously. “what of it? he’ll be caught.” “by whom? by you? will you catch him? you’ll wear yourself out! here’s what you consider most important: is the man spending the money or not? he had no money before, and then he suddenly starts spending. it must be him! a child could fool you with that argument, if only he wanted to!” “the thing is, that’s exactly what they all do,” replied zametov. “they murder shrewdly, risk their lives, then go straight to a tavern and get drunk. they’re caught when they start spending. they’re not all as clever as you are. of course, you wouldn’t go right to a tavern, would you?” raskolnikov frowned and stared directly at him. “it seems you’ve developed a taste for my approach and want to know how i’d behave in this case?” raskolnikov asked with displeasure. “i would,” zametov replied firmly and seriously; he began speaking and staring a bit too intensely. “very much?” “very much.” “all right. this is how i’d have behaved,” began raskolnikov, once again suddenly drawing his face close to zametov’s, staring intently at him again, and whispering once more, so that this time zametov even shuddered. “here’s what i’d have done: i’d have taken the money and the items and, as soon as i’d left, immediately, without stopping anywhere, i’d have gone off somewhere to a remote spot where there were only fences, no one around—some garden or something like that. i’d have been to the yard beforehand and have looked for a large rock, weighing some forty or fifty pounds, somewhere over in a corner, near a fence, that had perhaps been there since the house had been built; i’d have lifted up this rock—there’d have to be a space under it—and i’d have placed all the items and the money into that space. i’d have replaced the rock and put it back the same way as it was before, pressed it down with my foot, and then gone away. i wouldn’t have touched it for a year, or two, or three—well, just try to find that murderer! he was here, but he’s vanished!” “you’re mad,” zametov muttered, also in a whisper; then, for some reason, he moved away from raskolnikov. raskolnikov’s eyes were shining; he’d grown terribly pale; his upper lip was trembling and shaking. he leaned toward zametov, as close as he could get, and began moving his lips, uttering nothing at all; he stayed like that for half a minute; he knew what he was doing, but was unable to stop himself. a terrible word, like the bolt on the old woman’s door, trembled on his lips: any moment the bolt would give way, any moment he would let the word out, any moment he would utter it! “what if it was me who murdered the old woman and lizaveta?” he said suddenly and—came to his senses. zametov looked at him in fright and turned pale as a ghost. his face was distorted by a smile. “is that possible?” he asked, barely audibly. raskolnikov looked at him spitefully. “admit that you believed me. eh? didn’t you?” “not at all! now i believe it even less!” zametov said hastily. “you’re caught at last! the star pupil’s been caught. if you ‘believe it less,’ that means you must have believed it before.” “not in the least!” cried zametov, obviously flustered. “was that why you frightened me, just to lead me to this?” “so you don’t believe me? then what were you talking about after i left the office, then? and why did lieutenant porokh interrogate me after i fainted? hey, you,” he shouted to the waiter, standing and picking up his cap. “how much do i owe you?” “thirty kopecks in all, sir,” he replied, running over. “here’s an extra twenty kopecks to buy yourself a drink. see how much money i have!” he stretched his trembling hand toward zametov; it was full of banknotes—ten-ruble notes and fives, twenty-five rubles in all. “where did i get them? where did i get my new clothes? you know that i didn’t have a kopeck before. you’ve probably questioned my landlady already. . . . well, enough. assez causé ! † good-bye. . . . all the best!” he left, trembling from some wild hysterical feeling mixed together with unbearable pleasure—he was feeling gloomy, however, and horribly tired. his face was distorted, as if after some sort of seizure. his exhaustion was quickly increasing. his strength was aroused and now came on suddenly with the first stimulus, with the first irritating sensation, and that waned just as quickly as the sensation faded away. meanwhile zametov,"
dostoevsky,"left alone, sat in deep thought in the same spot for some time. raskolnikov had unexpectedly overturned all his thoughts on a certain point and forced him to reach a definitive conclusion: “ilya petrovich is a blockhead!” he decided once and for all. just as soon as raskolnikov had opened the door to the street, suddenly, there on the stairs, he met razumikhin, who was coming into the tavern. neither saw the other, even a step away, and they almost bumped heads. for some time they measured each other with their glances. razumikhin was greatly astonished, but all of a sudden, rage, genuine rage flashed menacingly in his eyes. “so this is where you are!” he cried at the top of his lungs. “you ran away from your bed! i even looked for you under your sofa! we even went up to the attic looking for you! i almost gave nastasya a beating because of you. . . . and where were you? rodka! what does this mean? tell me the whole truth! confess! you hear?” “it means that i was bored to death with all of you and want to be alone,” raskolnikov replied calmly. “alone? when you still can’t walk, when your mug’s still pale as a ghost, and you’re gasping for breath! you fool! what were you doing in the crystal palace? confess at once!” “let me go!” said raskolnikov, attempting to move past. this drove razumikhin into a rage; he grabbed him firmly by the shoulder. “let you go? you dare say, ‘let me go!’ do you know what i’m going to do with you now? i’ll grab hold of you, tie you up in a bundle, carry you home under my arm, and lock you up.” “listen, razumikhin,” raskolnikov began softly, apparently in complete calm. “don’t you see that i don’t want your kindness? what’s this desire of yours to do good deeds for those who . . . who spit on them? for those who ultimately find your kindness really difficult to bear? why did you come looking for me when i first fell ill? perhaps i would’ve been glad to die? well, haven’t i shown you clearly today that you’re tormenting me, and that . . . i’m fed up with you! why this desire to torment other people? i can assure you that all this seriously interferes with my recovery, because it constantly irritates me. zosimov left the other day so he wouldn’t annoy me! would you, too, leave me alone, for heaven’s sake? besides, what right do you have to restrain me by force? don’t you see that now i’m speaking entirely in my right mind? how, how, tell me at last, how can i finally convince you not to keep pestering me and stop you from trying to be nice to me? say i’m ungrateful, say i’m vile, but leave me alone, all of you, for heaven’s sake, leave me alone! let me be! let me be!” he began serenely, taking pleasure beforehand in the venom he was about to spew, but he finished in a frenzy, gasping for breath as he had previously with luzhin. razumikhin stood there, thought for a while, and removed his hand. “go to hell!” he said softly, almost thoughtfully. “wait!” he roared suddenly when raskolnikov was about to stir from where he stood. “listen to me. i declare that all of you, to the last one, are blabberers and braggarts! as soon as you come up against some pathetic bit of suffering, you fuss over it like a hen with her egg! even then you steal from other writers. there’s not a trace of independent life in you! you’re made from waxy spermaceti whale oil, and you have watery whey in your veins instead of blood! i don’t trust any of you! the first thing you do in any circumstance is try not to resemble a human being! wait!” he cried with redoubled fury, having noticed that raskolnikov was about to take his leave again. “hear me out to the end! you know that people are coming to my housewarming today; perhaps they’ve gathered already. i left my uncle there to receive the guests—and stopped in here just now. so, if you were not such a fool, not such a vulgar fool, an absolute fool, a translation from the original . . . you see, rodya, i admit, you’re clever, but you’re still a fool! well, if you were not such a fool, you’d be better off coming by my place today to spend the evening there than wearing out your new boots for nothing here. since you’re out, why not? i’d borrow a nice, soft armchair for you; my landlord has one. . . . you’d have some tea, some company. . . . or else, you could lie down on the couch—you’d still be among us. . . . and zosimov will be there. perhaps you’ll change your mind and come?” “no.” “you’re lying!” cried razumikhin impatiently. “how do you know? you can’t answer for yourself! you don’t understand a thing. . . . i’ve quarreled with others a thousand times like this, broken it off, and then gone running back to them again. . . . you feel ashamed—so you go back to the person! remember, it’s pochinkov’s house, the third floor . . .” “it seems you’ll let anyone beat you up, mr. razumikhin, just for the enjoyment of being nice to him.” “who? me? i’d twist his nose if he so much as dreamt of it! pochinkov’s house, number , the apartment of the civil servant babushkin . . .” “i won’t come, razumikhin!” raskolnikov said, turning and walking away. “i bet you will!” razumikhin shouted after him. “or else you . . . or else i won’t have anything to do with you! hey, wait a moment! is zametov in there?” “yes.” “did you see him?” “i did.” “and talk to him?” “i did.” “about what? well, the"
dostoevsky,"hell with you, then don’t tell me. pochinkov’s house, number , babushkin’s apartment, remember!” raskolnikov went as far as sadovaya and then turned the corner. razumikhin watched thoughtfully as he went. at last, he gestured contemptuously, entered the building, but stopped in the middle of the stairs. “damn it all!” he continued, almost aloud. “he talks sense, but it’s as if. . . . what a fool i am! don’t madmen make sense? it seems that zosimov was afraid of something exactly like this.” he tapped his forehead. “well, what if . . . how can i let him go away alone now? he might drown himself. . . . hey, i’ve slipped up! i can’t!” he ran back, chasing after raskolnikov, but he was already gone. he spat in disgust and hastened back to the crystal palace to interrogate zametov as quickly as possible. raskolnikov went directly to the voznesensky bridge, stood in the middle near the railing, rested his elbows on it, and gazed off along the bank. after parting from razumikhin, he felt so weak that he’d scarcely managed to get there. he felt like sitting or lying down somewhere in the street. leaning out over the water, he absentmindedly regarded the last pink glow of sunset, the row of houses, which grew darker in the deepening twilight, one distant little window, somewhere up in an attic along the left bank, shining with a flame from the last ray of sunlight that struck it for a moment, and the darkening water of the canal; he seemed to be staring at the water with particular attention. in the end, some shapes like red circles began spinning before his eyes, the houses began moving, passersby, the embankments, carriages—everything began turning and dancing around. suddenly he shuddered, perhaps saved from another fainting spell by one riotous, hideous sight. he suddenly felt that somebody was standing near him, at his right side, next to him; he glanced up and saw a tall woman wearing a kerchief, with a yellow, elongated, emaciated face and sunken reddish eyes. she stared directly at him, but obviously didn’t see anything and couldn’t perceive anything. suddenly she rested her right hand on the railing, lifted her right leg and thrust it over, then her left leg, and threw herself into the canal. the dirty water parted and swallowed its victim instantly, but in a minute the drowning woman surfaced and was carried along gently , her skirt puffed up above the water like a pillow. “she’s drowning herself! drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people came running, and both embankments were covered with spectators. a crowd gathered on the bridge around raskolnikov, surrounding him and pressing in on him from behind. “good lord, that’s our afrosinyushka!” a tearful woman’s voice called out from nearby. “good heavens, save her! kind sirs, pull her out!” “a boat! a boat!” people cried out from the crowd. but a boat was unnecessary: a policeman ran down the steps to the edge of the canal, threw off his overcoat and boots, and plunged into the water. it didn’t take much effort: the drowning woman was carried by the current to within a few feet of the edge. he grabbed her clothing with his right hand, and with his left, he took hold of a pole that his comrade had extended toward him. the drowning woman was immediately fished out of the water. she was placed on the granite blocks of the stairs. she came to quickly, raised herself, sat up, and began sneezing and sniffling, senselessly wiping her hands on her wet dress. she didn’t say a word. “she drank herself silly, kind sirs, absolutely silly,” howled that same woman’s voice, now standing right next to afrosinyushka. “a few days ago she tried to hang herself, but they cut her down. just now i went into a shop and left a young girl to watch over her—and here’s what happened! she’s a trader, dear sirs, one of us; we live nearby, the second house from the corner, right over here . . .” the crowd parted while the policemen were still fussing over the young woman; someone shouted something about the police station. . . . raskolnikov regarded everything with a strange sensation of indifference and unconcern. he felt disgusted. “no, it’s vile . . . water . . . it’s no good,” he muttered to himself. “nothing will come of it,” he added, “there’s no reason to wait. what’s that about the police station? why isn’t zametov there? it’s open till ten o’clock.” he turned his back to the railing and looked around. “well, all right! why not?” he said decisively; he moved away from the bridge and headed in the direction of the police station. his heart was empty and hollow. he didn’t want to think. even his glum mood had passed; there was no trace of the former energy he’d felt when he’d left home “to end it all.” complete apathy had taken its place. “well then, it’s a way out!” he thought, walking slowly and limply along the canal embankment. “still, i’ll end it because i want to. . . . but is it a way out? it makes no difference! there’ll be just a square yard of space—ha! but what an ending! is it really the end? will i tell them or not? oh . . . hell! i’m very tired: it would be good to lie down or sit down somewhere soon! the most embarrassing thing is that i did it very stupidly. to hell with all that! phew, such stupid thoughts occur to me . . .” to get to the police station, he had to go straight and then turn left at the second street: it was just a few steps away. but when he reached the first street, he stopped, thought for a bit, turned into the lane, and walked around, through two streets—perhaps without any goal, just to extend the moment and"
dostoevsky,"gain some time. he walked along, looking down at the ground. suddenly it was as though someone whispered something in his ear. he raised his head and noticed that he was standing next to that same house, near the gates. he hadn’t been back here since that same evening and hadn’t even passed by. an irresistible, inexplicable desire drew him. he entered, crossed under the gateway, then went into the first entrance on the right, and began climbing the familiar staircase up to the fourth floor. it was very dark on the narrow, steep stairs. he paused on each landing and looked around with curiosity. on the first-floor landing, the window frame had been removed from one window. “it wasn’t like that then,” he thought. next he came to the apartment on the second floor where nikolashka and mitka had been working: “it’s locked; the door’s been freshly painted; that means it’s for rent.” here’s the third floor . . . and the fourth . . . “here!” he was struck with bewilderment. the door to the apartment was wide open, there were people inside, and voices could be heard: he hadn’t expected that at all. after hesitating a little, he climbed the last stairs and entered the apartment. it was being redecorated; there were workers inside; that seemed to astound him. for some reason, he’d imagined that he would find the place just as he’d left it then, perhaps even with the bodies in the same place on the floor. but now there were bare walls and no furniture; it seemed so strange! he crossed to the window and sat down on the window seat. there were only two workmen, both young lads, one older, and the other much younger. they were hanging new paper on the walls, white with lilac flowers, instead of the previous yellow, worn-out, faded wallpaper. for some reason, raskolnikov didn’t like that at all; he regarded the new paper with hostility, as if regretting that anything had changed. the workmen, apparently, had lingered and now were hastily rolling up the wallpaper, planning to leave for home. raskolnikov’s appearance attracted almost no attention. they were chatting about something or other. raskolnikov folded his arms and began listening. “so she comes to me, that one does, in the morning,” says the elder to the younger, “at the crack of dawn, all dressed up. ‘what’s this about?’ i say. ‘why are you prancin’ and struttin’ in front of me?’ i say. ‘’cause,’ she says, ‘from now on, tit vasilich, i want you to be my lord and master.’ that’s what she says! and she’s all dressed up: just like in a journal, a real journal.” “what’s a journal, uncle?” asked the younger lad. obviously he was “uncle’s” pupil. “a journal, my friend, is full o’ pictures, colored ones, and they come to the local tailor’s every saturday, in the mail, from abroad, and they show how to dress, both for men and the same for women. there’s drawin’s, i mean. men are wearin’ short winter coats, but as for women, my friend, such tarts, if you gave me everythin’ you have, it still wouldn’t be enough.” “the things you find in this petersburg of ours!” the younger lad said enthusiastically. “everythin’ you could possibly wish for!” “everythin’, my young friend, absolutely everythin’,” the older man affirmed instructively. raskolnikov stood up and went into the other room, where previously the trunk, the bed, and the chest of drawers had been: the room seemed terribly small with no furniture. the wallpaper here was still the same. in the corner he could see clearly outlined the place where the icon case had stood. he looked around and returned to his little window. the elder workman was keeping an eye on him. “what do you want, sir?” he asked suddenly, turning to him. instead of a reply, raskolnikov stood up and went to the passageway, took hold of the bell chain, and yanked it. it was the same bell, the same metallic sound! he yanked it a second time and a third; he listened and remembered. the previous, horribly tormenting, hideous feeling returned to him all the more distinctly and vividly; he shuddered with every sound, yet it seemed more and more enjoyable to him. “what do you want? who are you?” cried one workman, coming out to meet him. raskolnikov entered through the door again. “i want to rent this apartment,” he said. “i’m looking around.” “people don’t rent apartments at night; besides, you must come to see it with the caretaker.” “they washed the floor; will they paint it?” raskolnikov continued. “there’s no blood?” “what blood?” “the old woman and her sister were murdered here. there was a large pool.” “what sort of a person are you?” cried the workman apprehensively. “me?” “yes.” “you want to know? let’s go to the police station. i’ll tell you there.” the workmen looked at him in confusion. “it’s time for us to go, sir. we’ve stayed too long. let’s go, alyoshka. we have to lock up,” the elder workman said. “well, let’s go!” replied raskolnikov apathetically and walked out ahead, descending the stairs slowly. “hey, caretaker!” he cried, as he went through the gate. several people stood at the entrance to the house, looking at passersby on the street: two caretakers, a peasant woman, a tradesman in a robe, and someone else. raskolnikov walked right up to them. “what do you want?” one of the caretakers asked. “have you been to the police station?” “i was just there. why do you want to know?” “is anyone still there?” “yes.” “is the assistant there?” “he was for a while. what’s it to you?” raskolnikov made no reply and stood next to him, deep in thought. “he came to see the apartment,” said the elder workman, drawing near. “which one?” “where we’re working. ‘why,’ he says, ‘did you wash away the blood? here,’ he says, ‘there was a murder, and i want to rent"
dostoevsky,"the apartment.’ he starts ringing the doorbell, almost tore it off. ‘let’s go,’ he says, ‘to the police station, and i’ll tell you everything.’ he latched onto us.” the caretaker looked at raskolnikov in confusion and scowled. “and just who the hell are you?” he cried more threateningly. “i am rodion romanych raskolnikov, a former student. i live at shil’s house, in the lane nearby, not far from here, apartment number . ask the caretaker . . . he knows me,” raskolnikov uttered all this lazily and distractedly, without turning around, staring intently at the darkened street. “why’d you come to this apartment?” “to see it.” “what’s there to see?” “should we take him to the police station?” the tradesman ventured and then fell silent. raskolnikov glanced at him over his shoulder, regarded him attentively, and said just as quietly and lazily: “let’s go!” “and take him!” cried the tradesman, feeling encouraged. “why was he going on about that ? does he have something on his mind, huh?” “drunk or not, god knows,” muttered the workman. “what do you want?” cried the caretaker again, beginning to grow really angry. “why are you bothering us?” “are you afraid to go to the police?” raskolnikov asked with a smirk. “why should i be afraid? why are you pestering us?” “what a rascal!” cried the peasant woman. “why even talk to him?” cried the other caretaker, an enormous peasant dressed in a heavy tunic and carrying keys on his belt. “clear out! you’re a rascal, all right. . . . clear out!” grabbing raskolnikov by the shoulder, he shoved him out into the street. he almost went head over heels, but didn’t fall; he managed to right himself, looked at all the spectators in silence, and then walked away. “a strange bird,” said the workman. “folks is all strange these days,” said the peasant woman. “still, we should’ve taken him to the police,” added the tradesman. “there’s no reason to get mixed up in it,” concluded the large caretaker. “he’s a rascal, he is! he’s up to something, that’s clear, but if we get mixed up in it, it won’t be easy to get out. . . . we know that!” “should i go or not?” raskolnikov wondered, pausing in the middle of the street at the crossing and looking around, as if expecting the final word to come from someone. but there was no reply from anywhere; everything was silent and dead, like the cobblestones he walked on, dead to him, to him alone. . . . suddenly, far off, about two hundred steps away, at the end of the street, in the thickening darkness, he made out a crowd, voices, shouting. . . . some sort of carriage stood amidst the throng. . . . a light was shining in the middle of the street. “what’s that?” raskolnikov wondered; he turned to the right and headed toward the crowd. he seemed to be grasping at anything and smiled coldly when he realized that fact, because he had definitely decided to go to the police station and knew for sure that everything would soon end. * a euphemism for brothels. † “enough talk; that will do!” (french). oceanofpdf.com vii a gentleman’s fashionable carriage stood in the middle of the street, harnessed to a pair of lively gray horses. there were no passengers, and the coachman himself, after climbing down from the box, stood next to them, holding the horses by their bridle. a large crowd had gathered, and some policemen were standing in front of them. one was holding a lit lantern, with which, by leaning over, he was casting light on something lying on the pavement near the carriage wheels. everyone was talking, shouting, and exclaiming; the coachman seemed confused and kept repeating, from time to time: “what a shame! lord, what a terrible shame!” raskolnikov got as close as he could and finally saw the object of all this commotion and curiosity. on the ground lay a man who had just been run over by the horses. he was apparently unconscious, very badly dressed, but in what had once been “respectable” clothes; he was covered in blood. blood was flowing from his face and head; his face was all beaten, battered, and mangled. it was clear that he’d been badly trampled and was in very grave condition. “good lord!” wailed the coachman. “how could i have avoided it? if i’d been racing or hadn’t called out to him—but i wasn’t going fast, only at a moderate pace. everyone saw: i’m just repeating what everyone else says. a drunk can’t even walk a straight line—that’s well known! i saw him; he was crossing the street, reeling from side to side, and almost falling over. . . . i shouted to him once, then a second time, a third, and i reined in my horses; but he stumbled right into them and fell under their hooves! either he did it on purpose, or else he was very drunk. . . . the horses are young, easily startled; they shied and he screamed—then it got worse . . . that’s how it was.” “that’s what happened!” cried a witness’s voice from the crowd. “he did shout, that’s true, he shouted to him three times,” echoed another. “exactly three times, everyone heard!” cried a third. the coachman, however, was neither very disconsolate nor frightened. it was clear that the carriage belonged to some wealthy and influential person, who was somewhere awaiting its arrival; the policemen, of course, took great pains to expedite the matter. they would have to transport the injured man first to the police station and then to the hospital. no one knew his name. meanwhile, raskolnikov had crowded in closer and had bent over the victim. suddenly the lantern brightly lit the unfortunate man’s face: he recognized him. “i know him, i do!” he shouted, pushing to the front of the crowd. “he’s a civil servant, a retired titular counselor, marmeladov!"
dostoevsky,"he lives near here, in kozel’s house. . . . get a doctor immediately! i’ll pay! here!” he pulled some money out of his pocket and kept showing it to a policeman. raskolnikov was in a state of extreme agitation. the policemen were pleased to learn the unfortunate man’s identity. raskolnikov identified himself, provided his address, and, with all his might, as if it concerned his own father, tried to persuade them to carry the unconscious marmeladov home as quickly as possible. “it’s right here, only three houses away,” he pleaded, “kozel’s house, a german, a wealthy man. . . . he was just on his way home, probably drunk. i know him. . . . he’s a drunkard. . . . he has a family, a wife, children, and one daughter. there’s no need to take him to the hospital when there’s probably a doctor in his building! i’ll pay for it, i will! he’ll be cared for by his own people; they’ll help right away, or else he’ll die before he gets to the hospital . . .” he’d even managed to slip something into the policeman’s hand. the matter, moreover, was clear and legal; in any case, help was closer. helpers were found to lift and carry the injured man. kozel’s house was only about thirty steps away. raskolnikov walked behind, carefully supporting marmeladov’s head and showing them the way. “this way, over here! we have to climb the stairs with his head first; turn around . . . that’s the way! i’ll pay, i’ll be grateful,” he muttered. katerina ivanovna, as always when she had a free moment, had just begun pacing up and down in their small room, from the window to the stove and back again, her arms tightly folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. lately, she’d begun chatting more often and at greater length with her elder little girl, the ten-year-old polyenka, who, even though she didn’t understand all that much, knew very well that her mother needed her, and therefore followed her with her large clever eyes, pretending with all her might that she understood everything. this time polyenka was undressing her younger brother, who had been sick all day; she was getting him ready for bed. while his shirt was being changed, because it was going to be washed that night, the little boy sat up on a chair silently, straight and motionless, with a serious look on his face. his little feet were stretched out in front of him, squeezed tightly, heels together and toes turned outward. he was listening to what his mother was saying to his sister, his lips pouting, his eyes bulging, sitting still, just the way all clever little boys should sit when they are being undressed and prepared for bed. his other sister, who was even younger and wearing only rags, stood next to the screen, waiting her turn. the door to the landing was open, so that some of the waves of tobacco smoke coming from the other rooms could disperse; it was making the poor consumptive woman cough long and hard. katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during the last week; the red blotches on her cheeks burned even brighter than before. “you won’t believe, you can’t imagine, polyenka,” she said, pacing the room, “how cheerfully and splendidly we lived at home with your papa, how that drunkard destroyed me, and how he’ll destroy all of you, too! your papa was a state councillor and almost became a governor; there was only one step left, so everyone came to him and said, ‘we already think of you, ivan mikhailych, as our governor.’ when i . . . cough, when i . . . cough, cough, cough . . . oh, damn it!” she cried, spitting up phlegm and grabbing her chest. “when i . . . ah, when at the last ball . . . at the home of the marshal of the nobility * . . . princess bezzemelnaya saw me, polya, the one who later gave me her blessing when i married your papa, she asked at once, ‘isn’t that the sweet girl who did the shawl dance at her graduation?’—that tear should be mended; take a needle right now and sew it up as i taught you, or else tomorrow . . . cough ! tomorrow . . . cough, cough, cough . . . it will tear even more,” she cried in a violent outburst. “at that time prince shchegolsky, a gentleman of the bedchamber, had just arrived from petersburg . . . he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to propose marriage the very next day; but i thanked him in the most flattering terms and said that my heart had belonged to another man for a long time. that other man was your father, polya; papa was terribly angry. . . . is the water ready? well, give me the shirt; where are the stockings? lida,” she said, addressing her younger daughter, “you’ll go to sleep tonight without your shirt; somehow . . . and put your stockings next to it. . . . they have to be washed together. . . . why hasn’t that good-for-nothing come home, that drunkard? he’s worn that shirt of his too long, like some old rag, and torn it all to pieces. . . . i want to wash it at the same time, so as not to suffer for two nights in a row! lord! cough, cough, cough, cough! again! what’s that?” she cried, glancing at the crowd in the entry and at the people carrying something, pushing into her room. “what’s this? what are they carrying? good lord!” “where do we put him?” asked the policeman, looking around after they’d lugged the bloody and unconscious marmeladov into the room. “on the sofa! put him right on the sofa, with his head over here,” raskolnikov said. “he was run over on the street!"
dostoevsky,"drunk!” cried someone from the entryway. katerina ivanovna stood there, pale, breathing with difficulty. the children were frightened. little lidochka cried out, rushed to polyenka, hugged her, and started trembling all over. after seeing marmeladov laid out, raskolnikov rushed over to katerina ivanovna: “for heaven’s sake, calm down, don’t be afraid!” he said very quickly. “he was crossing the street and a carriage ran him over; don’t be upset; he’ll come to. i had him brought here. . . . i’ve been here before, do you remember? he’ll come to. i’ll pay!” “he got what he wanted!” katerina ivanovna cried in desperation and threw herself on her husband. raskolnikov quickly noticed that this was not the sort of woman who would faint immediately. in a flash, a pillow turned up under the unfortunate man’s head, something no one else had thought of. kate­rina ivanovna began to undress him, examine him, fuss over him; she didn’t become flustered; she forgot all about herself, bit her trembling lips, and suppressed the cries ready to escape her chest. meanwhile raskolnikov persuaded someone to fetch a doctor. it turned out that a doctor lived two houses away. “i’ve sent for a doctor,” he said to katerina ivanovna. “don’t be distressed, i’ll pay. do you have any water? and give me a napkin, a towel, something, quickly; it’s still not clear where he’s been hurt. . . . he’s wounded, but he’s not been killed, rest assured. . . . we’ll see what the doctor says!” katerina ivanovna rushed to the window; there, on a broken chair in the corner, stood a large clay washbasin with water, readied for washing the children’s and her husband’s clothes that night. katerina ivanovna herself, with her own hands, performed this nighttime chore at least twice a week, and sometimes more frequently, because things had reached the point that they had almost no clean clothes to change into. each member of the family had only one item, and katerina ivanovna could not stand any dirt and thought it better to torment herself at night and work beyond her strength when everyone else was asleep so that the wet clothes would have time to dry on a line before morning; she preferred to provide clean clothes for everyone, rather than to see dirt in her house. she was about to grab the washbasin and hand it over to raskolnikov, as he had requested, but she almost stumbled with the heavy load. he’d already managed to find a towel, soak it in water, and had begun wiping the blood from marmeladov’s face. katerina ivanovna stood there, inhaling painfully, holding her arms across her chest. she herself needed assistance. raskolnikov began to think that perhaps he had done the wrong thing, having persuaded them to bring the wounded man here. the policeman also stood there, confused. “polya!” shouted katerina ivanovna. “go fetch sonya, quickly. if she’s not home, all the same, say that her father’s been run over by horses and that as soon as she gets home . . . she should come at once. hurry, polya! here, wrap yourself with this shawl!” “run fas’ as you can!” shouted the little boy from the chair. after saying this, he sank once more into his previous silent posture on the chair, his eyes bulging, his heels together, toes turned outward. meanwhile, the room became so full that there was no space left at all. the policemen had gone, except for one who stayed a little longer and tried to push the spectators who had come in from the stairs back out again. almost all the lodgers at mrs. lippevekhsel’s apartment had spilled out of the inner rooms; at first they crowded only in the doorway, but later they came bursting into the room itself. katerina ivanovna flew into a rage. “at least let someone die in peace!” she screamed at the entire crowd. “what sort of spectacle have you come to watch? and smoking cigarettes! cough, cough, cough! even wearing your hats! there’s someone with a hat. . . . out! have some respect for a dying man!” coughs choked her, but her threat seemed to work. apparently, they were even somewhat afraid of katerina ivanovna; the lodgers, one after another, crowded back to the doorway with that same strange inner feeling of satisfaction that is always present, even in one’s nearest and dearest, when sudden misfortune strikes someone close; it spares no one at all, without exception, no matter how sincere our feelings of pity and sympathy. behind the door, however, one could hear voices murmuring about the hospital and saying that people shouldn’t be bothered here for nothing. “it’s not right to die!” cried katerina ivanovna. she was about to yank the door open so she could let loose a storm of abuse at them, but in the doorway she bumped into mrs. lippevekhsel herself, who had just heard about the accident and come running in to restore order. she was an extremely quarrelsome and disorderly german woman. “ach, mein gott!” she cried, throwing up her hands. “your drunken husband a horse trumpled. to hospital take him! i’m here landlady!” “amaliya lyudvigovna! i beg you to think about what you’re saying,” katerina ivanovna began haughtily (she always employed a haughty tone of voice when she spoke with the landlady, so that she would “remember her place,” and even now she could not deny herself that pleasure). “amaliya lyudvigovna . . .” “i told you once for all that you not dare say to me amal lyudvigovna; i’m amal-ivan!” “you’re not amal-ivan, but amaliya lyudvigovna, and since i don’t belong to the group of your vile flatterers, like mr. lebezya­tnikov, who’s now laughing behind the door”—the sound of laughter was coming from behind the door, as well as shouts of “they’re squabbling!”—“then i will always call you amaliya lyudvigovna, though i really can’t understand why you don’t like that name. you can see for yourself what’s happened to semyon zakharovich; he’s"
dostoevsky,"dying. i beg you to lock the door and not to admit anyone in here. let him die peacefully! otherwise, i can assure you, your action will be made known to the governor-general himself. the prince knew me when i was young and unmarried, and he remembers semyon zakharovich very well, to whom he showed his favor many times. you know that semyon zakharovich had many friends and protectors, whom he abandoned out of his own noble pride, sensing his own unfortunate weakness, but now”—she indicated raskolnikov—“a generous young man is assisting us. he has the means and connections; semyon zakharovich knew him as a child. you can be sure, amaliya lyudvigovna . . .” all of this was uttered very quickly; the more she said, the faster it went, but a fit of coughing interrupted katerina ivanovna’s eloquence. at that moment, the dying man came to and moaned: she rushed over to him. he opened his eyes and, still not recognizing or understanding where he was, began scrutinizing raskolnikov, who was standing over him. he was breathing heavily, deeply, and infrequently; blood had oozed from the corners of his mouth; drops of sweat stood on his forehead. not recognizing raskolnikov, he began looking around. katerina ivanovna regarded him with a grim but stern look; tears flowed from her eyes. “my god! his chest’s completely crushed! blood, so much blood!” she said in desperation. “we have to take all his outer clothes off! turn over a little, semyon zakharovich, if you can,” she cried to him. marmeladov recognized her. “a priest!” he uttered in a hoarse voice. katerina ivanovna went to the window, leaned her head against the frame, and cried desperately: “damn it all!” “a priest!” the dying man said again, after a moment’s silence. “they’ve sent for one!” katerina ivanovna shouted to him; he heard her cry and fell silent. he searched for her with a sad, timid look in his eyes; she turned back to him and stood at his head. he calmed down a bit, but not for long. soon his eyes came to rest on little lidochka (his favorite). she was trembling in the corner as if she were having a seizure, staring at him with her intense, astonished, childlike gaze. “ah . . . ah…” he said, indicating her with unease. he wanted to say something. “what else?” cried katerina ivanovna. “she’s barefoot! barefoot!” he muttered, with his half-witted glance fixed on the little girl’s bare feet. “be quiet!” katerina ivanovna shouted at him irritably. “you yourself know why she’s barefoot!” “thank god, the doctor!” cried raskolnikov, overjoyed. the doctor entered, a proper old man, a german, looking around with uncertainty. he approached the patient, took his pulse, carefully felt his head, and, with katerina ivanovna’s help, unbuttoned his blood-soaked shirt and uncovered his chest. marmeladov’s entire chest was mangled, crushed, and mutilated. several ribs on the right side were broken. on the left side, above his heart, there was a large, ominous, yellowish-black mark, a cruel blow from the horse’s hoof. the doctor frowned. the policeman told him that the unfortunate man had been caught in the wheel and dragged along the road for some thirty paces. “it’s astonishing that he’s come to,” the doctor whispered softly to raskolnikov. “what do you think?” raskolnikov asked. “he’ll die soon.” “is there really no hope?” “not in the least! he’s at his last breath. . . . his head is very badly injured. . . . hmm. perhaps we could let some blood . . . but . . . it’ll be useless. he’ll certainly die within five or ten minutes.” “then let some blood.” “perhaps. . . . but i warn you, it’ll be absolutely useless.” just at this time, some other steps were heard; the crowd in the entrance divided, and a priest, an old man with gray hair, appeared on the threshold, carrying the sacraments. a policeman from outside followed him in. the doctor immediately yielded his place and exchanged a meaningful glance with him. raskolnikov asked the doctor to wait a little longer. he shrugged his shoulders and remained in the room. everyone backed away. the confession didn’t last very long. the dying man hardly understood anything; he could only utter disjointed and inarticulate sounds. katerina ivanovna took lidochka, lifted the little boy from his chair, and, moving to the corner of the room near the stove, went down on her knees and placed the children on their knees in front of her. the young girl merely trembled; as for the boy, on his bare little knees, he raised his little hand slowly, crossed himself, bowed down and touched his forehead to the floor, which, apparently, afforded him particular pleasure. katerina ivanovna bit her lips and held back her tears; she also prayed, at times adjusting the child’s small shirt, and managing to cover the little girl’s bare shoulders with a scarf that she took from the wardrobe without having to get up from her knees or interrupt her prayers. meanwhile the doors of the inner rooms were beginning to be opened again by curious onlookers. more and more spectators, lodgers from the entire staircase, were crowding into the entrance; however, they dared not cross the threshold or enter the room. the entire scene was lit by only one candle stub. at that moment from the entrance, polyenka, who had gone to fetch her sister, pushed hastily through the crowd. she entered, still gasping for breath from racing home, took off her shawl, searched with her eyes for her mother, went up to her and said, “she’s coming! i found her on the street!” her mother made her kneel down and placed her nearby. from the crowd, silently and timidly, a young woman forced her way in; her sudden appearance in this room was strange, amid the poverty, ragged clothes, death, and desperation. she was also wearing tattered clothes; her apparel was shoddy, but she was decked out in the manner"
dostoevsky,"of the streets, with the taste and style characteristic of her own particular sphere, with an obvious and shameful purpose. sonya paused at the threshold, but didn’t cross it and looked like a lost soul. she seemed to be unaware of everything, having forgotten about her fourth-hand colorful silk dress, so inappropriate here, with its long, comical train, its enormous crinoline blocking the whole door, her light-colored shoes, her little parasol, unnecessary at night, but which she carried with her, and her ridiculous round straw hat with its bright fiery-colored feather. from under this hat, which she was wearing with a boyish tilt to one side, there peeked a thin, pale, frightened little face with a gaping mouth and eyes fixed with a look of horror. sonya was about eighteen years old and not very tall; she was thin, but rather pretty, with fair hair and remarkable blue eyes. she stared intently at the bed and at the priest; she was also panting from running so fast. at last the whispering, some words spoken by someone in the crowd, probably reached her ears. she lowered her eyes, stepped across the threshold, and entered the room, though still remaining near the doorway. the confession and communion ended. katerina ivanovna went up to her husband’s bed again. the priest stepped away and, as he did, turned to say a few words of parting and consolation to katerina ivanovna. “what will i do with them?” she interrupted him shrilly and angrily, pointing to the little ones. “god is merciful. rely on the almighty for assistance,” the priest began. “eh! merciful, but not to us!” “that’s a sin, madam, a sin,” the priest remarked, shaking his head. “isn’t this a sin?” cried katerina ivanovna, indicating the dying man. “perhaps those who were the involuntary cause of his death will agree to compensate you, at least for the loss of income . . .” “you don’t understand me,” katerina ivanovna cried indignantly, waving her arm. “why should there be any compensation? he was drunk and wound up under the horses’ hooves! what sort of income? there’s no income from him, only torment. that drunkard spent it all on drink. he robbed us and went off to the tavern with the money. he’s wasted their lives and mine in a tavern! thank god he’s dying! we’ll lose less!” “you should forgive in the hour of death, madam, or else it’s a sin; such feelings are a great sin!” katerina ivanovna was fussing over the dying man, offering him something to drink, wiping the sweat and blood from his head, adjusting his pillows and chatting with the priest, addressing him from time to time at odd moments. but now she suddenly turned on him almost in a rage. “hey, father! that’s all just words! forgive him? if he hadn’t been run over, he would’ve come home drunk tonight, his one shirt worn out and tattered, and gone right to sleep, dead to the world, while i splashed around in water until dawn, washing his and the children’s clothes, drying them out the window, and then, as soon as it was light, i’d have to sit down and mend them—that’s how i spend the night! why even talk about forgiveness? even so, i have forgiven him!” a terrible, deep cough disrupted her words. she spat into her handkerchief and thrust it at the priest to show him, clutching her chest in pain with her other hand. the handkerchief was covered in blood . . . the priest bowed his head and said nothing. marmeladov was in his last agony. he didn’t take his eyes off kate­rina ivanovna’s face as she leaned over him once more. he kept wanting to say something; he was trying to speak, moving his tongue with effort, uttering incoherent words, but katerina ivanovna understood that he wanted to ask her forgiveness, and immediately shouted at him imperiously: “quiet! that’s unnecessary! i know what you want to say!” the dying man fell silent, but at that moment his wandering glance fell on the door and he caught sight of sonya . . . up to this point he hadn’t noticed her: she stood in a corner in the shadows. “who’s that? who is that?” he suddenly asked in a hoarse, gasping voice, full of anxiety, looking in horror at the door where his daughter was standing as he made an effort to raise himself up. “lie down! lie down now!” katerina ivanovna started shouting. but with unnatural strength he managed to lean on his arm. he stared at sonya wildly and intently for some time, as if not recognizing her. he had never seen her dressed in such clothes before. all of a sudden he recognized her, humiliated, crushed, decked out, and embarrassed, humbly awaiting her turn to bid farewell to her dying father. his face expressed infinite suffering. “sonya! my daughter! forgive me!” he cried, wanting to extend his hand to her. but losing his support, he fell from the sofa and crashed facedown onto the floor. they rushed to pick him up, lay him down, but he was breathing his last. sonya cried out weakly, rushed to him, embraced him, and almost fainted in his embrace. he died in her arms. “he got what he wanted!” katerina ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s dead body. “now what do we do? how can i afford to bury him? and how, how will i feed them tomorrow?” raskolnikov went up to katerina ivanovna. “katerina ivanovna,” he began, “last week your late husband told me the story of his life and all the circumstances. . . . rest assured that he spoke about you with rapturous respect. since that evening, when i learned how devoted he was to you all, and especially how he respected and loved you, katerina ivanovna, in spite of his unfortunate weakness, since that evening he and i became friends. . . . allow me now . . . to help by repaying"
dostoevsky,"a debt to my late friend. here . . . twenty rubles, i think—and if this can serve as assistance, then . . . i . . . in a word, i’ll come by—i’ll definitely come . . . perhaps i’ll even come tomorrow. . . . good-bye!” he left the room quickly, hurriedly pushing through the crowd on the staircase; but there in the crowd he bumped into nikodim fomich, who had learned about the accident and wished to deal with it personally. they hadn’t seen each other since the scene at the police station, but nikodim fomich recognized him instantly. “oh, so it’s you?” he said. “he’s dead,” replied raskolnikov. “a doctor was here, a priest, too, and everything’s in order. don’t disturb this very unfortunate woman; even before this, she’d been suffering from consumption. encourage her somehow, if you can. . . . you’re a good man, i know that,” he added with a smile, looking him right in the eye. “but how is it you’re covered in blood?” asked nikodim fomich, noticing by the light of his lantern several fresh spots on raskolnikov’s vest. “yes, covered in blood . . . completely!” raskolnikov said with a particular look, and then smiled, nodded his head, and went down the stairs. he left quietly, without hurrying, unaware of his fever, full of an immense, new feeling of full, powerful life surging within him. this feeling could be compared to that of a man condemned to death who is suddenly and unexpectedly pardoned. † when he was halfway down the stairs, the priest, who was returning home, caught up with him. after they exchanged a quiet bow, raskolnikov silently let him pass. but when he reached the bottom, he suddenly heard hurried footsteps behind him. someone was trying to catch up with him. it was polyenka; she was running after him and calling to him, “wait! listen!” he turned to her. she came down to the last step and stopped right in front of him, one step higher. dim light shone in from the courtyard. raskolnikov could make out the girl’s thin but pretty little face; she smiled at him, regarding him cheerfully, in a childlike manner. she had come with a commission, one that, apparently, she liked very much. “listen! what’s your name? where do you live?” she asked hurriedly, her voice breaking as she gasped for breath. he placed his hands on her shoulders and looked at her with special happiness. he found it very pleasant to look at her—he didn’t know why. “who sent you?” “my sister sonya,” the little girl replied, smiling even more cheerfully. “i knew that it was your sister sonya who sent you.” “mama also sent me. when my sister sonya began speaking, mama also came up and said, ‘hurry up, polyenka.’ ” “do you love your sister sonya?” “i love her more than anyone!” polyenka replied with special insistence, and her smile suddenly became more serious. “and will you come to love me?” instead of an answer, he saw the girl’s face draw near his, her full lips innocently ready to kiss him. all of a sudden her arms, thin as matchsticks, embraced him very tightly, her head rested on his shoulder, and the little girl began crying softly, pressing her face more and more tightly against him. “i feel sorry for papa!” she said a minute later, raising her tearstained little face and wiping her tears with her hands. “such awful things have been happening lately,” she added unexpectedly, with a particularly mature look that children intentionally acquire when they suddenly want to talk like “grown-ups.” “did your papa love you?” “he loved lidochka best of all of us,” she continued very seriously and without a smile, now speaking just like a grown-up. “he loved her because she was little, and also because she was ill. he was always bringing her presents. he taught us to read and taught me grammar and religion,” she added with dignity. “mama didn’t say anything, but we knew that she liked that, and papa knew, and mama wants to teach me french because it’s already time for me to be educated.” “and do you know how to pray?” “oh, yes, of course we do! we have for a long time. since i’m already a big girl, i pray on my own, while kolya and lidochka pray aloud with mama; first they say a hail mary and then one more prayer: ‘o, god, forgive and bless our sister sonya.’ then another, ‘o, god, forgive and bless our other papa,’ because our older father died, and he’s our other papa, and we also pray for the first one.” “polechka, my name is rodion. pray for me sometime, too: ‘and thy servant, rodion.’ that’s all you need to say.” “i will pray for you for the rest of my life,” the little girl said passionately and suddenly began laughing again. she rushed to him and embraced him tightly once more. raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to stop by tomorrow without fail. as a result, the girl went away in complete ecstasy. it was after ten o’clock when he emerged onto the street. five minutes later, he stood on the bridge, at the very same spot where the woman had thrown herself into the water not long ago. “enough!” he pronounced decisively and triumphantly. “away with mirages, away with presumed fears, away with apparitions! life exists! didn’t i just now experience real life? my life didn’t end together with that old woman’s! may the kingdom of heaven be hers and—enough, old woman, it’s time to rest! now it’s the kingdom of reason and light, and . . . and free will and strength . . . now we’ll see! now we’ll match strengths!” he added haughtily, as if addressing some dark force and calling upon it. “and there i was agreeing to live on one square yard of space!” “. . . i’m feeling"
dostoevsky,"very weak now, but . . . my illness seems to have passed. i knew that it would when i left a little while ago. by the way, pochinkov’s house is only a few steps away. i should definitely go to razumikhin’s, even if it’s farther away. . . . let him win his bet! let him make fun of me—never mind, let him! strength, strength is what’s needed, because without it you can’t do anything. you have to gain strength by means of strength, that’s what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently. he left the bridge, scarcely able to move his legs. his pride and self-confidence grew minute by minute; by the next moment, he was no longer the same man he’d been just a minute ago. but what had occurred that was so special that it had transformed him so? he himself didn’t know; as if grasping for straws, it suddenly seemed to him that “he could live, there was still life ahead, and it hadn’t died along with that old woman.” perhaps he had hastened to reach that conclusion, but he didn’t think about that. “but i asked for ‘thy servant rodion’ to be remembered,” suddenly flashed through his mind. “well, that’s . . . just in case!” he added, and then began laughing at his own childish trick. he was in an excellent frame of mind. he found razumikhin easily, as everyone already knew the new lodger in pochinkov’s house. the doorman showed him the way immediately. halfway up the stairs he could already hear the noise and lively conversation of the large gathering. the door to the staircase was open wide, and he could hear shouts and arguments. razumikhin’s room was rather large, and there were about fifteen people gathered in it. raskolnikov paused in the entryway. there, behind a partition, two of the landlord’s servants were attending to two large samovars next to bottles, plates, and dishes with pies and snacks brought up from the landlord’s kitchen. raskolnikov asked for razumikhin. he came running in ecstasy. from the first glance, it was clear that he’d had more to drink than usual. although razumikhin could rarely drink enough to get drunk, this time something was amiss. “listen,” raskolnikov hastened to say. “i’ve come merely to say that you won the bet and that no one knows what can happen. i can’t come in. i’m too weak and will topple over any minute. so, greetings and farewell. come see me tomorrow . . .” “you know what? i’ll escort you home! if you yourself say that you’re weak, then . . .” “what about your guests? who’s that curly-haired fellow who just looked in here?” “that one? the devil only knows! he must be one of my uncle’s friends, or else he came on his own. . . . i’ll leave the guests with my uncle; he’s a most treasured man; it’s a pity you can’t meet him. but to hell with all of them! i don’t care about them now: i need to get some fresh air, so, my friend, you came at a good time. another two minutes and i’d have gotten into a fight, so help me god! they’re talking such nonsense. . . . you can’t imagine what sort of whopping lies a person can tell! but why can’t you imagine it? don’t we all tell lies? well, let them. later they won’t have to lie. . . . sit here for a minute, and i’ll bring zosimov over.” zosimov came rushing over to see raskolnikov, with some excitement. one could sense a special kind of curiosity in him, and soon his face brightened. “he needs to get some sleep immediately,” he decided, having examined the patient as best he could, “and take one dose before he goes to bed. will you do it? i prepared it before . . . one powder.” “even two of them,” replied raskolnikov. the powder was swallowed right there. “it’s a very good idea for you to escort him,” zosimov said to razumikhin. “we’ll see what tomorrow brings, but today he seems not bad at all: a significant change from yesterday. live and learn . . .” “do you know what zosimov whispered to me just now as we were leaving?” razumikhin blurted out as soon as they had reached the street. “i’ll tell you everything, because he’s such a fool. zosimov ordered me to chat with you along the way and make you talk, and then to tell him, because he has this idea . . . that you’re insane or close to it. just imagine! in the first place, you’re three times smarter than he is; in the second place, if you’re not mad, why should you give a damn about what sort of crazy ideas he has; and in the third place, that hunk of meat is a surgeon by specialty, and now he’s meddling in mental diseases. what encouraged him in that regard was the conversation you had today with zametov.” “did zametov tell you all this?” “he did, and a good thing he did. now i understand all there is to know, and so does zametov. . . . well, in a word, rodya . . . the thing is. . . . i’m a little tipsy right now. . . . but that doesn’t matter . . . the point is that this idea . . . do you understand? this idea took hold of them . . . do you understand? that is, no one ever dared utter it aloud because it’s such ridiculous nonsense, especially after they arrested that painter. all of this burst like a bubble and vanished forever. but why are they such fools? at the time i pounced a bit on zametov—this is just between us, my friend; please don’t even hint that you know about it; i’ve noticed that he’s prickly; it was at laviza’s—but today, today it’s all become clear. the"
dostoevsky,"main thing is ilya petrovich! he exploited your fainting spell at the police station, and then he himself was ashamed. i know that . . .” raskolnikov listened fervently. razumikhin was letting the cat out of the bag in his drunken state. “i fainted then because it was stuffy and smelled of oil paint,” said raskolnikov. “no need to explain! and it wasn’t only the paint: your illness had been coming on for a whole month. zosimov can swear to it! you can’t possibly imagine how demolished that fellow is now! ‘i’m not even worth that man’s little finger,’ he said. yours, that is. sometimes, my friend, he has good feelings. but the lesson, the lesson you gave him today at the ‘crystal palace’ was beyond perfection! at first you scared him, drove him into a fit! you almost convinced him all over again of that hideous nonsense and then, all of a sudden—you stuck out your tongue at him: ‘aha,’ you said, ‘so there!’ perfection! now he’s crushed, destroyed! you’re a master, so help me god, and serves him right. hey, too bad i wasn’t there! he’s been waiting eagerly to see you. porfiry also wants to make your acquaintance . . .” “ah . . . that one, too. . . . just why did they think i was insane?” “not insane exactly. it seems, my friend, i’ve said too much. . . . what struck him, don’t you see, is that only one thing’s been of any interest to you lately . . . now it’s clear why that’s so . . . knowing all the circumstances . . . and how much that irritated you then and became mixed up with your illness. . . . my friend, i’m a little drunk, but, damn it all, he has this idea of his own. . . . i tell you, he’s been meddling in mental illness. to hell with him!” for half a minute, both men remained silent. “listen, razumikhin,” began raskolnikov. “i want to tell you honestly: just now i was with a dying man, a civil servant who passed away. . . . i gave away all my money . . . in addition, i was kissed by a creature who, if i’d killed someone, would also have. . . . in a word, there i saw another creature . . . with a fiery-colored feather . . . but i’m getting all tangled up. i’m very weak; give me your arm . . . here’s the staircase . . .” “what’s the matter with you? what is it?” razumikhin asked anxiously. “my head’s spinning a bit, but that’s not the point; it’s that i’m feeling so glum, so very glum. just like a woman . . . i swear! look, what’s that? look here, look!” “what is it?” “don’t you see? there’s light in my room, don’t you see? through the crack . . .” they were now standing in front of the last staircase, next to the landlady’s door, and in fact there was light coming from underneath the door to raskolnikov’s little room. “that’s odd! perhaps it’s nastasya,” remarked razumikhin. “she never comes to my room at this hour. she must have gone to bed some time ago. but it doesn’t matter! good-bye!” “what do you mean? i’ll escort you; we’ll go in together!” “i know we’ll go in together, but i want to shake your hand here and say good-bye to you. well, give me your hand. good-bye!” “what’s the matter with you, rodya?” “nothing. let’s go: you’ll be a witness.” they began climbing the stairs, and the idea flashed through razumikhin’s mind that perhaps zosimov was right. “hey! i’ve upset him with all my chatter!” he muttered to himself. suddenly, approaching the door, they heard voices inside the room. “what’s all this about?” cried razumikhin. raskolnikov, the first to reach the door, opened it wide. he stood on the threshold like someone rooted to the ground. his mother and sister were sitting on the sofa in his room and had been waiting for him for the last hour and a half. why had he expected them least of all and thought about them least of all, in spite of the news he’d heard that very day that they were leaving, traveling, and were soon to arrive? for the last hour and a half they had vied with each other in interrogating nastasya, who was still standing before them and had already managed to tell them all there was to know. they were beside themselves with fear because they had heard that he had “run away today,” that he was ill, and, as was apparent from the story, he was certainly delirious! “my god, what’s the matter with him?” they were both weeping, and had endured great suffering during this last hour and a half of waiting. their joyful, ecstatic cry greeted raskolnikov’s appearance. they both rushed to him. but he stood there like a dead man. a sudden unbearable awareness struck him like a clap of thunder. he didn’t even raise his arms to embrace them: he couldn’t. his mother and sister took him in their embrace, kissed him, laughed, and wept. . . . he took a step, stumbled, and collapsed onto the floor in a faint. alarm, cries of fear, moans. . . . razumikhin, standing on the threshold, rushed into the room, grabbed the sick man in his powerful arms, and lay him down immediately on the sofa. “it’s nothing, nothing at all!” he cried to the mother and sister. “it’s only a faint. it doesn’t mean a thing! the doctor just said that he was much better, that he’s completely well! some water! there now, he’s already coming to. well, now he’s come around!” grabbing dunechka’s hand, in such a way that he almost tore it off, he forced her to see that “he’d already come around.” both mother and sister regarded razumikhin with tender emotion"
dostoevsky,"and gratitude, as if he had been sent by providence. they had already heard from nasta­sya what this “capable young man” had done for rodya all during his illness; that phrase was how pulkheriya aleksandrovna raskolnikova herself had described him in her intimate conversation with dunya that very evening. * the highest elected official in a province. † dostoevsky himself endured such an experience in ; he was pardoned and sent into exile. oceanofpdf.com i r askolnikov raised himself and sat up on the sofa. he motioned weakly to razumikhin to end his nonstop stream of incoherent and passionate words of consolation addressed to his mother and sister, took them both by the hand, and for a few moments stared in silence, first at one, then at the other. his mother was frightened by his gaze. a feeling akin to suffering showed through it, but at the same time there was something immobile, almost insane. pulkheriya aleksandrovna burst into tears. avdotya romanovna was pale, and her hand trembled in her brother’s hand. “go home . . . with him,” he said in a broken voice, indicating razumikhin. “until tomorrow. tomorrow everything will. . . . when did you arrive?” “this evening, rodya,” replied pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “the train was terribly late. but, rodya, i won’t leave you now under any circumstances! i’ll spend the night here next to . . .” “don’t torment me!” he said, waving his hand irritably. “i’ll stay with him!” razumikhin cried. “i won’t leave him for a single moment. to hell with all my guests. let them climb the walls! i left my uncle in charge.” “how can i ever thank you?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna started to say, giving razumikhin’s hands another squeeze, but raskolnikov interrupted her again. “i can’t stand it, i can’t,” he repeated irritably. “don’t torment me! enough! go away. . . . i can’t stand it!” “let’s go, mama, let’s just leave the room for a minute,” a frightened dunya whispered. “obviously we’re upsetting him.” “can’t i have a look at him after these last three years?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna said through her tears. “wait!” he stopped them again. “you keep interrupting me. my thoughts are getting all mixed up. . . . have you seen luzhin?” “no, rodya, but he already knows about our arrival. we heard, rodya, that petr petrovich was kind enough to call on you today,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna added with some timidity. “yes . . . he was kind enough. . . . dunya, i said to luzhin that i’d throw him down the stairs and i sent him packing . . .” “rodya, what are you saying? surely, you . . . you don’t want to say,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna started again in a fright, then paused, looking at dunya. avdotya romanovna stared intently at her brother and kept waiting. both had been informed about the quarrel by nastasya, as much as she could understand and relate, and they were worn out by suffering from incredulity and anticipation. “dunya,” raskolnikov continued with effort, “i don’t want this marriage to take place; therefore, first thing tomorrow you must refuse luzhin and never mention his name again.” “my god!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “brother, think about what you’re saying!” avdotya romanovna began to reply irascibly, but immediately restrained herself. “perhaps you’re not in a good state; you’re tired,” she said gently. “delirious? no. . . . you’re marrying luzhin on my account. but i won’t accept your sacrifice. therefore, by tomorrow, write him a letter . . . with your refusal. . . . give it to me to read in the morning. and that’ll be the end of it!” “i can’t do that!” the offended young woman cried. “what right do . . .” “dunechka, you’re also irascible. stop it. tomorrow we’ll. . . . can’t you see,” said her mother, rushing over to dunya. “ah, it’s better if we leave.” “he’s delirious,” cried the tipsy razumikhin. “how else could he dare? tomorrow all this nonsense will be a thing of the past. . . . but he really did drive luzhin away today. that’s what happened. and, of course, the fellow got very angry. . . . he went on at length, trying to show off his erudition, and then left, tail between his legs . . .” “so this is true?” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “until tomorrow, brother,” said dunya with compassion. “let’s go, mama. good-bye, rodya!” “do you hear, sister?” he repeated after them, gathering up his last strength. “i’m not delirious. this marriage is an abomination. i may be a scoundrel, but you mustn’t be. . . . it’s enough that one of us is. . . . and even if i am a scoundrel, i’ll never consider such a sister as my own. it’s either me or luzhin! now go . . .” “you’ve lost your mind! you’re a despot!” roared razumikhin, but raskolnikov made no reply. perhaps he didn’t have enough strength to answer. he lay down on the sofa and turned to face the wall in total exhaustion. avdotya romanovna regarded razumikhin with curiosity, her black eyes glowing; he even shuddered at her expression. pulkheriya aleksandrovna stood there stunned. “i can’t leave under any circumstances!” she whispered to razumikhin, almost in despair. “i’ll stay here, somewhere. . . . take dunya home.” “you’ll spoil everything!” razumikhin said, also in a whisper, losing his temper. “let’s at least go out onto the landing. nastasya, light the way! i swear to you,” he continued to whisper, already on the stairs, “just a little while ago he came close to beating us up, the doctor and me! do you understand? the doctor! the doctor complied so as not to irritate him and left. but while i remained on guard below, he got dressed and slipped out. and now, if you irritate him, he’ll slip out again at night, and he might do something to himself . . .” “oh, what are you saying?” “besides, avdotya romanovna can’t remain in"
dostoevsky,"the hotel alone without you! think about where you’re staying! why couldn’t that scoundrel petr petrovich have found you better rooms? but, you know i’m a little drunk and that’s why. . . . i called him names, but don’t pay any attention . . .” “i’ll go see the landlady here,” insisted pulkheriya aleksandrovna, “and beg her to give dunya and me a little room for the night. i can’t leave him like this, i just can’t.” while saying this, they stood on the landing, right in front of the landlady’s door. nastasya lit their way from a lower step. razumikhin was in a state of extraordinary excitement. just half an hour ago, while escorting raskolnikov home, although he had been excessively talkative, as he himself would admit, he’d been feeling completely fearless and almost renewed, in spite of the enormous quantity of alcohol he’d consumed that evening. now his mood resembled something like ecstasy and, at the same time, all the alcohol he’d consumed came rushing back to his head with redoubled force. he stood there with the two women, holding them both by the hand, trying to convince them, outlining his reasons with astonishing candor. most likely for greater persuasiveness, almost at every word, he squeezed both their hands ever so tightly, as if in a vise, almost until it hurt. he also seemed to be devouring avdotya romanovna with his eyes and was not in the least embarrassed about it. as a result of their discomfort, the women sometimes pulled their hands away from the bony grip of his enormous hands. not only did he fail to notice this, he drew them even closer to him. if they had commanded him to serve them by immediately casting himself headlong down the stairs, he would have done so at once, without considering or hesitating. agitated by the thought of her rodya, pulkheriya aleksandrovna, still felt that this young man was somewhat eccentric and was squeezing her hand too tightly. at the same time, she felt that he had been sent by providence, so she didn’t want to comment on these unusual details. in spite of her alarm, although avdotya romanovna was not a particularly fearful person, she felt some astonishment and perhaps even some fear when she met the flashing, fiery look in her brother’s friend’s eyes, and it was only the infinite trustworthiness inspired by nastasya’s accounts of this strange man that kept her from the temptation of escaping and dragging her mother after her. she also understood that perhaps it was no longer possible to get away from him now. after about ten minutes, however, she felt significantly calmer. razumikhin possessed the ability to say everything he had to say in an instant, no matter what sort of mood he was in, so that people realized very quickly who they were dealing with. “you can’t go to the landlady! that’s the worst thing you could do!” he cried, trying to convince pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “even though you’re his mother, if you stay here, you’ll make him furious, and then the devil only knows what might happen! listen, here’s what i’ll do: nastasya will stay here for now, and i’ll escort both of you to your rooms, because you can’t go out alone on the streets. in that regard, we have here in petersburg. . . . well, to hell with it! then i’ll rush back here and, in a quarter of an hour, my word of honor, i’ll bring you news: how he’s feeling, whether he’s asleep, and so on. now, listen! i’ll go back to my own apartment. i have guests, and they’re all drunk. i’ll grab zosimov, the doctor who’s treating him. he’s at my place now, but he’s not drunk. he’s not a drunkard; he never drinks! i’ll take him to see rodya and then bring him to you. in other words, within the hour you’ll hear two reports about him, one from the doctor, do you understand, from the doctor himself. that’s even better than from me! if it’s bad, i swear, i’ll bring you back here; if it’s good, then you can go to bed. i’ll spend the whole night here, in the entrance hall, and he won’t hear me. i’ll have zosimov spend the night at the landlady’s, so he’ll be right here if needed. so what’s better for him now, the doctor or you? the doctor’s more useful, much more. so, you can go home! you can’t go to the landlady. i can, but you can’t: she won’t take you in because . . . because she’s a fool. she’ll be jealous of avdotya romanovna on account of me, if you want to know, and on account of you, too. . . . but especially avdotya romanovna. she’s an absolutely extraordinary character, absolutely! however, i’m also a fool. . . . to hell with it! let’s go! do you believe me? well, do you believe me or not?” “let’s go, mama,” said avdotya romanovna. “he’ll do as he promises. he’s revived my brother. if it’s true that the doctor will agree to spend the night here, then what could be better?” “there, you . . . you . . . understand me because you’re an angel!” razumikhin cried in ecstasy. “let’s go! nastasya! come up here right now and stay with him. bring a candle. i’ll be back in quarter of an hour . . .” even though pulkheriya aleksandrovna wasn’t completely convinced, she no longer resisted. razumikhin took hold of both women’s arms and led them down the stairs. however, she was somewhat disconcerted: “even though he’s competent and kind,” she thought, “is he in any shape to do as he promises? he’s in such a state!” “ah, i understand. you think i’m in a state!” razumikhin said, interrupting her thoughts, having guessed them as he took his enormous strides along the sidewalk so that both women could hardly keep up, which, by the way, he didn’t even"
dostoevsky,"notice. “nonsense! that is, i’m dead drunk, but that’s not the point. i am drunk, but not from alcohol. it’s just that as soon as i saw you, the drink went to my head. . . . to hell with me! don’t pay me any attention. i’m lying and i’m not worthy of you. . . . i’m not the least bit worthy! after i’ve escorted you home, i’ll pour two buckets of cold water over my head right here in the canal, and i’ll be fine. . . . if you only knew how much i love you both! don’t laugh and don’t be angry! you can be angry with everyone else, but not with me! i’m his friend; consequently, i’m your friend, too. i so want to. . . . i felt this coming . . . last year, there was one moment when. . . . however, i didn’t really feel it coming since you seemed to arrive out of nowhere. perhaps i won’t sleep at all tonight. . . . before, this zosimov said he was afraid rodya might lose his mind. . . . that’s why one mustn’t get on his nerves . . .” “what are you saying?” cried his mother. “did the doctor really say that?” asked avdotya romanovna, growing frightened. “he did, but that’s not the point, not at all. he gave him some medicine, a powder, i saw it, and then you arrived. . . . hey! it would have been better if you’d come tomorrow! it’s a good thing we left. zosimov himself will report everything to you an hour from now. he’s not drunk at all! and i won’t be drunk then. . . . why did i get so smashed? because i got into an argument, damn them! i swore that i wouldn’t argue! they were spouting such nonsense! i almost got into a fight! i left my uncle there to preside. . . . well, would you believe it: they demand complete impersonality and delight in that! if only one could be other than oneself, or resemble oneself as little as possible! that’s what they consider the highest form of progress. if they would at least lie, each in his own way, but . . .” “listen,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna interrupted him timidly, but that merely fanned his fervor. “what do you think?” cried razumikhin, raising his voice even more. “do you think i’m not in favor of their telling lies? rubbish! i love it when they tell lies! lying is a privilege exclusive to humans among all other beings. it’s by lying that one arrives at the truth! i tell lies; therefore, i’m human. we haven’t arrived at any truths without having uttered nonsense beforehand fourteen or so times, perhaps even one hundred and fourteen times, and that’s honorable in its own way; well, we can’t even talk nonsense by relying on our own intelligence! you talk nonsense, but if it’s your own, i’ll kiss you for it. to talk one’s own nonsense is almost better than spouting someone else’s truth. in the first case, you’re a human being; but in the second, you’re only a parrot! truth doesn’t vanish, but life can be beaten to a pulp; there have been examples. well, where are we now? all of us, without exception, as regards science, development, thought, inventions, ideals, desires, liberalism, reason, experience, and everything, everything, everything, everything, everything—we’re still sitting in kindergarten! we’ve been pleased to make do with other people’s ideas—and we’ve gotten used to it! isn’t that so? aren’t i right?” cried razumikhin, shaking and squeezing the two women’s hands. “isn’t that true?” “oh, my god, i don’t know,” said poor pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “yes, yes . . . although i’m not entirely in agreement with you,” avdotya romanovna added earnestly. then she uttered a cry because he was squeezing her hand so tightly. “yes? you say it’s so? well, after this you . . . you . . .” he cried in ecstasy. “you’re a font of goodness, purity, reason, and . . . perfection! give me your hand, give it to me . . . give me yours, too. i want to kiss both your hands right here, right now, on my knees!” he fell to his knees in the middle of the sidewalk, fortunately deserted this time. “stop it, i beg you. what are you doing?” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna, agitated in the extreme. “get up, get up!” dunya said with a laugh, also agitated. “not for anything, not until you give me your hands! there now, enough. i’ve stood up. now let’s go! i’m an unhappy fool; i’m unworthy of you, i’m drunk, and i’m ashamed. . . . i’m not worthy to love you, but it’s everyone’s duty to bow down before you—if only they’re not complete beasts! and i have bowed down. . . . here are your rooms. for this reason alone rodion was right to drive petr petrovich away earlier! how dare he put you in such rooms? it’s a scandal! do you know who comes here? and you’re his fiancée! you are, aren’t you? well, i can tell you now that your fiancé’s a scoundrel!” “listen, mr. razumikhin, you’re forgetting yourself . . .” pulkheriya aleksandrovna began. “yes, yes, you’re right. i’m forgetting myself, i’m ashamed!” razumikhin corrected himself suddenly. “but . . . but . . . you can’t be angry with me for talking like this! i’m being sincere, and it’s not because. . . . hmm. that would be vile; in a word, it’s not because i . . . you. . . . hmm. well, so be it, there’s no need. i won’t say it; i dare not! we understood everything from the moment he walked in; he’s not a man of our circle. it wasn’t because he’d just had his hair curled at the barber’s, and not because he hastened to show off his intelligence, but because he’s a spy and a"
dostoevsky,"speculator; because he’s a yid and a buffoon, and that’s clear. you think he’s clever? no, he’s a fool, a fool! is he a match for you? oh, my god! you see, ladies”—he stopped suddenly, as he was now climbing the stairs to their rooms—“even though my guests are drunk, they’re all honest; and even though we’re talking nonsense, because i’m also talking nonsense, we’ll finally lie our way to the truth, because we’re on a noble path, while petr petrovich . . . is not on a noble path. although i’ve just cursed them soundly, i still respect them all; even though i don’t respect zametov, i still love him because—because he’s a puppy dog! even that beast zosimov, because he’s honest and knows his business. . . . but enough. everything’s been said and forgiven. it has been forgiven, hasn’t it? well, let’s go. i know this hallway, i’ve been here before. there was a scandal right here, in the third room. . . . so, where are you? what number? eight? well, lock the door at night and don’t let anyone in. i’ll be back in a quarter of an hour with news, and then zosimov will come a half hour later. you’ll see! good-bye, i’m off!” “my god, dunechka, what will happen?” said pulkheriya aleksandrovna, looking at her daughter, full of alarm and anxiety. “calm down, mama,” replied dunya, taking off her hat and cloak. “god himself sent us that gentleman, even though he’s come straight from some sort of drinking bout. i assure you that we can rely on him. just look at all that he’s already done for my brother . . .” “ah, dunechka, god only knows if he’ll come! how could i abandon rodya? that’s not the way i imagined we’d find him at all! he was so stern, as if he wasn’t glad to see us . . .” tears welled up in her eyes. “no, that’s not so, mama. you didn’t look closely, since you were crying all the time. he’s so distressed by his serious illness—that’s the whole reason.” “ah, the illness! something bad will happen, i’m sure it will! and the way he talked to you, dunya!” said her mother, looking timidly into her daughter’s eyes to read her thoughts, already feeling somewhat consoled that dunya was defending rodya and, therefore, must have forgiven him. “i’m sure he’ll reconsider tomorrow,” she added, still trying to probe. “but i’m certain he’ll say the same thing tomorrow . . . on this subject,” avdotya romanovna said, cutting her short. that, of course, was the catch, because it was the very point pulkheriya aleksandrovna was now too afraid to mention. dunya went up to her mother and kissed her. the latter embraced her warmly in silence. then pulkheriya aleksandrovna sat down in nervous anticipation of razumikhin’s return and timidly began to follow her daughter, who, folding her arms, also in anticipation, began pacing the room, deep in thought. such pacing from corner to corner in deep thought was avdotya romanovna’s usual habit, and her mother always feared interrupting her reflections at such times. razumikhin, it goes without saying, was preposterous with his sudden passion, fueled by drink, for avdotya romanovna; but, seeing her, especially now, as she was pacing the room, her arms folded, sad and pensive, perhaps many people would excuse him, without any mention of his extraordinary condition. avdotya romanovna was remarkably good-looking—tall, astonishingly graceful, and strong, with a self-confidence that showed in her every gesture and in no way excluded tenderness and gracefulness from her movements. her face resembled her brother’s, but she could even be called a beauty. her hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her brother’s. her eyes were almost black, sparkling, proud, and, simultaneously, at certain moments, unusually kind. her complexion was pale, but not sickly pale; her face shone with freshness and good health. her mouth was a little small; her lower lip, fresh and scarlet, protruded slightly forward, together with her chin—the single imperfection in this lovely face, but granting it a special quality and, incidentally, a slight arrogance. her expression was always more serious and thoughtful than cheerful; on the other hand, a smile suited her face so well, as did laughter, joyful, youthful, uninhibited! it is understandable how the passionate, candid, simpleminded, honest, strong as a folkloric hero, and inebriated razumikhin, never having seen anyone like that, would lose his head at first glance. besides, chance, as if intentionally, had revealed dunya for the first time at a splendid moment of love and joy at the reunion with her brother. he then saw how her lower lip trembled in indignation in response to her brother’s bold and ungratefully cruel commands—and he could not resist. however, he’d been telling the truth when, in his drunken state, he’d blurted out on the stairs that raskolnikov’s eccentric landlady, praskovya pavlovna, was jealous of him, not only with respect to avdotya romanovna, but perhaps also to pulkheriya aleksandrovna herself. in spite of the fact that pulkheriya aleksandrovna was already forty-three years old, her face still preserved traces of her former beauty; besides, she seemed much younger than her years, something that happens almost always with women who maintain their clarity of spirit, freshness of impressions, and honest, pure intensity of heart as they age. let us add in parentheses that to maintain all this is the only way to preserve one’s beauty even in old age. her hair was already starting to turn gray and grow thin; small, radiating wrinkles had appeared around her eyes some time ago; her cheeks were sunken and dry from her cares and grief; and yet her face was still beautiful. it was the image of dunya, only twenty years later, except for the look of her lower lip, since hers did not protrude. pulkheriya aleksandrovna was sensitive, though not to the point of affectation. she was shy and compliant, but only to a certain extent. she could"
dostoevsky,"concede a great deal, agree to many things, even those that contradicted her convictions, but there was always a limit to her honesty, her rules, and her deepest convictions that no circumstances would ever force her to cross. exactly twenty minutes after razumikhin’s departure there came his two soft but hurried knocks at the door: he had returned. “i won’t come in. i haven’t time!” he hastened to say when they opened the door. “he’s fast asleep, soundly and peacefully; god willing, he’ll sleep for ten hours or so. nastasya’s there; i told her not to leave until i get back. soon i’ll bring zosimov. he’ll report to you, and then you can get some sleep. i can see that you’re both completely exhausted.” he set off down the corridor. “what an efficient and . . . devoted young man!” exclaimed the extremely elated pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “he seems to be a splendid person!” replied avdotya romanovna with a certain passion, beginning to pace the room again. almost an hour later, steps were heard in the corridor and there was another knock at the door. both women were waiting, this time completely convinced by razumikhin’s promise; in fact, he had really managed to bring zosimov. he had agreed to leave the party immediately and have a look at raskolnikov, but had come to see the women unwillingly and with great uncertainty, failing to trust the drunken razumikhin. his self-esteem, however, was quickly soothed and even flattered; he realized that they really had been waiting for him as an oracle. he spent exactly ten minutes there and managed to convince them completely and appease pulkheriya aleksandrovna. he spoke with unusual sympathy, but with restraint and great earnestness, exactly as a twenty-seven-year-old doctor would at an important consultation. he didn’t stray from his subject with a single word and demonstrated no desire whatever to engage in more personal and private matters with the two women. having observed upon entering how dazzlingly attractive avdotya romanovna was, he tried all during his visit not to pay her any attention, addressing pulkheriya aleksandrovna exclusively. all this afforded him a sense of extreme inner satisfaction. as for the patient himself, he said that at the present time he found his condition to be extremely satisfactory. according to his observations, the patient’s illness, besides the poor material circumstances of the last few months of his life, had several other moral causes: “they were, so to speak, the result of complex moral and material influences, anxieties, apprehensions, problems, certain ideas . . . and so forth.” having noticed in passing that avdotya romanovna had begun listening especially carefully, zosimov developed this theme at somewhat greater length. in reply to pulkheriya aleksandrovna’s anxious and timid question concerning “certain suspicions regarding his sanity,” he replied with a calm and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated; that, of course, the patient had a certain idée fixe, something indicating monomania—he, zosimov, was now pursuing this extremely interesting branch of medicine—but it must be recalled that almost up until today the patient had been delirious and . . . and, of course, the arrival of his family would strengthen him, dispel these ideas, and have a salutary influence on him, “if only any new upsets could be avoided,” he added with emphasis. then he stood up, bowed imposingly and cordially, and was escorted out with blessings, warm gratitude, and prayers. avdotya romanovna even extended her own hand to him, and he left extremely satisfied with his visit, all the more so with himself. “we’ll talk tomorrow. now go to bed, right now, immediately!” razumikhin insisted, leaving with zosimov. “tomorrow, as early as possible, i’ll come with a report.” “what an entrancing girl that avdotya romanovna is!” remarked zosimov, almost licking his lips as the two of them emerged onto the street. “entrancing? you said entrancing?” razumikhin roared and suddenly threw himself at zosimov, grabbing him by the throat. “if you ever dare to . . . do you understand? do you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and pinning him against the wall. “do you hear me?” “let me go, you drunken devil!” zosimov struggled and then, after being released, looked closely at razumikhin and suddenly burst out laughing. razumikhin stood there in front of him, dropping his arms, in dark and serious thought. “of course, i’m an ass,” he said, black as a storm cloud. “but then . . . so are you.” “no, my friend, not at all. i’m not the one with absurd dreams.” they walked along in silence, and only when they arrived at raskolnikov’s apartment did razumikhin, feeling burdened by his cares, break the silence. “listen,” he said to zosimov. “you’re a fine fellow, but in addition to all your bad qualities, you’re a lecher, that i know, and one of the filthiest. you’re an anxious, weak scoundrel. you’re capricious and spoiled, and you can’t deny yourself anything—i call that filth, because it leads directly to filth. you’ve pampered yourself to such an extent that, i confess, least of all do i understand how you can be a good doctor, even a selfless one, with all this. you sleep on a feather bed (a doctor, even!), yet you get up at night to visit a patient! in three years or so, you won’t be getting up to treat anyone. . . . well, hell, that’s not the point, but this is: you’ll spend tonight in the landlady’s apartment (i managed to persuade her!), and i’ll be in the kitchen: this is your chance to get to know her better! it’s not what you think! there’s no hint of that, my friend . . .” “i’m not thinking anything at all.” “here, my friend, you’ll find bashfulness, reticence, shyness, strict chastity, and given all that—after a few sighs she’ll melt like wax, just like that! save me from her, for the sake of all the devils in the world! she’s a most charming creature! i’ll repay"
dostoevsky,"you with my life, i will!” zosimov started laughing even more than before. “you’re really smashed! what do i want with her?” “i assure you, it doesn’t take much. talk about whatever nonsense you want, but sit next to her and talk. besides, you’re a doctor, so you can begin to treat her for some ailment. i swear, you won’t regret it. she has a piano, and i strum on it a bit. i have one song, a russian one, genuine: ‘i weep bitter tears . . .’ she really loves it—well, it began with a song; but you’re a virtuoso on the piano, a maestro, a rubenstein. . . . * i assure you, you won’t be sorry!” “did you make any sort of promises to her? did you sign some document? did you promise to marry her, perhaps . . .” “not at all, not at all, nothing of the sort! she’s not that kind of woman. chebarov approached her . . .” “well, then drop her!” zosimov exclaimed. “it’s not that easy to drop her!” “why not?” “well, it’s just not, that’s all there is to it! there’s a complicating factor involved.” “why did you lead her on then?” “i didn’t lead her on at all. perhaps i myself was led on in my foolishness, but it’s absolutely all the same to her whether it’s you or me, as long as someone’s sitting next to her and sighing. here, my friend. . . . i can’t express it to you; here—you’re good at math, and i know you’re still studying now. . . . well, start explaining integral calculus to her, i swear i’m not joking. i’m being serious. it’s really all the same to her: she’ll look at you and sigh, and sit there for a whole year. by the way, for two days i was telling her at length about the prussian house of lords (because, what else is there to talk about with her?)—and all she did was sigh and sweat! but don’t start talking about love—she’s incredibly shy –show her that you can’t possibly leave her—well, that’s all there is to it. you’ll be terribly comfortable; just like home—read, sit, lie down, write. . . . you can even kiss her, but carefully . . .” “but why should i care about her?” “hey, i can’t explain it to you! you see, you two are so much alike! i already thought of you before. . . . you’ll end up like that! so, isn’t it the same, whether it’s sooner or later? here, my friend, is the beginning of a feather-bed life—hey, not only a feather bed! you’ll be drawn in. this is the end of the world, an anchor, a quiet refuge, the hub of the universe, the three great fishes on which the earth rests, the essence of pancakes, savory pies, an evening samovar, soft sighs, warm jackets, heated stoves—so it’s just as if you were dead, but also alive, all the advantages of both at the same time! well, my friend, hell, i’ve gone on and on. it’s time for bed! listen: sometimes i wake up at night. if so, i’ll go have a look at him. it’s nothing, nonsense, everything’s all right. don’t be alarmed. and you, you can stop by, too, if you like. but if you notice anything, delirium, for example, or fever, or something else, then wake me immediately. but that won’t happen . . .” * anton rubenstein (–) was a virtuoso pianist and founder of the st. petersburg conservatory. oceanofpdf.com ii r azumikhin awoke the next day before eight o’clock in an anxious and solemn mood. many new and unforeseen complications had suddenly arisen that morning. he had never imagined that he would awake in such a state. he recalled everything that had occurred the day before to the last detail and realized that something very unusual had taken place. he had experienced an impression the likes of which he had never felt before. at the same time, he was clearly aware that the dream, which had flared up in his imagination, was utterly unrealizable—so much so that he was even ashamed of it and quickly moved on to other, more important worries and complications that he had inherited after that “thrice-accursed yesterday.” his most terrible recollection was how “base and vile” he had seemed, not only because he was drunk, but because he had abused avdotya romanovna’s fiancé in the presence of the young woman, taking advantage of her situation and, as a result of his foolishly and hastily conceived jealousy, without any knowledge of their mutual relations and obligations, not even knowing the man properly. besides, what right did he have to judge petr petrovich so quickly and rashly? who had called upon him to judge? could a creature like avdotya romanovna give herself up to such an unworthy man for money? therefore, luzhin must possess good qualities. but those rooms? though how could he possibly have known what sort of rooms they really were? he was busy preparing their apartment. . . . phew, how base it all was! and what sort of defense was it that he was drunk? it was a stupid excuse that degraded him even more! in vino veritas, and now the whole truth had emerged, “that is, all the filth of his crude, envious heart!” was it in any way permissible for him, razumikhin, to harbor such a dream? who was he compared to such a young woman: just a drunken lout and yesterday’s braggart? “is such a disparaging and ridiculous comparison even possible?” razumikhin blushed desperately at this idea; all of a sudden, as if intentionally, at that very moment, he clearly recalled how he had told them yesterday, standing on the stairs, that the landlady was jealous of avdotya romanovna with regard to him. that was intolerable! he slammed his fist into the kitchen stove with all his might, hurting his hand and dislodging"
dostoevsky,"one brick. “of course,” he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-disparagement, “of course, it’s impossible to paint over or smooth out all these mean tricks. . . . therefore, it’s no use even thinking about it; from now on, i must appear before them in silence and . . . and fulfill my obligations . . . also in silence, and . . . and not ask their forgiveness, not say anything, and . . . and, of course, now all is lost!” nevertheless, while dressing, he scrutinized his apparel more carefully than usual. he didn’t have any other clothes; but even if he had, perhaps he wouldn’t have put them on. “just so, he deliberately wouldn’t put them on.” in any case, he could not continue being a cynic and a filthy slob. he had no right to offend other people’s feelings, all the more so since they needed him and were calling upon him. he cleaned his clothes carefully with a brush. his linen was always tolerable, and on that score he was particularly fastidious. that morning he scrubbed himself diligently, with soap provided by nastasya; he washed his hair, his neck, and especially his hands. when the question arose as to whether to shave his stubble or not (praskovya pavlovna owned an excellent razor that had belonged to her late husband, mr. zarnitsyn), the question was answered in the negative, even with some bitterness: “let it stay like it is! well, they might think i shaved especially . . . that’s just what they’ll think! not for anything on earth! “and . . . and the main thing is, he’s so crude, filthy, with manners of the tavern; and . . . and, let’s assume he knows he’s a decent fellow, at least a little. well, what’s there to be proud of in being a decent fellow? everyone should be decent, even better than that, and . . . still”—he remembers this—“there were certain matters . . . not exactly dishonorable, nevertheless, there they were! and what sort of thoughts had he sometimes harbored? hmm. and to put all this alongside avdotya romanovna! well, damn it all! so be it! i’ll be dirty, filthy, drunken, and to hell with it! i’ll be even worse!” zosimov, who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovna’s living room, came upon him in the middle of this monologue. he was heading home and, before leaving, had hastened to ask about the patient. razumikhin reported that he was sleeping like a log. zosimov ordered that raskolnikov not be disturbed until he awoke. he promised to call in sometime after ten. “if only he’s at home,” he added. “damn it! it’s hard to treat a patient when you have no control over his movements! do you happen to know whether he’s going there or they’re coming here?” “they’re coming to him, i think,” replied razumikhin, grasping the purpose of the question. “of course, they’ll be talking about family matters. i’ll leave. as a doctor, of course, you have more rights than i do.” “but i’m not a priest. i’ll come and go. i have many things to do besides them.” “one thing disturbs me,” added razumikhin, frowning. “yesterday, in my drunken state, as we walked home, i blabbed about all sorts of stupid things . . . various matters. . . . i said that you were afraid that he might . . . have a tendency toward insanity . . .” “you also said something about it to the women yesterday.” “i know it was stupid! you can beat me, if you like! but do you really have a strong opinion?” “it’s nonsense, i tell you. what sort of strong opinion? you yourself described him as a monomaniac when you called me in on the case. . . . well, yesterday we even fed the flames—that is, you did, with those stories . . . about the painter. fine to talk about that when it might have been the very thing that threatened his sanity in the first place! if i’d known in detail what had happened then at the police station, that some rascal had offended him there . . . with his suspicion! hmm . . . i wouldn’t have allowed that conversation yesterday. these monomaniacs can make mountains out of molehills; and they can believe the most fantastic stories. . . . as far as i can recall from yesterday, from zametov’s account, about half the matter came clear to me. so what? i know a case where one hypochondriac, some forty years old, was in no condition to tolerate everyday taunts at the table from an eight-year-old lad, and so he killed him! and here we have a man in tatters, an arrogant policeman, the beginnings of an illness, and such a suspicion! to a frenzied hypochondriac! in the presence of extraordinary, insane vanity! this might even be the source of his illness! well, to hell with it! by the way, this zametov really is a very nice young man, only . . . hmm . . . there was no need for him to say all that yesterday. he’s a terrible chatterbox!” “who did he tell? you and me?” “and porfiry.” “so what if he told porfiry?” “by the way, do you have any influence on the two of them, his mother and sister? they should be more careful with him today . . .” “they’ll come to an agreement!” razumikhin replied unwillingly. “and why did he attack luzhin like that? he’s a man of means, and she doesn’t seem repulsed by him. . . . and they’re broke, right?” “why are you interrogating me?” razumikhin cried irritably. “how should i know if they’re broke or not? ask them yourself. maybe you’ll find out . . .” “phew! how stupid you are sometimes! you’re still showing signs of yesterday’s drinking bout. . . . good-bye. thank praskovya pavlovna for me for last"
dostoevsky,"night’s lodging. she locked herself away and didn’t answer when i said ‘good morning’ through the door. she got up at seven o’clock, and her samovar was brought from the kitchen through the corridor. . . . i wasn’t worthy of beholding her with my own eyes . . .” at precisely nine o’clock, razumikhin appeared in the rooms at bakaleev’s. both women had been waiting for him for some time in hysterical impatience. they had been awake since seven, or even earlier. he entered in a mood as somber as night and greeted them awkwardly, for which he grew angry at once—at himself, of course. he was mistaken in his calculations: pulkheriya aleksandrovna threw herself at him, grabbed both his hands, and almost started kissing them. he looked timidly at avdotya romanovna; but at that moment her haughty face expressed gratitude, friendship, and such complete and unexpected respect for him (instead of mocking glances and the involuntary, badly concealed scorn he had expected!) that in truth it would have been easier for him if they had greeted him with abuse, because now it was all too confusing. fortunately, there was an easy topic for conversation, and he seized upon it quickly. after hearing that “he’s still not awake” but that “everything is all right,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna declared that it was for the best “since she very, very, very much needed to talk things over first.” there followed a question about tea and an invitation to have some together; they still hadn’t had their tea while waiting for razumikhin. avdotya romanovna rang the bell, and a filthy urchin appeared; he was told to bring tea, which was finally served, but it was so dirty and crude that the ladies were ashamed. razumikhin was about to criticize the rooms forcefully, but, recalling luzhin, he kept silent, felt embarrassed, and then was overjoyed when pulkheriya aleksandrovna’s questions finally rained down on him without interruption. replying to them, he spoke for three-quarters of an hour, constantly interrupted and cross-examined. he managed to convey all the most important and necessary facts he knew regarding the previous year of rodion romanovich’s life, concluding with a detailed account of his illness. he omitted, however, a great deal that needed to be omitted, including the scene at the police station, with all the consequences of that meeting. they listened eagerly to his account, but when he thought he had finished and had satisfied his audience, it turned out that as far as they were concerned, he had hardly begun. “tell me, tell me, what do you think. . . . ah, excuse me. i still don’t know your full name,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to add. “dmitry prokofich.” “well, then, dmitry prokofich, i’d very, very much like to know . . . in general . . . how he now regards things, that is, understand me . . . how shall i put it . . . that is, it’s better to say: what does he like and what not? is he always so irritable? what desires does he have, what dreams, so to speak, if it’s possible to say? what has the greatest influence on him now? in a word, i’d like to . . .” “ah, mama, how can he answer all these questions all of a sudden?” remarked dunya. “ah, my god, i never, never expected to meet him like this, dmitry prokofich.” “that’s only natural, ma’am,” replied dmitry prokofich. “i have no mother, but my uncle visits me every year and almost every time doesn’t recognize me, even my appearance, and he’s a clever man. a great deal of water has passed under the bridge during the three years of your separation. what can i tell you? i’ve known rodion for the last year and a half. he’s gloomy, somber, haughty, and proud. lately (perhaps for quite a while), he’s been worrying about his health; he’s a hypochondriac. he’s also generous and kind. he doesn’t like to talk about his feelings and would sooner seem cruel than reveal his heart. sometimes, however, he’s not a hypochondriac at all, but cold and callously insensitive. it’s almost as if there were two contradictory characters alternating within him. sometimes he’s terribly uncommunicative! he has no time for anything and everything bothers him, while he just lies there doing nothing. he’s not sarcastic, not because he lacks wit: it’s just that he has no time for such nonsense. he doesn’t wait to hear what people are saying. he never takes an interest in what interests other people at any given moment. he values himself very highly, and, it seems, has reason to do so. well, what else? it seems to me that your arrival will have an extremely beneficial effect on him.” “ah, god willing!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna, tormented by razumikhin’s account of her rodya. at last razumikhin looked more cheerfully at avdotya romanovna. during this conversation, he had glanced at her frequently but fleetingly, for only a moment, and then looked away immediately. avdotya romanovna either sat at the table, listening carefully, or stood up again and began pacing, as was her custom, from corner to corner, arms crossed, biting her lips, seldom asking a question, without interrupting her pacing, deep in thought. she also had the habit of not listening to what other people said. she was wearing a dark dress made of thin material, with a delicate white scarf tied around her neck. from many indications razumikhin observed that the circumstances of both women were extremely poor. if avdotya romanovna had been dressed like a queen, then, it seems, he would not have been the least bit afraid of her; but now, perhaps because she was so badly dressed, and he had noticed all these shabby circumstances, fear engulfed his heart. he began to fear his every word, every gesture, which, of course, would be embarrassing for anybody, especially for a person so unsure of himself. “you’ve said many interesting things about my brother’s character"
dostoevsky,"and . . . said it in an impartial way. that’s good because i thought you worshipped him,” remarked avdotya romanovna with a smile. “it also seems true that he should have a woman near him,” she added in a thoughtful mood. “i didn’t say that; but perhaps you’re also right about that; however . . .” “what?” “he doesn’t love anyone. perhaps he’ll never love anyone,” replied razumikhin abruptly. “that is, he’s incapable of loving?” “you know, avdotya romanovna, you’re terribly like your brother in all sorts of ways!” he blurted out suddenly, surprising even himself; but at once, recalling what he had just said about her brother, he turned red as a beet and became flustered. avdotya romanovna couldn’t keep from laughing as she looked at him. “you both may be mistaken about rodya,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna declared, somewhat offended. “i’m not talking about the present, dunechka. what petr petrovich writes in this letter . . . and what you and i believed may not be the truth, but you, dmitry prokofich, can’t imagine how prone to fantasy he is, and, how shall i put it, how capricious he is. i could never trust his character, not even when he was only fifteen years old. i’m sure that even now he could do something to himself that no one else could ever conceive of doing. . . . one doesn’t have to go far: do you know how, a year and a half ago, he astounded me, shocked me, and was nearly the death of me, when he decided to marry that girl, what’s her name—the daughter of this zarnitsyna woman, his landlady?” “do you know the details of that episode?” asked avdotya romanovna. “you think,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued passionately, “my tears would have stopped him then, my entreaties, my illness, my death, perhaps, from our anguish, our poverty? he would have calmly overstepped all those obstacles. but does he really, really not love us?” “he himself never told me a thing about that episode,” razumikhin replied cautiously, “but i heard something about it from mrs. zarnitsyna herself, who’s also not the most communicative person. what i did hear was really rather strange . . .” “what, what did you hear?” the two women asked together. “well, nothing much in particular. i merely learned that this match, already settled, and which didn’t take place only because of the bride’s death, was not at all to mrs. zarnitsyna’s liking. . . . besides that, they say the young woman was not very attractive, that is, they say she was even rather plain . . . and so sickly, and . . . and strange . . . however, it seems, she did have certain good qualities, or else there’d be no way to make sense of it. . . . there was no dowry at all, but then he wouldn’t even count on that possibility. . . . in general, it’s difficult to judge in such a matter.” “i’m certain that she was a worthy young woman,” avdotya romanovna observed curtly. “god will forgive me, but at the time i rejoiced at her death, although i really don’t know which of them would’ve ruined the other: would he destroy her, or would she destroy him?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna concluded. then, cautiously, with hesitations and constant glances at dunya, which, obviously, were not to dunya’s liking, she started to ask about the meeting yesterday between rodya and luzhin. that event, apparently, disturbed her more than anything, inciting fear and trembling in her. razumikhin related everything once more in detail, but this time he added his own conclusion. he bluntly accused raskolnikov of intentionally insulting petr petrovich, hardly using his illness as an excuse. “he had decided on this before he became ill,” he added. “i think so, too,” said pulkheriya aleksandrovna with a defeated look. she was very surprised that this time razumikhin was speaking about petr petrovich so cautiously, even with what seemed to be some respect. this also surprised avdotya romanovna. “what, then, is your opinion of petr petrovich?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna asked, unable to refrain from inquiring. “i can’t hold any other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,” razumikhin replied with resolution and passion. “i’m not saying this out of any vulgar politeness, but because . . . because . . . well, only because avdotya romanovna herself, voluntarily, was the one to choose him. if i reviled him yesterday, it was because i was dead drunk and even . . . insane. yes, insane, i lost my head, i went crazy, completely . . . and today i’m ashamed of it!” he blushed and fell silent. avdotya romanovna blushed deeply but didn’t break her silence. she hadn’t uttered a single word from the moment they had started talking about luzhin. meanwhile, pulkheriya aleksandrovna, without her daughter’s support, was apparently in a state of indecision. at last, hesitating and glancing constantly at dunya, she declared that now one circumstance concerned her greatly. “you see, dmitry prokofich,” she began. “i’ll be absolutely frank with dmitry prokofich, right, dunya?” “of course, mama,” avdotya romanovna remarked earnestly. “the point is,” she hastened to add, as if permission to communicate her sorrow had relieved her of a great burden. “today, very early, we received a letter from petr petrovich in reply to our notifying him of our arrival yesterday. you see, yesterday he was supposed to meet us at the station, as he’d promised. instead, a lackey was sent with the address of these rooms to show us the way, while petr petrovich told him to say that he himself would call on us today. instead, this letter arrived this morning. . . . it would be better if you read it yourself. there’s one thing that disturbs me a great deal . . . you’ll soon see what it is for yourself, and . . . give me your honest opinion, dmitry prokofich! you know rodya’s character best of all, and you can"
dostoevsky,"advise us best of all. i warn you that dunechka’s already decided the entire matter from the outset, but i, i still don’t know what to do, and . . . i’ve been waiting for you.” razumikhin unfolded the letter dated the day before and read the following: dear madam, pulkheriya aleksandrovna, “i have the honor to inform you that because of some sudden delays, i was unable to meet you on the platform, so i sent a very efficient fellow in my place. similarly, i must deprive myself of the honor of meeting you tomorrow morning, as a result of unavoidable business at the senate, and so as not to interfere with your intimate reunion with your son, and avdotya romanovna’s reunion with her brother. i shall have the honor of calling on you and paying my respects in your rooms no later than tomorrow, at precisely eight o’clock in the evening. moreover, i take the liberty of adding the earnest and, dare i say, insistent request that rodion romanovich not be present at our meeting, inasmuch as he insulted me unspeakably and impolitely during my visit to his sickbed yesterday. furthermore, i want to have a necessary and thorough discussion with you regarding one particular matter, about which i wish to learn your opinion. i have the honor of informing you in advance that if, in spite of my request, i meet rodion romanovich, then i will be compelled to leave at once, and you will have only yourself to blame. i am writing this on the assumption that rodion romanovich, who seemed so ill during my visit, suddenly recovered within two hours, and that consequently, leaving his own room, he may be able to visit you. i was convinced of this by my own eyes, having seen him yesterday in the apartment of a certain drunkard, run over by horses, who died as a result, and whose daughter, a young woman of notorious conduct, he handed up to twenty-five rubles yesterday, on the pretext of funeral expenses, a fact that shocked me greatly, knowing the difficult circumstances under which you acquired that sum of money. with that, and conveying my special regards to the respected avdotya romanovna, i beg you to accept my feelings of respectful devotion, your humble servant, p. luzhin. “what shall i do now, dmitry prokofich?” asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna, almost in tears. “how can i tell rodya not to come? yesterday he so insistently demanded that petr petrovich be refused, and now we’re told that rodya can’t be received! he’ll come on purpose, as soon as he finds out, and . . . then what will happen?” “do as avdotya romanovna has decided,” razumikhin replied calmly at once. “oh, my goodness! she says . . . god knows what she says, and she doesn’t explain her purpose to me! she says that it would be better, that is, not exactly better, but for some reason it would be absolutely necessary that rodya also deliberately come today at eight o’clock and that they meet without fail. . . . but i didn’t want to show him this letter at all, just somehow devise a trick, with your help, so that he wouldn’t come . . . because he’s so irascible. . . . and i don’t understand at all about that drunkard who died, and what sort of daughter he had, and how he could have given this daughter his last rubles . . . which . . .” “which cost you so dearly, mama,” added avdotya romanovna. “he was not himself yesterday,” razumikhin said pensively. “if you knew all that he’d said in the tavern, though it was clever . . . hmm! he really did say something to me yesterday about some dead man and about some young woman as we were going home, but i didn’t understand a word. . . . however, yesterday i, too, was . . .” “mama, it would be best if we went to see him, and then, i assure you, we’ll know immediately what to do. besides, it’s already time. good lord! it’s past ten o’clock!” she cried, glancing at the magnificent gold-and-enamel watch hanging around her neck on a slender venetian chain, at odds with the rest of her apparel. “a present from her suitor,” thought razumikhin. “ah, it’s time! it’s time, dunechka, it’s time!” pulkheriya aleksandrovna exclaimed. “he’ll think we didn’t come because we’re angry about yesterday. oh, my goodness.” saying this, she hastened to throw on her cape and put on her hat while dunechka also got dressed. razumikhin noticed that her gloves were not only worn but even frayed. the obvious poverty of their apparel managed to convey to both ladies a look of special distinction, which always happens with those who know how to wear humble clothes. razumikhin regarded dunechka with reverence and was proud to be escorting her. “that queen,” he thought to himself, “who mended her own stockings in prison looked like a real queen at that moment and even more so than during the most lavish festivities and regal entrances.” * “my goodness!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “did i ever think that i’d be so afraid of a meeting with my own son, with my dear, dear rodya, as i am now? i am afraid, dmitry prokofich!” she added, casting a timid glance at him. “don’t be, mama,” said dunya, kissing her. “it’s better to have faith in him. i do.” “ah, my goodness! i have faith, too, but i didn’t sleep a wink last night!” cried the poor woman. they left. “you know, dunechka, as i fell asleep toward morning, i suddenly dreamt of the late marfa petrovna. . . . all dressed in white . . . she approached me, took my hand, and shook her head at me harshly, so harshly, as if she was censuring me. . . . is that a good sign? ah, my goodness, dmitry prokofich, you still don’t know. marfa petrovna"
dostoevsky,"died!” “no, i don’t. who’s this marfa petrovna?” “it was a sudden death! just imagine . . .” “later, mama,” dunya interrupted her. “he doesn’t even know marfa petrovna.” “ah, you don’t know her? i thought you knew everything. forgive me, dmitry prokofich. these days i can hardly think straight. true, i consider that you’ve been sent to us by providence, and so i was convinced that you already knew everything about it. i think of you as family. . . . don’t be angry at what i say. ah, my goodness, what happened to your right hand? did you hurt yourself?” “yes, i did,” the overjoyed razumikhin mumbled. “sometimes i say too much speaking right from the heart, so dunya corrects me. . . . but, my god, what a little cell he lives in! is he awake? and that woman, his landlady, does she consider that a room? listen, you say he doesn’t like to speak his heart, so perhaps he’s fed up with my . . . weaknesses? won’t you help me learn to deal with him? how should i act? you know, i feel completely at a loss.” “don’t ask him too many questions about something if you see that he’s scowling. in particular, don’t ask him about his health. he doesn’t like it.” “ah, dmitry prokofich, it’s so hard being a mother! but here’s his staircase. . . . what an awful staircase!” “mama, you’re even pale. calm down, my dear,” said dunya, caressing her mother. “he should be pleased to see you, but you’re tormenting yourself,” she added, her eyes flashing. “wait a moment. i’ll look in first to see if he’s awake.” the ladies quietly followed razumikhin up the stairs. when they approached the landlady’s apartment on the fourth floor, they noticed that her door was slightly ajar and that two lively black eyes were peering at them from the darkness. when their glances met, the door slammed shut with such a bang that pulkheriya aleksandrovna almost cried out in fright. * a reference to marie antoinette (–), who was imprisoned in and executed the following year. oceanofpdf.com iii “b etter, he’s better!” zosimov cried cheerfully as they entered. he had arrived about ten minutes earlier and was seated where he’d sat yesterday, in the corner of the room on the sofa. raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, fully clothed, even carefully washed and groomed, something he hadn’t done for quite some time. the room filled up immediately, but nastasya still managed to get in behind the visitors and stood there listening. it was true, raskolnikov had almost recovered, especially compared to how he’d felt yesterday. but he was still very pale, distracted, and gloomy. on the outside he resembled a wounded man or someone suffering from great physical pain: his brows were knit, his lips compressed, his gaze inflamed. he said very little and that only reluctantly, as if under duress or fulfilling an obligation; a kind of uneasiness appeared at times in his movements. all that was missing was a bandage on his arm or a taffeta cover on his finger for him to look exactly like a man who, for example, had a painful abscess on his finger, or who had injured his arm, or something of that sort. however, even this pale and gloomy face lit up for a moment when his mother and sister came in, but it merely added to his expression of what seemed to be more concentrated torment, rather than his previous dreary distraction. the light soon faded, but the torment remained, and zosimov, observing and studying his patient with all the youthful fervor of a doctor just beginning his practice, was surprised to notice instead of joy at the arrival of his family, some painful hidden resolve to endure unavoidable torment for another hour or two. he saw later how almost every word of the ensuing conversation seemed to touch one of his patient’s sore spots and irritate it; but at the same time, he was somewhat surprised by raskolnikov’s ability to control himself today and to conceal the feelings of yesterday’s monomaniac, who had been goaded almost to the point of madness by the least word spoken. “yes, i myself can see that i’m almost well,” said raskolnikov, kissing his mother and sister affably, as a result of which pulkheriya aleksandrovna also beamed. “and i’m not saying that as i did yesterday, ” he added, turning to razumikhin and shaking his hand warmly. “i was even surprised by his looks today,” zosimov began, overjoyed by the new arrivals because he had lost the thread of his conversation with the patient some ten minutes before. “in three or four more days, if he continues to improve, he’ll be as good as he was before, that is, how he was a month or two ago . . . or, perhaps even three months. all this started a while back . . . right? now confess that you yourself might be to blame for it,” he added with a cautious smile, as if still afraid of irritating him somehow. “it’s very possible,” raskolnikov replied coldly. “i’m saying that,” zosimov continued, growing into his role, “because, for the most part, now your complete recovery depends entirely on you. now that it’s possible to converse with you, i wanted to impress on you the importance of putting aside the initial, root causes, so to speak, that influenced the onset of your morbid condition; then you’ll recover. if not, you’ll get even worse. i don’t know what those initial causes were, but you must know. you’re a clever man and, of course, you’ve observed yourself. it seems to me that the origin of your distress coincides in part with your leaving the university. you mustn’t remain without an occupation, because, it seems to me, work and a firmly established goal could help you immensely.” “yes, yes, you’re absolutely right. . . . i’ll return to the university as"
dostoevsky,"soon as possible, and then everything will go . . . as smooth as silk . . .” zosimov, who had begun dispensing his astute advice in part for its effect on the ladies, was, of course, somewhat puzzled when, having finished his speech and having glanced at his listener, he noticed the decidedly mocking smile on raskolnikov’s face. however, that lasted for only a moment. pulkheriya aleksandrovna immediately began thanking zosimov, in particular for his visit to their hotel room the evening before. “so, he came to see you last night?” asked raskolnikov, as if alarmed. “as a result, you didn’t get any sleep after your voyage?” “ah, rodya, all this happened before two o’clock. at home dunya and i never go to bed before two.” “i, too, don’t know how to thank him,” continued raskolnikov, suddenly frowning and lowering his head. “setting aside the question of money—you’ll excuse me for mentioning it,” he said, turning to zosimov, “i don’t know why i deserve such special attention from you. i simply don’t understand it . . . and . . . and i even find it uncomfortable that i don’t understand it: i’m speaking to you frankly.” “don’t be upset,” zosimov said with a forced laugh. “let’s assume that you’re my first patient. well, some of us who’ve just begun to practice medicine come to love our first patients as if they were our own children; some of them almost fall in love with them. i don’t have very many patients yet.” “i’m not even talking about him,” added raskolnikov, indicating razumikhin. “he, too, has had nothing from me except insults and worries.” “oh, what lies! you’re in quite a sentimental mood today, aren’t you?” cried razumikhin. had he been more perspicacious, he would have seen that there was no question of a sentimental mood; rather, something completely opposite was in play. avdotya romanovna noticed it. she was intently and anxiously observing her brother. “as for you, mama, i dare not speak about you,” he continued, as if he had been preparing a lesson that morning. “it was only today that i was able to imagine how you must have suffered here yesterday in anticipation of my return.” after saying this, suddenly and with a silent smile, he extended his hand to his sister. but this time some genuine, unfeigned feeling shone through his smile. dunya immediately grabbed hold of his hand and squeezed it warmly, overjoyed and grateful. it was the first time he had addressed her after yesterday’s disagreement. his mother’s face glowed with ecstasy and happiness at the sight of this definitive, nonverbal reconciliation between brother and sister. “that’s why i love him so!” whispered razumikhin, always inclined to exaggerate, turning forcefully in his chair. “he has these impulses.” “how well it all turns out,” his mother thought to herself. “he has such noble instincts, and how simply, delicately he’s resolved yesterday’s misunderstanding with his sister—merely by extending his hand with such a fine look. . . . he has such splendid eyes, and his whole face is so handsome! he’s even better-looking than dunya. . . . but, my goodness, what sort of clothes is he wearing? he’s so horribly dressed! the errand boy at afanasy ivanovich’s shop is better dressed! if only, if only i could rush up to him, embrace him, and weep—but i’m afraid, afraid . . . he’s such a . . . good lord! now he’s speaking so politely, but i’m afraid! what am i afraid of?” “ah, rodya, you won’t believe,” she began suddenly, hastening to reply to his remark, “how . . . miserable dunechka and i were yesterday! now all that’s over and done with and we can say that we’re all happy again. imagine, we came rushing over here to embrace you, almost right from the train, and this woman—ah, here she is! hello, nastasya! she suddenly tells us that you’re sick and delirious, that in your delirium you just slipped away from the doctor, and they’d gone out to look for you. you can’t believe what that was like! all at once i recalled the tragic end of our acquaintance lieutenant potanchikov, a friend of your father’s—you don’t remember him, rodya—he was also delirious, and he too ran away, and fell into a well; they managed to pull him out only a day later. of course, we imagined even worse things. we wanted to rush off in search of petr petrovich, so that at least with his help . . . because we were alone, completely alone,” she said in a plaintive voice and suddenly broke off, having recalled that mentioning petr petrovich was still rather dangerous, in spite of the fact that “everyone was completely happy again.” “yes, yes . . . all that, of course, is annoying,” raskolnikov muttered in reply, but with such a distracted and almost inattentive look that dunechka regarded him in astonishment. “what else was it that i wanted to say,” he continued, trying to recall. “yes. please, mama, and you, dunechka, don’t think that i didn’t want to visit you first thing today and that i was just waiting for you to come.” “what are you saying, rodya?” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna, also surprised. “is he responding like this from a sense of obligation?” dunechka wondered. “he’s making peace and asking for forgiveness as if he’s doing a job or reciting a lesson.” “i just woke up and wanted to come, but my clothes delayed me; yesterday i forgot to tell her . . . nastasya . . . to wash away the blood. . . . i’ve only managed to get dressed now.” “blood! what blood?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna cried anxiously. “it’s only . . . don’t worry. the blood was because yesterday, when i was wandering around in my delirium, i stumbled upon a fellow who’d been run over . . . a civil servant . . .” “in your delirium? but you remember everything,” razumikhin said, interrupting"
dostoevsky,"him. “that’s true,” raskolnikov replied, somehow in a particularly thoughtful way. “i remember everything, to the last detail, but just think: i really can’t explain why i did what i did, where i went, or what i said.” “that’s a very well-known phenomenon,” zosimov interjected. “the performance of acts is sometimes masterful, extremely clever, but the control of the acts, their origin, is confused and depends on various morbid impressions. it resembles a dream.” “it may be a good thing that he considers me almost insane,” thought raskolnikov. “but healthy people can experience something similar,” remarked dunechka, regarding zosimov uneasily. “that’s a rather accurate observation,” he replied. “in that sense, really all of us behave almost in a deranged manner, and extremely frequently, with only the slight difference that the ‘sick’ ones are somewhat more deranged than the rest of us, and therefore it’s essential to draw a distinction. it’s true that there’s almost no such thing as a completely well-balanced person; out of dozens, perhaps many hundred thousands, you meet only one, and he’s not a very good example . . .” at the word “deranged,” carelessly dropped by zosimov, who was getting carried away by one of his favorite themes, everyone winced. raskolnikov sat there, as if not paying any attention, in deep thought and with a strange smile on his pale lips. he continued pondering something. “so what happened to the man who was run over? i interrupted you!” razumikhin exclaimed hastily. “what?” said raskolnikov, as if awakening from a dream. “yes . . . i was splattered in blood when i helped carry him to his apartment. . . . by the way, mama, i committed an unforgivable act yesterday; i must have been out of my mind. yesterday i gave away all the money you sent me . . . to his wife . . . for the funeral. she’s now a widow, a consumptive, and a pitiful woman with three young orphans, hungry . . . no one at home . . . and there’s one more daughter. . . . if you’d seen it, you might have given away the money, too. . . . but, i confess, i had no right to do so, especially knowing how you came by it. to help, one must first have the right, or else: ‘ crevez chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents !’ * he laughed. isn’t that right, dunya?” “no, it’s not,” replied dunya resolutely. “well! you, too . . . have intentions!” he muttered, regarding her almost with hatred, smiling sarcastically. “i should’ve realized that. . . . well, that’s praiseworthy; it’s better for you . . . and you’ll reach a limit that you won’t overstep—and you’ll be unhappy; and if you do overstep, perhaps you’ll be even unhappier. . . . however, that’s all nonsense!” he added irritably, annoyed at his own involuntary passion. “i merely wanted to say that i ask your forgiveness, mama,” he concluded abruptly and sharply. “enough, rodya. i’m sure that everything you do is splendid!” said his mother, overjoyed. “don’t be so sure,” he replied, twisting his mouth into a smile. a moment of silence ensued. there was something strained in this entire conversation, this silence, reconciliation, forgiveness, and everyone felt it. “it’s as if they’re afraid of me,” raskolnikov thought to himself, scowling at his mother and his sister. and it was true that the longer pulkheriya aleksandrovna was silent, the more timid she really became. “it seems that when they’re far away, i loved them more,” flashed through his head. “you know, rodya, that marfa petrovna died?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna suddenly let drop. “who’s marfa petrovna?” “ah, my goodness, marfa petrovna svidrigaylova! i wrote you so much about her.” “ah, yes, i remember. . . . so she died? ah, really?” he suddenly roused himself, as if waking up. “so she really died? what from?” “just imagine: it was all very sudden!” pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to add, emboldened by his interest. “and it happened the same time i sent you that letter, that very day! just think, it seems that horrible man was the cause of her death. they say he gave her a terrible beating!” “did they really live like that?” he asked, addressing his sister. “no, even quite the contrary. he was always very patient with her, even courteous. in many instances he was even too indulgent of her character, all seven years. . . . somehow he suddenly lost his patience.” “of course, he was not that horrible if he held out for seven years. dunechka, you seem to be defending him.” “no, no, he’s a horrible man! i can’t imagine anyone more horrible,” dunya replied, almost with a shudder, frowning. she lapsed into thought. “it happened in the morning,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna continued hurriedly. “immediately afterward, she ordered the horses harnessed so she could drive into town right after dinner because in such cases she always did that; she ate her dinner, they say, with a large appetite.” “after the beating?” “. . . but she’d always had this . . . habit: as soon as she’d eaten her dinner, so as not to be late for her drive, she headed right to the bathhouse. . . . you see, she was taking some cure with her baths; they have a cold spring, and she used to bathe in it every day, as soon as she entered the water, she suddenly had a stroke!” “i should think so!” said zosimov. “was the beating severe?” “it doesn’t really matter,” replied dunya. “hmm! mama, what makes you talk about such nonsense?” raskolnikov said suddenly with irritation, and as if unintentionally. “oh, my dear, i just don’t know what to talk about,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna burst out. “are you all afraid of me or something?” he asked with a twisted grin. “that’s really true,” said dunya, looking directly and sternly at her brother. “when mama was coming up the stairs, she even crossed herself out of"
dostoevsky,"fear.” his face was suddenly distorted, as if from a convulsion. “ah, what are you saying, dunya? please don’t be angry, rodya. . . . why say that, dunya?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna asked in embarrassment. “it’s true that all the way here in the train i was thinking about how we’d get to see each other, how we’d talk about everything . . . and i was so happy that i didn’t even notice the long journey! but what am i saying? i’m happy even now. . . . you were wrong to say that, dunya! i’m just so happy to see you, rodya . . .” “enough, mama,” he muttered in embarrassment, squeezing her hand without looking at her. “we’ll have time to talk about everything!” after saying this, he suddenly became confused and turned pale. once again, the previous horrible sensation of deathly cold entered his soul; once again, it suddenly became completely clear and apparent that he had just told a terrible lie. not only would the time to talk about everything never come, but there was nothing further for him to talk about with anyone, ever. the impact of this tormenting idea was so strong that for a moment he almost forgot himself entirely. he stood up and, without looking at anyone, was about to leave the room. “what are you doing?” cried razumikhin, seizing him by the arm. he sat down again and began glancing around in silence; everyone regarded him in perplexity. “why are you all so tedious?” he cried suddenly, completely unexpectedly. “say something! why are you sitting here like this? well, speak! let’s start a conversation. . . . we’ve come together and we’re sitting here in silence. . . . well, say something!” “thank heavens! i thought that something like what happened yesterday was beginning again,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna said, after crossing herself. “what is it, rodya?” avdotya romanovna asked uncertainly. “it’s nothing. i just remembered something,” he replied suddenly and started laughing. “well, if that’s all it is, then it’s all right! or else, i also began to think . . .” zosimov muttered, getting up from the sofa. “but it’s time for me to go; i’ll drop in again, perhaps, and hope to find you here . . .” he bowed and left. “what a splendid man!” remarked pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “yes, splendid, outstanding, educated, clever . . .” raskolnikov started talking suddenly with unexpected speed and unusual animation not seen before. “i don’t recall where i encountered him before my illness. . . . it seems we met somewhere. . . . and this man’s also a fine fellow!” he nodded at razumikhin. “do you like him, dunya?” he asked suddenly and burst into puzzling laughter. “very much,” replied dunya. “phew, what a . . . swine you are!” razumikhin muttered, terribly embarrassed; he blushed and stood up from his chair. pulkheriya aleksandrovna smiled slightly, while raskolnikov roared with loud laughter. “where are you going?” “i . . . have to go, too.” “no, you don’t. stay here! zosimov left, so you think you should as well. don’t go. . . . what time is it? is it twelve yet? what a nice watch you have, dunya! why have you fallen silent again? i’m the only one talking.” “it was a gift from marfa petrovna,” replied dunya. “and a very expensive one,” added pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “ah! it’s so big, almost too big to be a lady’s watch.” “i like watches like this,” said dunya. “so then, it’s not a gift from her suitor,” thought razumikhin, and for some reason felt overjoyed. “i thought it was a present from luzhin,” remarked raskolnikov. “oh, no. he hasn’t given dunechka anything yet.” “ah! do you remember, mama, i was once in love and wanted to get married,” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was struck by the unexpected manner and tone with which he had begun talking about it. “ah, my dear, yes!” pulkheriya aleksandrovna exchanged glances with dunechka and razumikhin. “hmm! yes! what can i tell you? i don’t even recall much. she was a sickly girl,” he continued, growing thoughtful again, casting his eyes down. “very ill; she loved to give money to the poor; she kept dreaming about a convent and once burst into tears when she started telling me about it. yes, yes . . . i remember . . . i remember it well. she was very plain. . . . i really don’t know why i felt attracted to her; perhaps it was because she was always sickly. . . . if she’d been lame or a hunchback, i probably would’ve loved her even more. . . .” he smiled thoughtfully. “thus . . . it was some sort of springtime delirium . . .” “no, it wasn’t merely springtime delirium,” dunechka said with animation. he regarded his sister intently and intensely, but he hadn’t even heard or understood her words. then, in deep thought, he stood up, approached his mother, kissed her, returned to his seat, and sat down. “you still love her!” said pulkheriya aleksandrovna, touched. “her? now? ah, yes . . . you’re talking about that young woman! no, it’s as if it happened in another world . . . and so long ago. it seems that everything around me is happening somewhere else . . .” he regarded them closely. “even you . . . it’s as if i’m looking at you from a thousand miles away. . . . the devil knows why we’re talking about this! why do you keep asking?” he added in annoyance and fell silent, biting his nails and growing thoughtful once more. “you have such an awful room, rodya. it’s like a coffin,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna said suddenly, breaking the painful silence. “i’m sure that half the reason you became so melancholy is this room.” “my room?” he replied distractedly. “yes, my room certainly contributed to it. . . . i thought about that, too. if you"
dostoevsky,"only knew what sort of strange idea you just uttered, mama,” he added suddenly, smiling in a strange way. it would have taken just a little while longer and this company, these relatives, after a three-year separation, this intimate tone of conversation and the complete impossibility of talking about anything—all this he would have found absolutely intolerable. there was, however, one pressing matter that had to be resolved today, one way or another. he had reached this decision a while ago, when he awoke. now he rejoiced over that matter as an escape. “here’s what, dunya,” he began, speaking seriously and drily. “of course, i ask your forgiveness for what i said yesterday, but i consider it my duty to remind you once again that i’m not retreating from the main point. it’s either me or luzhin. i may be a scoundrel, but you shouldn’t be. it should be only one of us. if you marry luzhin, i’ll immediately cease thinking of you as my sister.” “rodya, rodya! this is the same as yesterday,” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna bitterly. “why do you keep calling yourself a scoundrel? i can’t stand that! it was just the same yesterday . . .” “brother,” replied dunya firmly and also drily. “you’re making a mistake here. i thought about it all night and found where you are mistaken. it lies in the fact that you assume that i’m sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. but that’s not true at all. i’m getting married for myself, because i find things difficult; of course, i’ll be glad if it also turns out to be of use to my family, but that isn’t the main reason for my decision . . .” “she’s lying!” he thought to himself, biting his nails in anger. “she’s an arrogant woman! she doesn’t want to admit that she’s doing it to benefit others! oh, these vile characters! their love is like hatred. . . . oh, how i . . . hate them all.” “in a word, i’m marrying petr petrovich,” dunechka continued, “because i’m choosing the lesser of two evils. i intend to fulfill honestly all that he expects of me; consequently, i’m not deceiving him. . . . why did you just smile like that?” she also flared up, and anger flashed in her eyes. “will you fulfill everything?” he asked, smiling maliciously. “up to a certain point. both the manner and the form of petr petrovich’s proposal revealed immediately what he’s looking for. of course, he values himself highly, perhaps too highly, but i hope that he’ll also come to value me. . . . why are you laughing again?” “and why are you blushing again? you’re lying, sister. you’re lying intentionally, out of feminine obstinacy alone, merely to get your own way with me. . . . you can’t respect luzhin: i’ve seen him and talked to him. consequently, you’re selling yourself for money; and, consequently, in any case, you’re behaving in a vile manner. i’m glad that at least you can still blush!” “it’s not true! i’m not lying!” dunechka cried, losing all her self-control. “i’m not marrying him without being convinced that he values me and appreciates me. i’m not marrying him without the firm conviction that i can respect him. fortunately, i can probably become convinced of this even today. such a marriage is not a vile act, as you say! and even if you were right, if i’d really decided to commit such a vile act, isn’t it really heartless of you to talk to me like this? why do you demand of me heroism that you yourself may lack? it’s despotism, coercion! if i’m to ruin someone, it’s only myself. . . . i haven’t murdered anyone. . . . why are you looking at me like that? why have you turned so pale? rodya, what’s the matter with you? rodya, my dear!” “good lord! you’re causing him to faint!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “no, no . . . nonsense . . . it’s nothing! my head started spinning a little. i’m not fainting. . . . all you ever think about is fainting! hmm! now, what was i saying? yes. how will you convince yourself today that you can respect him and that he . . . values you, was that what you said? it seems you said something about today? or did i mishear?” “mama, show petr petrovich’s letter to my brother,” said dunechka. with trembling hands, pulkheriya aleksandrovna handed him the letter. he took it with great interest. but even before he unfolded it, he abruptly looked at dunechka with astonishment. “it’s strange,” he mused slowly, as if suddenly struck by a new thought. “why am i making such a big fuss? why such a racket? marry whomever you like!” he said it as if to himself, but uttered it aloud and for some time looked at his sister, as if he was puzzled. at last he unfolded the letter, still maintaining a look of strange astonishment; then he began reading it slowly and attentively; he read it through twice. pulkheriya aleksandrovna was feeling particularly anxious; everyone was anticipating something extraordinary. “i find this surprising,” he began after some thought, handing the letter back to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular. “he’s here on business, he’s a lawyer, and even his conversation is so . . . affected, yet his letter is so illiterate.” everyone was stunned; that was not what they had expected. “but they all write like that,” razumikhin noted abruptly. “have you read it?” “yes.” “we showed it to him, rodya, we . . . conferred about it before,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna began in her confusion. “it’s in a special lawyerly style,” razumikhin said, interrupting her. “legal documents are still written like that.” “lawyerly? yes, that’s it precisely, businesslike. . . . it’s not that it’s very illiterate, and it’s not that it’s very literary; it’s just businesslike.” “petr petrovich doesn’t conceal the fact that he"
dostoevsky,"was educated on the cheap; he even boasts of having paved his own way,” remarked avdotya romanovna, somewhat offended by her brother’s new tone. “well, if he boasts, then he has something to boast about—i’m not contradicting him. you, sister, seem to have been offended by the fact that out of the whole letter i ventured such a frivolous remark, and you think that i mention such trivialities intentionally to make difficulties for you because i’m annoyed. on the contrary, concerning his style, an observation occurred to me that in this present case is not at all superfluous. there’s one expression in the letter, ‘you will have only yourself to blame,’ that puts it all very pointedly and clearly. in addition, there’s the threat that if i attend the meeting, he’ll leave immediately. this threat to leave—it’s the same as a threat to abandon you both if you disobey him, and to abandon you now, after he’s brought you to petersburg. well, what do you think? would one take offense at such an expression like luzhin’s, if he”—indicating razumikhin—“had written it, or zosimov, or one of us?” “n-no,” replied dunechka, growing more animated. “i understood very well that it was expressed too artlessly and that perhaps he’s not a very skilled writer. . . . you’re absolutely right, brother. i didn’t even expect that . . .” “it’s written in legalese, and it can’t be written in any other way; it came out more crudely than he might have wanted. besides, i have to disillusion you somewhat: there’s another expression in this letter that’s a slander against me, and a rather vile one. i gave the money yesterday to a consumptive woman, a devastated widow, not ‘on the pretext of funeral expenses,’ but directly for the funeral, and not to the daughter—‘a young woman of notorious conduct’ as he writes (and whom i saw for the first time in my life yesterday), but to the widow herself. in all of this i see his overly hasty desire to tarnish me and provoke a quarrel with you. again, it’s expressed in legalese, that is, with too obvious a display of its own aim and with extremely naïve speed. he’s an intelligent man, but in order to act intelligently—intelligence alone is not enough. all this provides a picture of the man . . . and i don’t think he values you very highly. i say all this solely for your own edification, because i sincerely want the best for you . . .” dunechka made no reply; her decision had been made some time ago, and she was merely waiting for evening to arrive. “well, what have you decided, rodya?” asked pulkheriya aleksandrovna, even more worried than before by his sudden, new, businesslike tone. “what do you mean, ‘decided’?” “petr petrovich writes that he doesn’t want you there this evening and that he’ll leave . . . if you come. so then . . . will you be here?” “that, of course, is not for me to decide, but you, in the first place, if petr petrovich’s demand does not offend you; and dunya, in the second place, if she’s not offended, either. i shall do as you wish,” he added coolly. “dunechka’s already decided, and i’m in complete agreement with her,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to say. “i decided to ask you, rodya, to request most urgently that you be present at this meeting,” said dunya. “will you come?” “i will.” “and i also ask you,” she said, turning to razumikhin, “to join us here at eight o’clock. mama, i’m also inviting him.” “that’s fine, dunechka. well, just as you’ve decided,” added pulkheriya aleksandrovna, “that’s how it will be. i myself feel better. i don’t like to pretend or lie. it’s better to speak the whole truth . . . whether it makes petr petrovich angry or not.” * “die dogs, if you’re not happy!” (french). oceanofpdf.com iv a t that moment, the door opened quietly and a young woman entered the room, glancing around timidly. everyone turned to her with astonishment and curiosity. raskolnikov didn’t recognize her at first. it was sofiya semyonovna marmeladova. he’d seen her yesterday for the first time, but at such a moment, in such circumstances, and in such clothes, that he remembered an entirely different face. now she was a modestly, even poorly dressed young woman, very young indeed, almost like a girl, with modest, proper manners, and an innocent but seemingly frightened face. she was wearing a very simple everyday dress and an old, outmoded hat on her head; but she was carrying a parasol in her hands, as she had yesterday. unexpectedly seeing a room full of people, she wasn’t merely embarrassed, but overwhelmed; she felt timid as a child and even made a move to leave. “ah . . . is it you?” asked raskolnikov in extreme surprise, and he suddenly felt embarrassed. he remembered at once that his mother and sister already knew in passing, from luzhin’s letter, about a certain young woman of “notorious” conduct. he had just now been protesting against luzhin’s slander and had just acknowledged that he had seen this girl for the first time, when suddenly she herself showed up in his room. he also recalled that he hadn’t objected in any way to the phrase “notorious conduct.” all this flashed through his mind vaguely in one moment. but, glancing at her more intently, he quickly saw that this humbled creature was feeling so humiliated, and he suddenly felt sorry for her. when she made a move to run away out of fear, it was as if something turned over in him. “i wasn’t expecting you,” he hastened to say, stopping her with his glance. “be so good as to take a seat. you’ve probably come from katerina ivanovna. excuse me, not here. sit over there . . .” at sonya’s entrance razumikhin, who was seated on one of raskolnikov’s three chairs, at once stood up next"
dostoevsky,"to the door to let her pass. raskolnikov was about to show her to the place on the corner of the sofa where zosimov had sat but, remembering that the sofa would be too intimate a place and that it also served as his bed, he hastened to point her toward what had been razumikhin’s chair. “and you sit here,” he said to razumikhin, placing him in the corner zosimov had occupied. sonya sat down, almost trembling in fear, and glanced timidly at both women. it was clear that she herself didn’t understand how she could sit next to them. after realizing this, she was so frightened that she suddenly stood up again and turned to raskolnikov in total confusion. “i . . . i . . . came by only for a minute. forgive me for disturbing you,” she began, stammering. “i’ve come from katerina ivanovna; she had no one else to send. . . . katerina ivanovna wants me to implore you to attend the funeral tomorrow morning . . . during the morning service . . . at the mitrofanyevsky cemetery, and then to come to our apartment . . . to her place . . . for some refreshment. . . . she’d be honored. . . . she had me invite you.” sonya stuttered and fell silent. “i’ll certainly try . . . certainly,” replied raskolnikov, also standing, also stammering, and not finishing what he was saying. “be so good as to take a seat,” he said suddenly. “i have to talk to you. please—perhaps you’re in a hurry—be so kind as to give me a few moments of your time . . .” he pulled up a chair for her. sonya sat down again, once more glanced hurriedly, timidly, uncomfortably at the two women, and suddenly lowered her eyes. raskolnikov’s pale face flushed; he seemed to shudder all over; his eyes flashed. “mama,” he said firmly and insistently, “this is sofiya semyonovna marmeladova, the daughter of that unfortunate mr. marmeladov who was run over by horses yesterday before my very eyes and about whom i told you already . . .” pulkheriya aleksandrovna glanced at sonya, squinting slightly. in spite of all her confusion when faced with rodya’s insistent and challenging gaze, there was no way she could deny herself this pleasure. dunechka earnestly and intently stared directly at the poor young woman’s face and examined her in bewilderment. sonya, after hearing the introduction, was about to raise her eyes again, but felt even more embarrassed than before. “i wanted to ask you,” raskolnikov said, turning to her abruptly, “how have things been today? did anyone disturb you at all? the police, for example?” “no, sir, it all went. . . . it was all too clear what caused his death; they didn’t disturb us; it’s just that the lodgers were angry.” “why?” “the body was there for so long . . . it’s hot now and the smell. . . . so today, just before vespers, they’ll take it to the cemetery and it’ll be in the chapel until tomorrow. at first katerina ivanovna didn’t want that, but now she sees that there’s no other way . . .” “so today?” “she asks that you do us the honor of attending the funeral in the church tomorrow, and then come to a repast at our place.” “she’s arranging a wake?” “yes, sir. some refreshment. she asked me to thank you very much for helping us yesterday. . . . without you, we wouldn’t have had any way of burying him.” both her lips and her chin suddenly began trembling, but she regained control, refrained from crying, and quickly lowered her eyes to the floor again. during the conversation raskolnikov examined her closely. she had a thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular, somewhat angular, with a pointed little nose and chin. it was even impossible to think of her as pretty; on the other hand, her blue eyes were so clear and, when they came to life, the expression of her face so kind and sincere, that one felt involuntarily attracted to her. there was, in addition, one special trait reflected in her face and in her entire figure: in spite of her eighteen years, she still seemed like a young girl, much younger than her years, almost a total child, and that fact sometimes appeared engagingly in several of her movements. “but how could katerina ivanovna, with such meager means, arrange things, even provide refreshment?” asked raskolnikov, prolonging the conversation intentionally. “the coffin will be a simple one, sir . . . everything will be simple and inexpensive. . . . katerina ivanovna and i recently calculated it all, and there’s enough to provide for the funeral repast. . . . katerina ivanovna would very much like it this way. one can’t just . . . it would console her, sir . . . as you know, she’s like that . . .” “i understand, i do . . . of course. . . . why are you examining my room? my mother also says that it resembles a coffin.” “you gave us all your money yesterday!” sonechka replied suddenly, in a strong and swift whisper, and then suddenly dropped her eyes again. her lips and chin began trembling once more. she’d been struck for some time by raskolnikov’s impoverished circumstances, and just now these words had emerged all by themselves. a moment of silence ensued. dunechka’s eyes grew clear, and pulkheriya aleksandrovna even looked kindly at sonya. “rodya,” she said, standing up. “of course, we’ll have dinner together. dunechka, let’s go. . . . and you, rodya, should go out, take a little walk, have a rest, lie down, and then come to see us soon. . . . as things are, i’m afraid we’ve exhausted you . . .” “yes, yes, i’ll come,” he replied, rising and hurrying. . . . “i have some matters to attend to ."
dostoevsky,". .” “are you really planning to have dinner apart?” cried razumikhin, looking at raskolnikov in surprise. “why are you doing that?” “yes, yes, i’ll come, of course, of course, i will. . . . but you stay here for a moment longer. do you need him right now, mama? or can i perhaps take him away from you?” “oh, no, no! dmitry prokofich, will you be so good as to come and have dinner with us?” “please come,” dunya added. razumikhin bowed in farewell and shone with pleasure. for a moment, everyone suddenly felt strangely embarrassed. “good-bye, rodya, that is, until we meet; i don’t like saying ‘good-bye.’ good-bye, nastasya . . . oh, i just said it again!” pulkheriya aleksandrovna was also about to bow to sonechka, but somehow didn’t manage it; she left the room hastily. but avdotya romanovna seemed to wait her turn and, following her mother past sonya, said farewell with a thoughtful, polite, and deep bow. sonechka was embarrassed, and bowed somewhat hastily and fearfully, even with some painful sensation reflected in her face, as if she found avdotya romanovna’s politeness and thoughtfulness burdensome and distressing. “good-bye, dunya,” cried raskolnikov from the entrance hall. “give me your hand!” “i already did. have you forgotten?” replied dunya, affectionately and awkwardly turning to him. “so what? give me your hand again!” he squeezed her fingers warmly. dunechka smiled at him, blushed, quickly withdrew her hand, and followed her mother out, also feeling happy for some reason. “well, this is splendid!” he said to sonya, returning to his room and looking directly at her. “god grant eternal peace to the departed and allow the living to go on living! isn’t that so? isn’t it? right?” sonya looked at his suddenly brightening countenance with absolute astonishment; he stared intently at her in silence for several moments. at that minute, the whole story of her late father suddenly flashed into his memory . . . “good lord, dunechka!” said pulkheriya aleksandrovna, as soon as they had gone outside. “i’m almost glad that we left him now: it’s quite a relief. did i ever think yesterday in the train that i’d feel grateful for this?” “i tell you once more, mama, he’s still very sick. don’t you see that? perhaps he was worrying about us and that’s what distressed him. we have to be merciful and forgive him a great many things.” “you weren’t very merciful with him!” pulkheriya aleksandrovna immediately interrupted her, passionately and jealously. “you know, dunya, i was looking at both of you. you’re the spit and image of him, not merely in your looks as much as in your souls. you’re both melancholic, both moody and hot-tempered, both haughty, and both generous. . . . it couldn’t be that he’s an egoist, right, dunechka? but when i think about what’ll happen this evening, my heart grows cold!” “don’t worry, mama. what must be, will be.” “dunechka! just think about the predicament we’re in now! what if petr petrovich refuses?” poor pulkheriya aleksandrovna suddenly said unwisely. “then what will he be worth afterward?” dunechka replied abruptly and scornfully. “it’s a good thing we left now,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to add, interrupting her. “he was rushing to attend to some matter. let him go for a walk, get some fresh air. . . . it’s so terribly stuffy in his room. . . . how can anyone breathe here? even outside it’s like being in a room without ventilation. good lord, what a city! hold on, move to one side, or you’ll be crushed, they’re carrying something! they’re moving a piano. . . . how they’re struggling. . . . i’m also afraid of that girl . . .” “what girl, mama?” “that one, sofiya semyonovna, who was just there . . .” “why?” “i just have a foreboding, dunya. well, whether you believe it or not, as soon as she came in, at that very moment the thought occurred to me that this is where the main problem lies . . .” “nothing of the sort!” cried dunya in annoyance. “you and your forebodings, mama! he’s only known her since yesterday, and he didn’t even recognize her when she entered.” “well, you’ll see! she troubles me; you’ll see, you will. i was so frightened: she looked at me, really looked. her eyes are so . . . i could hardly keep to my chair. do you recall how he started to introduce her? it seems strange: petr petrovich wrote about her in such a way, yet he still introduced her to us, especially to you! therefore, she must mean something to him!” “it doesn’t matter what he wrote! people have said things about us and written things, too, or did you forget? i’m sure that she’s . . . she’s very nice, and all this is nonsense!” “god willing!” “and petr petrovich is a worthless gossip,” dunechka suddenly blurted out. pulkheriya aleksandrovna winced. the conversation ended. “here’s what i wanted to discuss with you,” raskolnikov said, leading razumikhin over to the window . . . “so i’ll tell katerina ivanovna that you’ll come,” sonya hastened to say, bowing to take her leave. “one minute, sofiya semyonovna. we have no secrets; you’re not interfering. . . . i’d still like to have a few words with you. . . . here’s what,” he said, breaking off without finishing and turning back suddenly to razumikhin. “do you know that fellow . . . what’s his name? porfiry petrovich?” “i’ll say i do! he’s a relative. what of it?” he added, his curiosity suddenly aroused. “he’s now involved with . . . well, that murder case . . . just yesterday you said something . . .” “yes . . . and?” razumikhin asked, his eyes suddenly open wide. “he’s been summoning people who pawned various items with her; i also had some pledges there, some trifles: my sister’s ring, which she gave me as a keepsake when i came"
dostoevsky,"here, and my father’s silver watch. all together they’re worth about five or six rubles, but they’re valuable to me as mementos. so what can i do now? i don’t want them to be lost, especially the watch. i was afraid that my mother would ask to see it when they began talking about dunechka’s watch. it’s the only thing left of my father’s. she’d be very upset if it were to disappear! women! so, what should i do, tell me! i know that i should declare it at the police station. wouldn’t it be better to tell porfiry petrovich himself? what do you think? it’s best to deal with it as soon as possible. you’ll see: mama will ask about it before dinner!” “by no means at the police station, but absolutely to porfiry!” cried razumikhin with some unusual agitation. “well, i’m so very glad! why wait? let’s go there right now; it’s not far away, and we’ll certainly find him in!” “fine . . . let’s go . . .” “he’ll be very, very, very glad to make your acquaintance! i’ve told him so much about you at different times. . . . just yesterday i was talking about you. let’s go! so, you knew that old woman? aha! it’s all turned out so mag-ni-fi-cent-ly! ah, yes, sofiya ivanovna . . .” “sofiya semyonovna,” raskolnikov corrected him. “sofiya semyonovna. this is my friend razumikhin, a good fellow . . .” “if you have to go now . . .” sonya started to say, without so much as looking at razumikhin, and, as a result, became even more embarrassed. “let’s go,” decided raskolnikov. “i’ll call on you later today, sofiya semyonovna. only tell me where you live.” it wasn’t that he had lost his train of thought, but he seemed to be hurrying and avoiding her gaze. sonya gave him her address, blushing. everyone left together. “don’t you lock your door?” asked razumikhin, following them down the stairs. “never! for the last two years i’ve been wanting to buy a lock,” he added casually. “happy are those who have no reason to lock their doors, right?” he said with a laugh, turning to sonya. when they reached the street, they paused at the gate. “are you turning right, sofiya semyonovna? by the way, how did you find me?” he asked, as if he’d intended to say something completely different. he still wanted to look into her soft, clear eyes, but somehow couldn’t manage it . . . “you gave your address to polechka yesterday.” “polya? ah, yes . . . polechka! the little girl. . . . is she your sister? so, i gave her my address?” “yes. did you forget?” “no . . . i remember . . .” “and i’d heard about you before, from my late father. . . . but i didn’t know your full name then, and he didn’t, either. . . . but when i came today, since i learned your name yesterday . . . today i asked, ‘where does mr. raskolnikov live?’ i didn’t know you also rent a room from lodgers. . . . good-bye, sir. . . . i’ll tell katerina ivanovna . . .” she was terribly glad that she’d finally gotten away; she went in haste, her eyes cast down, to get out of their sight as quickly as she could, to cover the twenty paces to the right turn as soon as possible, and to be alone at last; then she could proceed, in haste, without looking at anyone, without noticing anything, to think, recall, and ponder every word that had been uttered, each and every circumstance of the visit. never, never before had she felt anything like this. an entirely new world, mysterious and vague, had entered her soul. she suddenly recalled that raskolnikov himself planned to call on her today, perhaps even that morning, perhaps right now! “but not today, please not today!” she muttered with a sinking heart, as if imploring someone like a frightened child. “good lord! call on me . . . in that room. . . . he’ll see. . . . oh, lord!” of course, at that moment she was unable to observe an unfamiliar gentleman following closely on her heels. he had been following her from the moment she had emerged from the gate. when all three of them, razumikhin, raskolnikov, and sonya, had paused to say a few words on the sidewalk, this person walking by, passing them, suddenly shuddered, accidentally overhearing her words “i asked, ‘where does mr. raskolnikov live?’ ” he swiftly but carefully surveyed the three of them, especially raskolnikov, to whom sonya was speaking. then he looked at the house and took note of it. all this happened in a moment, while walking, and the passerby, trying not to let his interest show, went on farther, reducing his speed, as if waiting for someone. he was waiting for sonya; he saw that they were saying their good-byes and that she was heading straight home. “but where was that? i’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought, recalling sonya’s features. “i must find out.” upon reaching the corner, he crossed to the opposite side of the street, turned around, and saw that sonya was now following him, along the same street, not noticing anything. upon reaching the corner, she also turned into that street. he followed from the opposite sidewalk without taking his eyes off her; after covering about fifty paces, he crossed again to the side sonya was on, caught up with her, and followed her, staying about five paces back. he was about fifty, taller than average, portly, with broad, sloping shoulders that gave him something of a stooped look. he was fashionably and comfortably dressed and looked like a stately gentleman. he was carrying a beautiful cane, which he tapped on the sidewalk at every step, and he was wearing new gloves. his broad face, with prominent cheekbones, was rather pleasant; his"
dostoevsky,"complexion was fresh, not typical of petersburg. his hair, still very thick, was completely fair, showing only a little gray; his full, thick beard, in the shape of a spade, was even lighter in color than his hair. his eyes were blue and his gaze was cold, intent, and thoughtful; his lips were red. in general he was an extremely well-preserved man who seemed much younger than his years. when sonya reached the canal, they found themselves together on the sidewalk. observing her, he noticed how pensive and distracted she was. upon reaching her house, sonya turned in at the gate; he followed her and seemed to be somewhat surprised. entering the courtyard, she turned right, toward the corner where a staircase led up to her apartment. “bah!” muttered the unfamiliar gentleman, and he began climbing the stairs after her. only then did sonya notice him. she reached the third floor, turned down the long hallway, and rang the bell at number : on the door, written in chalk, were the words kapernaumov. tailor . “bah!” the stranger repeated, struck by the strange coincidence, and he rang the bell next door, at number . the two doors were only about six paces apart. “you’re staying at the kapernaumovs’!” he said, looking at sonya and laughing. “he mended my vest yesterday. i live here, next to you, at madame resslikh’s, gertruda karlovna. how things have turned out!” sonya looked at him attentively. “we’re neighbors,” he continued in a particularly cheerful way. “this is only my third day in town. well, good-bye for now.” sonya made no reply; the door opened, and she slipped into her apartment. she felt ashamed for some reason, even a bit timid . . . razumikhin was in a particularly excited state as they walked to porfiry’s. “this is excellent, my friend,” he repeated several times. “i’m so glad, so very glad!” “what are you so glad about?” raskolnikov wondered to himself. “i didn’t know that you also had some pledges with the old woman. and . . . and . . . was it a long time ago? that is, has it been a while since you were there?” “what a naïve fool is he!” “when was it?” raskolnikov paused, trying to remember. “it seems i was there about three days before her death. however, i’m not going there now to redeem those items,” he said with some haste and special concern for his belongings. “once again i have only one silver ruble . . . thanks to my damned delirium yesterday!” he placed particular emphasis on the word “delirium.” “well, yes, yes, yes,” razumikhin said hurriedly, for some reason agreeing with everything. “so that’s why you . . . were so surprised then. . . . you know, in your delirium you kept mentioning some rings and chains! yes, yes. . . . it’s clear, now it’s all clear.” “so that’s it! that’s how far this idea has gotten! this man would agree to be crucified for me, and he’s very glad that things have all cleared up, because i mentioned rings in my delirium! that just confirmed what they were all thinking!” “will we find him at home?” he asked aloud. “we will, we will,” razumikhin hastened to say. “he’s a fine fellow, my friend, you’ll see! he’s a bit awkward; that is, he’s a worldly man, but in another sense, i say he’s awkward. he’s a clever fellow, clever, even very smart, only he has a special cast of mind. . . . he’s mistrustful, a skeptic, a cynic. . . . he loves to dupe people, that is, not dupe them, but fool them. . . . the old-style, physical method. . . . he knows his business, he does. . . . he was investigating a case of murder last year in which all the clues had been lost! he very, very, very much wants to make your acquaintance!” “why do you say ‘very much?’ ” “that is, not to . . . you see, lately, since you fell ill, i’ve frequently had the occasion to talk about you a great deal. . . . well, he listened . . . and when he learned you were studying law and that as a result of circumstances you were unable to complete the course, he said, ‘what a pity!’ so i concluded . . . that is, from all of it, not just one thing; yesterday zametov. . . . you see, rodya, i blurted out something to you yesterday when i was intoxicated, as we were going home . . . and i fear, my friend, that you exaggerated it, you see . . .” “what was that? that they think i’m mad? yes, maybe it’s true.” he gave a forced smile. “yes . . . yes . . . i mean, bah! no! well, everything i said (about other things as well), all that was nonsense and because i was drunk.” “why are you apologizing? i’m so fed up with all of it!” cried raskolnikov with exaggerated irritation. however, he was in part pretending. “i know, i know, i understand. you can be sure i understand. i’m ashamed even to mention it.” “if you’re ashamed, then don’t talk about it!” they were both silent. razumikhin was more than in ecstasy, and raskolnikov perceived this with disgust. it also disturbed him what razumikhin had just said about porfiry. “i’ll have to play him for sympathy,” * he thought, turning pale, his heart pounding, “and do it as naturally as i can. the most natural thing would be not to play him at all. to say nothing at all about that! no, to refrain would also be unnatural. . . . well, we’ll see how it turns out there . . . right away . . . am i going there for good or for ill? the moth flies right into the flame. my heart’s pounding, and that’s not so good!” “in"
dostoevsky,"this gray house,” said razumikhin. “the most important thing is whether or not porfiry knows that yesterday i was in that old crone’s apartment . . . and that i asked about the blood? i have to find that out right away, from the moment i enter, to tell by his face; o-ther-wise . . . i’ll find out, no matter what!” “do you know what?” he said, turning suddenly to razumikhin with a cunning smile. “today i’ve noticed, my friend, that since morning you’ve been in an unusually excited state. is it true?” “what sort of excitement? i’m not excited at all,” razumikhin said, wincing. “no, my friend, it’s true, i noticed it. before you were sitting on that chair as you’ve never sat before, somehow on the edge of it, shuddering from a spasm. you kept jumping up for no reason at all. either you were angry, or else your mug became sweet as sugar. you even blushed; especially when they invited you to dinner, you blushed deeply.” “not at all! you’re lying! why are you saying that?” “why are you wriggling like a schoolboy? phew, the devil take him. he’s blushed again!” “what a swine you are!” “why are you so embarrassed? you romeo! wait a moment, i’ll repeat all this today, ha, ha, ha! it’ll amuse my mama . . . and someone else, as well . . .” “listen, listen, listen, this is serious, why it’s. . . . what’s next, damn it?” razumikhin said, completely flustered and growing cold in terror. “what will you tell them? my friend, i. . . . phew! what a swine you are!” “like a rose in springtime! it suits you, if you only knew: a romeo who’s six feet tall! and you’ve washed extra carefully today, and trimmed your nails, haven’t you? when did you ever do that? so help me god, you even put pomade on your hair! bend over!” “swine!!!” raskolnikov was laughing so hard that it seemed he could scarcely restrain himself, so they entered porfiry petrovich’s apartment with laughter. that was just what raskolnikov wanted: from inside his rooms they could be heard laughing, still guffawing in the entrance. “not a word here, or i’ll . . . smash your skull!” whispered razumikhin in a fury, seizing hold of raskolnikov’s shoulder. * the original says “to sing like lazarus,” a reference to luke :. it is linked with other references to lazarus in the novel. oceanofpdf.com v r askolnikov was already entering the apartment. he went in looking as if he was trying with all his might to restrain himself from bursting into laughter again. following him, with a completely disconcerted and ferocious expression, as red as a peony, lanky and clumsy, came the embarrassed razumikhin. his face and entire figure were at that moment really ridiculous and justified raskolnikov’s laughter. raskolnikov, who had not yet been introduced, bowed to the host, who was standing in the middle of the room, looking at them inquisitively. raskolnikov extended his hand and shook his host’s, still apparently with extreme effort to suppress his good cheer and to utter at least two or three words to introduce himself. but as soon as he had managed to assume a serious expression and mutter something—suddenly, as if against his will, he looked at razumikhin again and couldn’t restrain himself: his suppressed laughter broke out again, all the more uncontrollably the more he tried to control himself. the extraordinary ferocity with which razumikhin reacted to this “genuine” laughter lent this scene the appearance of the most sincere merriment and, most importantly, naturalness. razumikhin, as if on purpose, contributed to this effect. “damn it all!” he roared, waving his arm and crashing into a small round table holding an almost empty glass of tea. everything went flying and splintering. “ ‘of course, alexander the great was a great hero, but why break the chairs, gentlemen? * you’re destroying government property!’ ” cried porfiry petrovich cheerfully. the scene was as follows: raskolnikov, forgetting that the host was shaking his hand, was still laughing heartily; but having a sense of proportion, he was waiting for an opportunity to end his outburst as soon as possible in the most natural way. razumikhin, positively embarrassed from having knocked over the table and broken the glass, regarded the fragments grimly, spit, and turned abruptly to the window and stood with his back to the others, his face wearing a terrible frown, looking out the window, but seeing nothing. porfiry petrovich was laughing and wished to be laughing, but it was obvious that he needed some sort of explanation. zametov had been seated on a chair in the corner. he’d stood up at the guests’ arrival and was standing there waiting, his mouth wide open in a smile, but regarding the whole scene in bewilderment and even disbelief; he looked at raskolnikov with some confusion. zametov’s unexpected presence struck raskolnikov unpleasantly. “i’ll have to take that into consideration,” he thought. “excuse us, please,” he began with forced embarrassment. “for goodness’ sake, it’s a pleasure to meet you, and you entered so pleasantly, too. . . . so then, doesn’t he even want to say hello to me?” porfiry petrovich asked, glancing at razumikhin. “so help me god, i don’t know why he’s so angry with me. all i said to him along the way was that he resembled romeo, and . . . i proved it. that’s all there was to it.” “swine!” razumikhin blurted out without turning around. “he must have had very serious reasons for getting so angry with you for saying that one little word,” said porfiry with a laugh. “oh, you! that’s the detective speaking! well, the hell with all of you!” razumikhin cried. all of a sudden, now with a cheerful face, he burst into laughter himself, as if nothing had happened, and went up to porfiry petrovich. “that’ll do! we’re all fools. let’s get down to business. this is my friend"
dostoevsky,"rodion romanych raskolnikov. in the first place, you’ve heard about him before and wished to make his acquaintance; in the second place, he has a small matter to discuss with you. bah! zametov! why are you here? you know each other, don’t you? since when?” “what’s this all about?” wondered raskolnikov apprehensively. zametov seemed a little confused, but not overly so. “we met yesterday at your place,” he said casually. “that means god spared us the trouble: last week he was constantly asking me to introduce him to you, porfiry, but i see that you’ve already sniffed each other out without me. . . . by the way, where’s your snuff?” porfiry petrovich was dressed informally, in a dressing gown, extremely clean linen, and well-worn slippers. he was about thirty-five years old, shorter than average, portly, even with a paunch; he was clean-shaven, without a mustache or side whiskers, with closely cropped hair on his large round head, which bulged somewhat prominently at the rear. his puffy, round, somewhat snub-nosed face had a sickly, dark yellow pallor, but his expression was rather brazen and even sarcastic. it could even have been friendly had it not been for the look of his eyes, with their watery, liquid gleam, almost covered by white eyelashes, twitching as if he were winking at someone. the expression of his eyes, somewhat strangely, didn’t match his whole figure, which had something womanish about it, and lent it something far more serious than one might expect at first sight. as soon as he heard that his guest had a “small matter” to discuss with him, porfiry petrovich immediately asked him to sit down on the sofa. he himself sat at the other end of it and looked intently at his guest with the eager anticipation of hearing an explanation of the business, with exaggerated and overly serious attention, which can be oppressive and even confusing at first, especially for strangers, especially if what you are stating, in your own opinion, is out of proportion to the amount of unusually serious attention it receives. but in short and coherent terms, raskolnikov clearly and accurately explained his business and was satisfied that he had even managed to take a good look at porfiry. not once did porfiry petrovich take his eyes off him all during that time. razumikhin, who had taken the opposite seat at the same table, followed the explanation of the matter eagerly and impatiently, constantly glancing from one to the other and back again, which began to seem a bit excessive. “fool!” raskolnikov silently cursed him. “you should make a statement to the police,” porfiry replied with the same businesslike expression, “to the effect that, having learned about such and such an occurrence, that is, about the murder, you request, in turn, to inform the examining magistrate who was delegated to this case that such and such items belong to you and that you wish to redeem them . . . or something of the sort—however, they’ll write it for you.” “that’s just the point: at the present time, i . . .” raskolnikov tried to appear as embarrassed as he could. “i lack the funds . . . and can’t even manage such a small expenditure. . . . you see, now i’d merely like to declare that these items are mine, and when i have the funds, then i’ll . . .” “that doesn’t matter, sir,” replied porfiry petrovich, receiving this explanation of raskolnikov’s finances coldly. “however, if you like, you can write directly to me in the same vein, that having learned of this occurrence, and declaring such and such items, you request that . . .” “do i just write it on plain paper?” raskolnikov hastened to interrupt, once again taking an interest in the financial side of the matter. “oh, the most ordinary paper will do, sir!” porfiry petrovich said suddenly, and regarded him with apparent mockery, squinting and seeming to wink at him. however, perhaps it only seemed that way to raskolnikov, because it lasted for only a moment. at least, something of the sort occurred. raskolnikov could have sworn that he had winked at him, only the devil knew why. “he knows!” flashed through his mind like a streak of lightning. “excuse me for bothering you with such nonsense,” he continued, a bit disconcerted. “my items are worth only about five rubles, but they’re especially dear to me as keepsakes of those from whom i received them, and i confess, as soon as i learned about it, i was very frightened that . . .” “that’s why you became so upset yesterday when i told zosimov that porfiry was questioning the people who had pledges!” razumikhin inserted with obvious intention. this was unbearable. raskolnikov couldn’t refrain and cast him a vicious glance of rage with his flashing dark eyes. then he recovered immediately. “my friend, you seem to be making fun of me,” he said, turning to him with cleverly contrived irritation. “i agree that perhaps in your eyes i’m overly concerned about these trifles; but you can’t consider me an egoist or a greedy man. in my own view, these two little insignificant things are not trifles at all. i just told you that the silver watch, which is worth very little, is the only object left from my father. you may laugh at me, but my mother’s come to visit”—he turned to porfiry suddenly—“and if she finds out,” he said, quickly turning back to razumikhin, trying hard to make his voice tremble, “that this watch has been lost, then i swear, she’ll be in despair! women!” “not at all! i didn’t mean that at all! just the opposite!” cried the offended razumikhin. “was that all right? was it natural? too exaggerated?” raskolnikov wondered anxiously. “why did i say, ‘women’?” “has your mother come to see you?” porfiry petrovich inquired for some reason. “yes.” “when was that, sir?” “last evening.” porfiry was silent, as if pondering. “in any"
dostoevsky,"case, your items couldn’t possibly be lost,” he continued calmly and coldly. “i’ve been waiting for you here for some time.” as if nothing unusual had occurred, he kindly offered an ashtray to razumikhin, who was mercilessly scattering ashes on the rug. raskolnikov shuddered, but porfiry seemed not to notice him, all the while concerned only about razumikhin’s cigarette. “what? been waiting here! so did you know that he, too, had left pledges there ?” cried razumikhin. porfiry petrovich addressed raskolnikov directly: “your two items, the ring and the watch, were in her room wrapped together in one piece of paper, on which your name was clearly written in pencil, as well as the day of the month when she had received them from you . . .” “how is it you’re so observant?” raskolnikov asked clumsily, trying hard to look him in the eye; but he was unable to endure it and suddenly added, “i asked only because there were probably many people who’d pawned things . . . so it must have been difficult for you to recall them all. . . . yet, on the contrary, you remember them all clearly and . . . and . . .” “stupid! weak! why did i add that?” “almost all of them have been identified, and you were the only one who’d yet to come forward,” replied porfiry with a barely noticeable shade of mockery. “i wasn’t quite well.” “i heard about that, sir. i even heard that you were very disturbed about something or other. even now you look a bit pale.” “not at all . . . on the contrary, i’m completely well!” raskolnikov replied rudely and angrily, suddenly changing his tone. malice was seething in him, and he was unable to suppress it. “if i speak in anger, i’ll give myself away!” occurred to him again. “why are they tormenting me?” “he wasn’t quite well!” razumikhin interjected. “what nonsense he’s talking. until yesterday he was constantly delirious. . . . well, just think, porfiry, he could barely stand on his feet, but as soon as we, that is zosimov and i, let him out of our sight yesterday—he got dressed, slipped out, and was up to some mischief almost until midnight, and all this in his total delirium, i tell you. can you imagine that? a most extraordinary episode!” “really in total delirium ? you don’t say!” porfiry said, shaking his head with some kind of effeminate gesture. “hey, that’s nonsense! don’t believe it! but you don’t believe him anyway,” raskolnikov blurted out with too much anger. porfiry petrovich, however, seemed not to have heard these strange words. “how could you have gone out unless you were delirious?” razumikhin asked suddenly, growing heated. “why did you go out? for what? and why in secret? were you in your right mind then? now that all the danger’s passed, i’m saying this directly to you!” “i was fed up with all of them yesterday,” raskolnikov replied, turning suddenly to porfiry with an arrogantly challenging smile. “i ran away from them to rent an apartment so they wouldn’t be able to find me; i grabbed a pile of money to take with me. mr. zametov here even saw the money. so, mr. zametov, was i in my right mind yesterday or delirious? settle this quarrel.” at that moment, he would have liked to strangle zametov. he didn’t appreciate his look or his silence at all. “in my opinion, you spoke extremely rationally and even cleverly, sir, but you were too irritable,” zametov declared drily. “but today nikodim fomich told me,” porfiry petrovich inserted, “that he met you yesterday, very late, in the apartment of a certain civil servant who’d been run over by horses . . .” “what about that civil servant?” razumikhin chimed in. “well, weren’t you insane at his apartment? you gave the widow your last rubles for the funeral! so, if you wanted to help—give her fifteen or twenty, but leave yourself at least three rubles. but you handed over all twenty-five!” “perhaps i found a treasure somewhere—how do you know? i was feeling very generous yesterday. . . . mr. zametov knows i found a treasure! excuse me, please,” he said, turning to porfiry with trembling lips, “for disturbing you with such trivial nonsense for the last half hour. you must be sick of us, right?” “not at all, sir, quite to the contrary, to the con-tra-ry! if you only knew how you intrigue me! it’s interesting to see and hear . . . and i, i must confess, i’m so glad that you finally decided to come . . .” “give me some tea at least! my throat’s dry!” cried razumikhin. “a splendid idea! perhaps everyone will join you. would you like something . . . more substantial before we have tea?” “go ahead!” said razumikhin. porfiry petrovich went to order the tea. thoughts were spinning like a whirlwind in raskolnikov’s head. he was terribly irritated. “the main thing is they don’t want to conceal it or stand on ceremony! and if you didn’t know me, how was it you talked to nikodim fomich about me? it must mean that they don’t even want to hide the fact that they’re following me like a pack of dogs. they spit in my face quite openly!” he trembled with rage. “well, go on and beat me, but don’t play with me like a cat with a mouse. it’s not polite, porfiry petrovich; perhaps i won’t allow it, sir! i’ll stand up and blurt out the whole truth right in everyone’s ugly mug; you’ll see how i despise you!” he caught his breath with difficulty. “but what if it only seems so to me? what if it’s a mirage, and i’m mistaken about everything, furious out of inexperience, unable to keep acting this vile part? perhaps it’s all unintentional. their words are all so ordinary, but there’s something to them. . . . one can always say"
dostoevsky,"that, but there’s something to it. why did he say ‘in her room’? why did zametov add that i spoke ‘cleverly?’ why do they use that tone of voice? yes . . . that tone. . . . razumikhin was sitting here, too; why didn’t it occur to him? nothing ever occurs to that innocent blockhead! it’s the fever again! did porfiry wink at me just now or not? do they want to irritate my nerves or tease me? is it all a mirage, or do they know ? even zametov’s impertinent. . . . is he? zametov reconsidered overnight. i had a feeling he’d reconsider! he feels at home here, yet he’s here for the first time. porfiry doesn’t treat him as a guest and is sitting with his back to him. they came to terms because of me ! they were definitely talking about me before we arrived! do they know i went back to the apartment? i wish they’d get on with it! when i said yesterday i’d gone off to rent an apartment, he missed it, didn’t catch it. . . . but it was clever of me to bring up the idea of the apartment: it’ll be useful later on! delirious, they say! ha, ha, ha! he knows all about last evening! but he didn’t know that my mother had come! and that old crone wrote down the date in pencil! you’re lying, i won’t let you catch me! they still don’t have any facts; it’s only a mirage! no, give me facts! the apartment’s no fact, but delirium; i know what to say to them. . . . do they know i went back to the apartment? i won’t leave until i find out! why did i come here? but now i’m getting angry, and that just might be a fact! phew, i’m so irritable! perhaps that’s all right; it’s the role of a sick man. . . . he’s feeling me out. he’ll try to sidetrack me. why did i come?” all this flashed through his head like lightning. porfiry petrovich returned in a moment. he suddenly seemed more cheerful. “you know, brother, since your party yesterday, my head’s . . . i’ve become so muddled,” he said to razumikhin in a completely different tone of voice, laughing. “well, was it interesting? i deserted you yesterday at the most interesting point. who won?” “no one, naturally. we moved on to discuss eternal questions and wound up with our heads in the sky.” “just imagine, rodya, what they were going on about yesterday: is there such a thing as crime or not? i told you they were telling tall tales!” “what’s so surprising? it’s an ordinary social question,” raskolnikov observed distractedly. “the question wasn’t formulated that way,” remarked porfiry. “not quite, that’s true,” agreed razumikhin at once, hastening and getting excited as usual. “you see, rodion: listen and give us your opinion. i’d like to hear it. i did my utmost with them yesterday and was waiting for you; i even told them about you and said you’d come. . . . it all began with the views of the socialists. their points are well known: crime is a protest against the abnormal structure of society—and that’s that, nothing else; no further reasons are permitted—nothing more!” “that’s not true!” cried porfiry petrovich. he grew visibly more animated and kept laughing, looking at razumikhin, which excited the latter even more. “nothing else is permitted!” razumikhin interrupted with passion. “i’m telling the truth! i’ll show you their books: they say it’s all because ‘the environment has ruined them’—and nothing else! it’s their favorite phrase! from there it follows that if society were to be organized normally, then all crimes would disappear instantly, since there’d be no reason to protest and everyone would immediately become righteous. nature isn’t taken into account; nature’s banished; nature’s not allowed! according to them, it’s not humanity, developing historically along a living path to the end, which in and of itself turns into a normal society, but, on the contrary, the social system, emerging from some mathematical brain, that immediately organizes all humanity and in one moment renders it righteous and sinless, before any living progress, without any historical and living path! that’s why they instinctively don’t like history: they see only its ‘outrages and stupidity’—and everything’s explained only by stupidity! that’s why they don’t like the living process of life itself: they don’t need a living soul ! the living soul demands life; the living soul doesn’t heed the laws of mechanics; the living soul is suspect; the living soul is reactionary! even if their social system can be made out of rubber and smells a bit like carrion—it’s still not alive, it has no will, it’s slavish, it doesn’t rebel! and the result is that all their labor goes only to laying bricks and arranging the corridors and rooms in a phalanstery. † the phalanstery’s built, but human nature still isn’t ready for the phalanstery; it wants life; it still hasn’t completed the living process; it’s too early for the cemetery! it’s impossible to leap over human nature by means of logic alone! logic can anticipate three possibilities, but there are a million of them! cut off the whole million and reduce everything to a question of comfort! that’s the simplest solution to the problem! it’s clearly tempting and one doesn’t have to think! the main point is—there’s no need to think! the entire secret of life fits on two sheets of printer’s paper!” “there’s some outburst for you; he’s beating his drum! he needs to be restrained,” said porfiry with a laugh. “just imagine,” he said, turning to raskolnikov, “that’s the way it was last evening. six voices in one room and he’d plied them all with punch beforehand—can you imagine it? no, brother, you’re not telling the truth: the ‘environment’ plays a large role in crime, i can assure you.” “i know that it does, but tell me"
dostoevsky,"this: a forty-year-old man disgraces a ten-year-old girl—did the environment compel him to do it?” “well, strictly speaking, perhaps it was the environment,” porfiry remarked with astonishing seriousness. “a crime against a young girl can very, very often be explained by the ‘environment.’ ” razumikhin was absolutely furious. “well, if you like, i’ll prove to you at once,” he roared, “that you have white eyelashes only as a result of the fact that ivan the great’s bell tower is two hundred and fifty feet tall, and i’ll prove it clearly, precisely, progressively, and even with a liberal cast. i’ll do it! do you want to bet?” “i take the bet! please let’s hear how he proves it!” “damn it all, he’s pretending!” cried razumikhin, jumping up and waving his arm. “is it even worth talking with you? he’s doing all this on purpose, rodion. you still don’t know him! yesterday he took their side only to show them up as fools. what didn’t he say yesterday, good lord! and they were so pleased with him! he can hold out like this for two weeks. last year he assured us for some reason that he was going to become a monk: for two months he insisted on it! not long ago he tried to convince us that he was getting married and was all ready for the ceremony. he’d even acquired new clothes for the occasion. we started to congratulate him. but there was no bride, nothing ever happened—it was all a mirage!” “you’re not telling the truth! i’d acquired new clothes before that. it was because of my new clothes that i decided to fool you all.” “are you really such a dissembler?” raskolnikov asked casually. “don’t you think so? just wait and i’ll deceive you, too—ha, ha, ha! no, don’t you see, i’ll tell you the whole truth. regarding all these questions, crimes, environments, and young girls—i now remember—however, it’s always interested me—your little article ‘on crime’ . . . or whatever it’s called, i forgot the title, i can’t recall it. two months ago i had the pleasure of reading it in periodical discourses. ” “my article? in periodical discourses ?” raskolnikov asked in surprise. “i did write an article in connection with some book about six months ago, when i left the university, but i sent it to weekly discourses , not periodical discourses. ” “it wound up in periodical discourses .” “ weekly discourses ceased publication, which is why it wasn’t published there . . .” “that’s true, sir; when it ceased publication, weekly discourses merged with periodical discourses , and therefore your little article appeared in periodical discourses two months ago. didn’t you know?” raskolnikov really didn’t know a thing about it. “good gracious, you can request money from them for your article! but what a temperament you have! you live such an isolated life that you don’t even know things that concern you directly. that’s a fact, sir.” “bravo, rodka! i didn’t know it, either!” cried razumikhin. “i’ll run to the reading room today and ask for that issue! two months ago? what date? i’ll find it somehow. that’s quite something! and he didn’t even tell me!” “how did you know that it was my article? i signed it only with my initials.” “i found out accidentally and only a few days ago. from the editor; he’s an acquaintance. . . . i was very interested in it.” “i was examining, if i recall, the psychological state of the criminal during the entire commission of his crime.” “yes, sir, and you insisted that the act of committing a crime is always accompanied by illness. it’s very, very original, but . . . it wasn’t that part of your little piece that caught my eye; rather, it was the idea mentioned at the end of the article, which, unfortunately, you merely touch on by implication, that there exist in the world certain people, as it were, who are able . . . that is, not that they’re able, but who have every right to commit any kind of outrages and crimes, and that the laws do not apply to them.” raskolnikov smiled at the forced and intentional distortion of his idea. “what? what’s that? a right to crime? and not because ‘the environment ruined them’?” razumikhin inquired with some alarm. “no, no, that’s not exactly why,” replied porfiry. “the point is that in his article all people are divided into ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary.’ ordinary people must live in obedience and do not have the right to overstep the law, because, don’t you see, they’re ordinary. but extraordinary people have the right to commit all sorts of crimes and to overstep precisely because they’re extraordinary. that’s what you say, it seems, if i’m not mistaken?” “how’s that? it can’t be like that!” razumikhin muttered in confusion. raskolnikov smiled again. he understood immediately what the point was and where he was being pushed; he remembered his article. he decided to accept the challenge. “that’s not exactly what i said,” he began simply and modestly. “however, i confess that you stated it almost correctly, even, if you like, completely correctly. . . .” (he found it very pleasant to agree that it was completely correct.) “the only difference is that i don’t insist in any way that extraordinary people absolutely must and are always obligated to commit all sorts of outrages, as you say. it even seems to me that such an article wouldn’t be accepted for publication. i merely imply that the ‘extraordinary man’ has the right . . . that is, not the official right, but he himself has the right to permit his conscience to overstep . . . various obstacles, and only in the case that the execution of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, one that would benefit all mankind) requires it. you say that my article was unclear; i’m prepared to explain it to you, as best i can. perhaps i’m not mistaken in"
dostoevsky,"assuming that you’d like me to; if you please, sir. in my opinion, if the discoveries of kepler and newton could in no way have become known to people other than through the sacrifice of the lives of one, ten, a hundred, and so on, people who interfered with their discoveries or who were obstacles blocking their way, then newton had the right, and was even obligated to . . . eliminate those ten or a hundred people in order to make his discoveries known to all humanity. from this it in no way follows that newton had the right to kill anyone and everyone he pleased, or to rob people every day at the market. furthermore, i recall, i develop the idea in my article, that all people . . . at least the lawgivers and trailblazers of humanity, beginning with the ancients, continuing with lycurgus, the solons, mohammeds, napoleons, and so forth, each and every one of them, were criminals, just by virtue of the fact that in propagating new laws, they were at the same time destroying the old laws viewed as sacred by society and handed down by their fathers. of course, they didn’t hesitate even to shed blood, if that blood (sometimes completely innocent and valiantly shed in defense of the old laws) would help them. it’s even noteworthy that a majority of these benefactors and trailblazers of humanity were particularly horrible shedders of blood. in a word, i conclude that everyone, not only the great people, but even those who stand out just slightly from the everyday rut, that is, those who are even marginally capable of uttering some new word, must, by their nature, necessarily be criminals—more or less, it goes without saying. otherwise it would be difficult for them to break out of the rut, and, of course, they can’t agree to remain in the rut, again, by their very nature; but in my opinion, they’re even obligated not to agree to stay there. in a word, you see that up to this point there’s nothing particularly new in what i say. this has all been written and read a thousand times. regarding my division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, i agree that it’s somewhat arbitrary, but i’m not insisting on exact numbers. i merely believe in my main idea. it consists precisely in the view that by the laws of nature, people are divided in general into two categories: the lower category (ordinary), that is, so to speak, material serving solely for the purpose of reproducing the species, and into people proper, that is, those who possess the gift or talent of uttering some new word in their milieu. subdivisions here are naturally endless, but the notable characteristics of both categories are rather distinct: the first category, that is, the material, speaking in general, consists of conservative people by nature, well-behaved, who live in obedience and like being obedient. in my opinion, they’re even obligated to be obedient because that’s their destiny, and there’s nothing humiliating about it for them. the second category consists of people who break the law, destroyers or, judging by their abilities, those predisposed to be so. their crimes, it goes without saying, are relative and diverse; for the most part, in extremely diverse forms they require the destruction of the present order in the name of something better. but even if it’s necessary to step over a corpse, to wade through blood in order to attain his goal, then in my opinion he may, according to his conscience, give himself permission to wade through blood, depending, however, on the nature of his idea and its dimensions—note that well. only in that sense do i speak in my article about their right to commit a crime. (you’ll recall that we began with the legal question.) however, there’s no cause for alarm: the mass of humanity hardly ever recognizes this right; it punishes these men or hangs them (more or less), and does so with absolute justification, fulfilling its conservative function, although in succeeding generations this same mass of humanity places those very same people who were executed on a pedestal and worships them (more or less). the first category always comprises men of the present; the second, men of the future. the former preserve the world and increase its population; the latter move the world forward and lead it to its goal. both have an equal right to exist. in a word, all men have equally strong rights, and— vive la guerre éternelle ‡ —until the new jerusalem, of course!” “so, you still believe in the new jerusalem?” “i do,” raskolnikov replied firmly; while saying this he stared down at the ground, as he had done during the entire course of his long tirade, having selected a spot on the rug. “an-n-n-nd do you believe in god? forgive me for being so curious.” “i do,” repeated raskolnikov, raising his eyes to porfiry’s face. “an-n-nd do you believe in the raising of lazarus?” “i-i do. why are you asking these questions?” “do you believe in it literally?” “literally.” “i see, sir . . . i was merely curious. forgive me, sir. but, if you please, i’ll return to the previous subject. they aren’t always executed. some, on the contrary . . .” “triumph during their lifetime? oh, yes, some attain their goals in their lifetime, and then . . . “then they begin executing other people?” “if necessary, you know, and even the large majority of them do it. in general, your remark is very witty.” “thank you, sir. but tell me this: how does one distinguish the extraordinary people from the ordinary ones? are there some special signs at birth? i have in mind that greater accuracy is needed, so to speak, more external distinctness. excuse the natural discomfort of a practical and well-intentioned man, but might it be possible to arrange for them to wear special clothing or to bear some mark? because, you’ll agree,"
dostoevsky,"if some confusion results and one of the ordinary category imagines that he belongs to the other one, and begins to ‘eliminate all obstacles,’ as you expressed it so fortuitously, well then . . .” “oh, this happens very often! this observation of yours is even wittier than your last one.” “thank you, sir.” “don’t mention it, sir. but consider the fact that a mistake is possible only on the part of those people in the first category, that is, the ‘ordinary’ people (as i called them, perhaps very inauspiciously). in spite of their inborn inclination to obey, by a certain playfulness of nature, not denied even to a cow, an extremely large number of them like to imagine themselves advanced people, ‘destroyers,’ and they aspire to utter a ‘new word.’ they do this with absolute sincerity. as a matter of fact, at the same time they very often fail to notice the genuinely ‘new people,’ § and even despise them as backward and incapable of higher thinking. but, in my opinion, there can be no real danger here, and you have nothing to worry about, because these people never get very far. of course, they can sometimes be beaten for their fervor, so as to remind them of their rightful place, but nothing more. you don’t even need anyone to carry out the punishment: they’ll beat themselves up because they’re so well behaved. some will provide this service to others, and some will do it to themselves. . . . they impose various public punishments on themselves—and it turns out beautifully and instructively. in a word, you have no need to worry. . . . this is the law.” “well, at least on that score you’ve somewhat reassured me. but here’s another concern, sir: tell me, please, are there many of these people, the ‘extraordinary’ ones, who have the right to mow down others? of course, i’m prepared to bow down before them, but you’ll agree, it would be terrible if there were very many of them, wouldn’t it?” “oh, don’t worry about that, either,” raskolnikov continued in the same tone. “in general, an unusually small number of people are born, even strangely few, with a new idea, or who are capable of even uttering something new . only one thing is clear: the order that controls the human births, all these categories and subdivisions, must be extremely closely and accurately determined by some law of nature. this law, it goes without saying, is now unknown, but i believe that it exists and may subsequently become known. the enormous mass of people, the material, exists on earth merely, at last, through some effort, some as yet mysterious process, by means of some crossing of generations and breeds, to exert all its strength, and at last to bring into the world at least one person out of a thousand who’s in any way original. perhaps one in ten thousand (i’m speaking approximately, by way of illustration) is born with even broader originality. with even more—one out of a hundred thousand. men of genius—out of millions, and great geniuses, the culmination of humanity—perhaps only as a result of the passing of many thousands of millions of people across the earth. in a word, i haven’t looked into the glass retort in which all this happens. but there absolutely is a definite law and there must be one; it can’t all be a matter of chance.” “are you both joking, or what?” razumikhin exclaimed at last. “you’re trying to mislead each other, aren’t you? you just sit there mocking one another! can you be serious, rodya?” raskolnikov turned his pale, almost sad face to him and made no reply. porfiry’s ostensible, insistent, irritating, and impolite sarcasm seemed strange to razumikhin when compared to his friend’s calm, sad face. “well, my friend, if this really is so serious, then. . . . of course, you’re right that none of it’s new and it all resembles everything we’ve read and heard a thousand times before. but what’s really original in all this—and belongs exclusively to you, to my chagrin—is the fact that you sanction bloodshed as a matter of conscience and, excuse me for saying so, even with such fanaticism. . . . that, accordingly, is the main idea of your article. the sanctioning of bloodshed as a matter of conscience; why, in my opinion, that’s more terrible than an official or legal sanction to shed blood . . .” “absolutely right, it is more terrible,” echoed porfiry. “no, you must’ve gotten carried away somehow! it’s all a mistake. i’ll read it. . . . you were carried away! you can’t really think that. . . . i’ll read it.” “you won’t find all that in my article; it’s only hinted at there,” raskolnikov said. “yes, indeed,” said porfiry, unable to sit still. “now it’s almost clear to me how you regard crime, but . . . you must excuse my persistence (i’m really sorry to bother you like this), but don’t you see: you’ve managed to reassure me now about my mistake, confusing your two categories, but . . . it’s the various practical cases i still find troubling! just suppose some person or other, let’s say, a young man, imagines that he’s a spartan lawgiver like lycurgus or a prophet like mohammed—a future one, understandably—and let’s say that he decides to remove all obstacles blocking his way. . . . ‘a long campaign lies ahead of me,’ he thinks, ‘and i need money to undertake it.’ and he starts to amass what he needs for his campaign. . . . you understand?” zametov, from the corner where he was sitting, suddenly snorted. raskolnikov didn’t even raise his eyes to look at him. “i must agree,” raskolnikov replied calmly, “that such cases really must exist. stupid and vain men in particular will swallow the bait, our young people especially.” “so you do see. well, what then?” “what then?” raskolnikov smiled. “i’m not to"
dostoevsky,"blame for it. that’s the way it is and always will be. just now he said”—nodding at razumikhin—“that i sanction bloodshed. so what? society is well provided for with all its exiles, prisons, examining magistrates, and hard labor—what’s there to worry about? go look for your thief!” “well, and if we find him?” “then he gets what he deserves.” “you’re so logical. and what about his conscience?” “what business is that of yours?” “just so, out of human kindness.” “if someone has a conscience, and if he acknowledges his mistake, then let him suffer. that’s his punishment, in addition to hard labor.” “and the real geniuses,” razumikhin asked with a frown, “those granted the right to kill, shouldn’t they have to suffer at all, even for the blood they shed?” “why use the word ‘should’? this doesn’t involve a question of permission or prohibition. let him suffer, if he pities the victim. . . . pain and suffering are always obligatory for someone with broad intellect and deep feeling. truly great individuals, it seems to me, must experience great sorrow in this world,” he added, suddenly becoming contemplative, and no longer in a conversational mode. he raised his eyes, regarded everyone somberly, smiled, and picked up his cap. now he was much calmer than when he’d first arrived, and he felt this. everyone stood up. “well, then, scold me or not, get angry with me or not, but i can’t hold back,” porfiry petrovich declared again. “allow me to pose one more small question (i’m still troubling you, i know); i want to introduce one tiny little idea of mine, merely so as not to forget it . . .” “all right, what’s your little idea?” raskolnikov asked, serious and pale, standing in front of him in anticipation. “here it is . . . really, i don’t know how best to express it . . . this little idea of mine is so very playful . . . and psychological. . . . well then, when you were composing your little article—could it possibly be the case, heh-heh, that you might also have considered yourself, even the tiniest bit, to be an ‘extraordinary’ man uttering some new word, in the sense that you’re using it. . . . isn’t that so?” “very possibly,” raskolnikov replied contemptuously. razumikhin made a movement. “and if so, then might you yourself have decided—well, in view of some unfortunate worldly circumstances and constraints, or for the advancement of all mankind in some way—to step over those obstacles? say, for example, to kill and rob?” suddenly porfiry seemed to wink at him with his left eye again and chuckle inaudibly, just as he had before. “if i were to step over, then, of course, i wouldn’t tell you,” raskolnikov replied with arrogant, provocative contempt. “no, indeed, it’s just that i’m interested, strictly, in clarifying the meaning of your article, merely in a literary sense, of course . . .” “ugh! this is so obvious and insolent!” raskolnikov thought with disgust. “allow me to observe,” he replied drily, “that i don’t consider myself a mohammed or a napoleon . . . or anyone of that sort; therefore, not being one of them, i can’t possibly provide you with a satisfactory explanation of how i would act, if i were.” “well, come, come now, who among us in holy rus doesn’t consider himself a napoleon these days?” porfiry suddenly asked with alarming familiarity. this time there was even something unusually distinctive in his intonation. “wasn’t it just some sort of future napoleon who did in our alyona ivanovna with an axe last week?” zametov blurted out from his corner. raskolnikov was silent and stared fixedly and decisively at porfiry. razumikhin frowned sullenly. even before this moment he’d begun to be aware of something unusual. he looked around in anger. there was a minute of gloomy silence. raskolnikov turned to leave. “you’re going already?” porfiry asked politely, extending his hand with excessive courtesy. “i’m very, very glad to have made your acquaintance. as for your petition, have no worries about it. just write what i told you. best of all, drop by to see me there . . . sometime soon . . . why, even tomorrow. i’ll probably be in around eleven or so. we’ll arrange everything . . . have a nice chat. . . . as one of the last people to have been there, perhaps you might be able to tell us something,” he added with a good-natured look. “do you wish to interrogate me officially, with all the formalities?” raskolnikov asked abruptly. “why on earth? for the moment, that’s quite unnecessary. you didn’t understand me. you see, i don’t let any opportunity pass me by and . . . and i’ve already spoken with all those who pawned some item . . . i’ve taken some statements . . . and you, as the last one who. . . . by the way!” he cried, suddenly delighted for some reason. “by the way, i just remembered . . . what’s the matter with me?” he turned to razumikhin. “you know how you’ve been bending my ear about that fellow nikolashka . . . yes, i know, i know,” he said, turning to raskolnikov, “that fellow’s in the clear, but what can i do, and i had to trouble mitka, too. . . . well, here’s the thing, the main point: climbing the stairs that evening . . . forgive me, you were there sometime before eight o’clock?” “yes,” replied raskolnikov, with the unpleasant feeling at that moment that he shouldn’t have admitted it. “so, climbing those stairs sometime before eight, did you happen to notice, on the second floor, in the open apartment—do you recall—two workmen, perhaps even one of them? they were there painting; by any chance did you see them? it’s very, very important for them!” “painters? no, i didn’t see them,” raskolnikov replied slowly, as if searching his memory, at the"
dostoevsky,"same time tensing his entire being, immobilized by the torment of trying to guess where the trap lay hidden, and hoping that he wouldn’t miss anything. “no, i didn’t see them; in fact, i didn’t even notice any open apartment. . . . but on the fourth floor”—he’d now fully discovered the trap and was feeling victorious—“i recall that a civil servant was moving out of his apartment . . . opposite alyona ivanovna’s . . . i remember . . . that i clearly remember. soldiers were carrying out a sofa, and i had to press up against the wall. . . . but painters—no, i don’t recall any painters. . . . and there wasn’t any open apartment anywhere. no, there wasn’t . . .” “what are you talking about?” razumikhin cried suddenly, as if coming to his senses and now understanding what was being said. “the painters were there working on the day of the murder, but he was there three days before. what are you asking him?” “ugh! i got mixed up!” porfiry said, slapping his forehead. “devil take it, this case is too much for my poor brain!” he added, turning to raskolnikov as if apologizing. “it would’ve been important for us to know if someone had seen them that same evening before eight o’clock, in that apartment, and it just occurred to me that you might be able to tell us. . . . i got all mixed up!” “you must be more careful,” razumikhin observed gloomily. these last words were uttered in the entrance hall. porfiry petrovich escorted them to the door with utmost politeness. they both emerged onto the street feeling sullen and morose, and for a few steps didn’t exchange a word. raskolnikov took a deep breath. . . . * a quotation from nikolai gogol’s (–) comedy the government inspector (). † a community organized according to the plan of the french utopian socialist, charles fourier (–). ‡ “long live perpetual war” (french). § a reference to nikolai chernyshevsky’s (–) influential novel, what is to be done ? (). oceanofpdf.com vi “. . . i don’t believe it! i can’t believe it!” a perplexed razumikhin repeated, trying with all his might to refute raskolnikov’s conclusions. they were already nearing bakaleev’s house, where, in their rented rooms, pulkheriya aleksandrovna and dunya had been waiting for them for quite a while. razumikhin frequently paused along the way, impelled by the heat of the conversation, confused and agitated solely by the fact that it was the first time they had spoken plainly about that . “then don’t believe it!” replied raskolnikov with a cold, calm grin. “as usual, you didn’t notice anything, while i was weighing every word.” “you’re mistrustful, that’s why you weighed every word. . . . hmm. really, i agree that porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and especially that scoundrel zametov! you’re right, there was something in it—but why? why?” “he changed his mind overnight.” “on the contrary, the contrary! if they’d had that brainless idea, they’d have tried with all their might to conceal it and hide their cards so they could catch you afterward. . . . but now—it’s insolent and careless!” “if they really had any facts, that is, genuine facts, or some kind of well-founded suspicions, they’d really have tried to conceal the game, in the hope of winning even more. (but they’d have conducted a search long ago!) however, they don’t have any facts, not one—it’s all a mirage, it cuts two ways, merely a passing fancy—and they’re trying to use insolence to confuse the matter. perhaps porfiry’s angry that there are no facts and so he burst out with all that. perhaps he has some intention. . . . he seems to be a clever man. . . . maybe he wanted to frighten me by showing that he knows. . . . there’s psychology for you, my friend. . . . however, it’s horrid to have to explain all this. leave it alone!” “it’s insulting, insulting! i understand you! but . . . now, since we’ve begun talking openly (and it’s excellent that we’ve begun. i’m glad!)—now i can confess to you frankly, that i noticed this idea of theirs a while ago, all this time, it goes without saying, merely as a hint, a creeping suspicion. but why on earth should they have even a creeping suspicion? how dare they? where, where are the roots hidden? if you only knew how angry i was! what: just because you’re a poor student, disfigured by poverty and hypochondria, on the brink of a cruel illness and delirium, which might already have begun (make a note of that!), you’re mistrustful, proud, knowing your own worth, you’ve spent six months all alone seeing no one, wearing tattered clothes and boots without soles—standing in front of some policemen, tolerating their abuse; and then you’re confronted with an unexpected debt, an overdue promissory note to the court councillor chebarov, stinking paint, hundred-degree heat, stifling air, a crowd of people, an account of the murder of a person where you’d been the day before, and all this—on an empty stomach! how could you keep from fainting? and to base it all on that? on that? the hell with it! i understand how annoying it is, but in your place, rodka, i’d have burst out laughing in their faces, or better still: i’d have spat right in their ugly mugs, the thicker the better, and have landed a few dozen slaps on all of them, skillfully, as one always should, and that would be the end of it. the hell with them! take heart! what a disgrace!” “he did a good job laying it all out,” thought raskolnikov. “the hell with them? but there’s an interrogation tomorrow as well!” he said bitterly. “do i really have to explain it all to them? i’m annoyed that i humiliated myself with zametov in the tavern yesterday . . .” “the hell with"
dostoevsky,"it! i’ll go see porfiry myself! we’re related, so i’ll squeeze it out of him, let him explain the root of the matter! and as for zametov . . .” “he’s finally guessed!” thought raskolnikov. “wait!” cried razumikhin, suddenly seizing him by the shoulder. “stop! you’re wrong! i’ve just thought it through: you’re wrong! what sort of a dirty trick was it? you say the question about the workers was a dirty trick? see through it: if you’d done that, would you let it slip that you saw the workmen . . . painting the apartment? on the contrary: you wouldn’t have seen anything, even if you really had seen it! who would testify against himself?” “if i had done that deed, then i would’ve definitely said that i saw the painters and the apartment,” raskolnikov continued, stating his reply unwillingly and with apparent disgust. “but why testify against yourself?” “because only peasants and the most inexperienced novices flatly deny everything during interrogations. a person who’s somewhat intelligent and experienced tries as much as possible to admit readily to all external and inevitable facts; he merely looks for other reasons, introduces his own particular and unexpected aspect, which lends them a different significance and reveals them in a completely new light. porfiry could count on my answering like that and saying what i saw to establish credibility; then i’d bring up something to explain . . .” “but he would’ve told you immediately that the workmen couldn’t have been there two days before; consequently, you were there precisely on the day of the murder, after seven o’clock. he’d have caught you with a detail!” “that’s exactly what he was counting on, the fact that i wouldn’t have had time to think, that i’d hasten to reply more plausibly, and would forget that the workmen couldn’t have been there two days before.” “how could you forget that?” “easy as pie! clever people get tripped up most easily on just such insignificant details. the cleverer a person is, the less he suspects that he’ll be tricked by something so simple. you have to trick the cleverest person with the simplest matter. porfiry isn’t as stupid as you think at all . . .” “but after this, he’s a scoundrel!” raskolnikov couldn’t keep from laughing. but at the same moment, his own animation and the enthusiasm with which he had laid out the last explanation seemed strange to him, since he had conducted the entire previous conversation with grim disgust, apparently for his own aims and of necessity. “i’m beginning to enjoy certain aspects of this,” he thought to himself. but at almost the same time he suddenly felt strangely upset, as if an unexpected and alarming thought had struck him. his anxiety increased. they had arrived at the entrance to bakaleev’s house. “go in alone,” said raskolnikov suddenly. “i’ll be back shortly.” “where are you going? we’ve just arrived.” “i really have to. i have to do something. . . . i’ll be back in half an hour. . . . tell them.” “as you like. i’ll go with you.” “really? do you also want to torment me to death?” he cried with such bitter irritation, with such a despairing look, that razumikhin gave up. he stood on the stairs for some time and watched grimly as his friend walked off quickly in the direction of his street. at last, clenching his teeth and tightening his fists, swearing that he’d squeeze porfiry petrovich like a lemon that very day, he climbed the stairs to try to relieve pulkheriya aleksandrovna, who was already feeling anxious because of their long absence. when raskolnikov arrived at his building, his temples were damp with sweat and he was breathing heavily. he quickly climbed the stairs, entered his unlocked room, and immediately fastened the door with the hook. then in a fearful, frantic manner, he rushed to the corner, to the very same hole underneath the wallpaper where he had stashed the items, thrust in his hand, and for several minutes searched the opening carefully, examining every nook and cranny and all the folds of the wallpaper. not finding anything, he stood up and took a deep breath. as he had been approaching bakaleev’s house a while ago, he’d suddenly imagined that some item, some small chain, cuff link, or even the paper in which the items were wrapped, with the old woman’s marks on it, might somehow have slid down and gotten lost in a little crack, and then might suddenly emerge before him as unexpected and incontrovertible evidence. he stood as if lost in thought, and a strange, humble, half-vacant grin crossed his lips. at last he picked up his cap and quietly left the room. his thoughts were muddled. he was still preoccupied as he emerged from the gate. “there he is! that’s him!” cried a loud voice. he raised his head. the caretaker was standing at the door of his little room and pointing him out to a small man who looked like a tradesman, dressed in a vest and some sort of long robe, and who from a distance very much resembled a peasant woman. his head, in a soiled cap, hung down, and his entire figure seemed stooped. his flabby, wrinkled face indicated that he was over fifty; his small, swollen eyes looked grim, stern, and discontented. “what is it?” asked raskolnikov, approaching the caretaker. the tradesman squinted at him sullenly and examined him fixedly and carefully, without hurrying; then he turned away slowly and, without saying a word, walked through the gate and into the street. “what’s all this?” cried raskolnikov. “that man was asking if a student lived here; he gave your name and asked whose room you rented. then you came out, i pointed to you, and he went on his way. that’s all.” the caretaker was also a bit perplexed, but not too; he thought a little longer, turned around, and went back into his room. raskolnikov"
dostoevsky,"rushed after the tradesman and saw him right away, walking along the other side of the street at his previous steady and unhurried pace, his eyes lowered to the ground, as if thinking about something. he soon caught up with him, and for some time walked along behind him; at last he came even with him and glanced into his face from alongside. the man noticed him right away, looked at him quickly, but lowered his eyes once more. they continued walking thus for another minute, one next to the other, without exchanging a word. “you were asking the caretaker . . . about me?” raskolnikov said at last, but somehow in a low voice. the tradesman made no reply and didn’t even look up. they were silent again. “why did you . . . come and ask for me . . . and now you’re silent. . . . what’s this all about?” raskolnikov’s voice broke off, as if the words were unwilling to be uttered clearly. this time the tradesman raised his eyes and regarded raskolnikov with a sinister, gloomy look. “moiderer!” he said suddenly in a low but clear, intelligible voice. raskolnikov walked along next to him. his legs suddenly felt weak, and a chill ran up his spine; for a moment, his heart skipped a beat, but then it started pounding, as if it had come loose. they continued that way for about a hundred paces, once again in silence. the tradesman didn’t look at him. “what are you talking about? what? who’s the murderer?” muttered raskolnikov, barely audibly. “ you’re the moiderer,” he insisted, even more distinctly and commandingly, with a grin of contemptuous triumph, and once more glanced directly at raskolnikov’s pale face and into his lifeless eyes. they both approached the crossing. the tradesman turned into the street on the left and kept going without looking back. raskolnikov stood still for a long time and watched him go. he saw how the tradesman walked about fifty paces, then turned around and looked at him, remaining motionless on the same spot. it was impossible to make it out, but it seemed to raskolnikov that this time he smiled again with a cold, contemptuous, triumphant grin. with faint, weak steps, trembling knees, and a terrible chill, raskolnikov turned back and climbed the stairs to his little room. he took off his cap, put it on the table, and stood still for about ten minutes. then, feeling feeble, he lay down on the sofa and stretched out painfully with a weak groan. his eyes were closed. he lay there for half an hour. he didn’t think about anything. there were some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images, disordered and unconnected—faces of people he had seen way back in his childhood or encountered somewhere only once and couldn’t really even remember; the bell tower of the voznesensky church; the billiard table in a tavern with some officer standing next to it; the smell of cigars in a basement tobacco shop; a beer hall; a back staircase, completely dark, splattered with dirty dishwater and strewn with eggshells; and the sound of sunday church bells floating in from somewhere. . . . objects shifted and swirled, like a whirlwind. he even found some things pleasant and tried to hold on to them, but they faded. in general, something oppressed him inside, but not too much. sometimes he even felt good. . . . the slight chill hadn’t passed, but that, too, was almost pleasant to experience. he heard razumikhin’s hurried steps and his voice; he closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep. razumikhin opened the door and stood on the threshold for some time, as if in thought. then he quietly stepped into the room and cautiously approached the sofa. he could hear nastasya’s whisper: “don’t disturb him. let him have a good sleep; then he’ll have something to eat.” “indeed,” replied razumikhin. they both left quietly and closed the door. another half hour passed. raskolnikov opened his eyes and lay back again, clasping his hands behind his head. “who is he? who’s that person who emerged from under the earth? where was he, and what did he see? he saw everything, no doubt. where was he standing then and how could he see? why is he appearing only now from under the ground? how could he have seen—is it possible? hmm . . .” continued raskolnikov, growing cold and shuddering. “and the jeweler’s case that nikolai found behind the door: was that also possible? evidence? you overlook one of a million details—and there’s evidence the size of an egyptian pyramid! a fly passed by, and it saw! is this all possible?” with loathing he suddenly felt how weak he had grown, physically weak. “i should’ve known all this,” he thought with a bitter grin. “knowing myself, having had a premonition about myself, how did i dare take an axe and get stained with blood? i should have known ahead of time. . . . eh! i really did know beforehand!” he whispered in despair. “no, those people aren’t made like this; a true master, to whom all things are permitted, destroys toulon, carries out carnage in paris, forgets an army in egypt, loses half a million men in a moscow campaign, and gets away with a clever pun at vilna. and then, after his death they erect statues to him—it goes without saying that everything is permitted to him. no, clearly such men are not made of flesh and blood, but of bronze!” all of a sudden, an unexpected extraneous thought almost made him laugh: “napoleon, the pyramids, waterloo—and a scraggly, vile widow, an old woman, a moneylender, with a red trunk under her bed—what a mouthful even for porfiry petrovich to swallow! how could he do it? his sense of aesthetics would interfere: would a napoleon stoop to crawl under an ‘old woman’s’ bed? hey, what nonsense!” at times he felt that he was raving:"
dostoevsky,"he would sink into a mood of feverish excitement. “that old crone is rubbish!” he thought heatedly and impetuously. “the old woman was no more than a mistake; she wasn’t the point! the old woman was merely an illness. . . . i wanted to hurry up and overstep. . . . i didn’t kill a person, i killed a principle! a principle is what i killed, but i didn’t step over at all; i remained on this side. . . . the only thing i managed to do was to kill. and, it turns out, i didn’t even do that right. . . . a principle? why did that fool razumikhin abuse the socialists a while ago? they’re hardworking folk, businesslike people, contributing to the ‘common good.’ no, life’s been given to me once and it’ll never come again; i don’t want to wait for the ‘common good.’ i want to live myself, or else it’s better not to live at all. what of it? i merely didn’t want to pass a hungry mother, clutching a ruble in my pocket, while waiting for the ‘common good.’ they say, ‘i’ll carry one small brick for universal happiness and as a result i’ll feel my heart at peace.’ ha, ha! why did you leave me out? i live only once, and i also want to. . . . hey, i’m an aesthetic louse, nothing more,” he added suddenly and burst out laughing like a madman. “yes, i’m really a louse,” he continued, clinging to his thought with malice, burrowing into it, playing with it, enjoying it. “if only because in the first place, i’m now thinking about the fact that i’m a louse; secondly, for a whole month i’ve been pestering most gracious providence, summoning it as a witness that i’m undertaking this not for my own sake and whims, i said, but because i have a majestic and worthwhile goal. ha, ha! and, in the third place, because i proposed to observe all possible fairness in the execution, weights and measures, and arithmetic: out of all the lice on earth, i picked the least useful and, after killing her, proposed to take from her exactly as much as i needed for the first step, no more, no less (and the remainder, it goes without saying, would go to a monastery, according to the terms of her will—ha, ha!). . . . therefore, therefore, ultimately i’m a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “because i myself, perhaps, am even viler and filthier than that murdered louse, and i had a premonition earlier that i’d say that to myself after i killed her! can anything compare with such horror? oh, the vulgarity! the baseness! oh, how i understand the ‘prophet’ with a scimitar on a steed. allah commands, and ‘trembling’ creatures obey! the prophet was correct, completely correct, when he placed a won-der-ful artillery battery across a street somewhere and mowed down the innocent and the guilty, without deigning to explain himself! obey, trembling creature, and do not desire, because that’s not your business! oh, never, never will i forgive that old woman!” his hair was soaked with perspiration, his trembling lips were parched, his motionless gaze directed at the ceiling. “my mother, my sister, how i loved them! why do i hate them now? yes, i hate them, i physically hate them. i can’t stand to have them near me. . . . a while ago i went up and kissed my mother, i remember. . . . to embrace her and think that if she knew, then . . . could i really have told her then? i’m capable of that. . . . hmm! she should be the same as i am,” he added, thinking with effort as if struggling with approaching delirium. “how, how i hate that old woman now! it seems i’d kill her again if she ever came back to life! poor lizaveta! why did she turn up there? it’s strange, however: why do i hardly think about her, as if i hadn’t killed her? lizaveta! sonya! poor, meek creatures with meek eyes. . . . dear souls! why don’t they weep? why don’t they moan? they give away everything . . . they look meekly and softly. . . . sonya, sonya! gentle sonya!” he drifted into sleep; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember how he turned up on the street. it was already late evening. twilight was growing deeper, the full moon was shining more and more brightly, but the air was somehow very stuffy. crowds of people were walking along the streets; craftsmen and workers were returning home, others were out for a stroll; the air smelled of lime, dust, and stagnant water. raskolnikov was gloomy and anxious: he remembered very well that he had left home with some intention, that he had something to do, and that he should hurry, but he had forgotten what it was. suddenly he stopped and noticed that on the other side of the street, on the sidewalk, stood a man waving to him. he crossed the street toward him, but suddenly this man turned and walked away as if nothing had happened, his head lowered, without turning around or giving any sign that he had waved. “enough of this—did he wave?” wondered raskolnikov and began following him. before going ten paces, he suddenly recognized him and became frightened; it was the former tradesman, wearing the same robe and with the same stoop. raskolnikov walked along at a distance; his heart was pounding; they headed into an alley—the tradesman still didn’t turn around. “does he know that i’m following him?” wondered raskolnikov. the tradesman went through the gate to a large house. raskolnikov approached the gate and began looking: would he glance back and beckon to him? indeed, after passing through the gateway and emerging into the courtyard, the tradesman suddenly turned around and seemed to beckon to him again. raskolnikov passed through the"
dostoevsky,"gateway, too, but the tradesman was no longer in the courtyard. he must have turned at once into the first stairway. raskolnikov rushed after him. in fact, two flights above, he heard someone’s measured, unhurried footsteps. it was strange, but this staircase seemed familiar! there was a window on the first floor; moonlight was shining through the glass mournfully and mysteriously; here’s the second floor. oh! it was the same apartment in which the painters had been working. . . . how come he hadn’t known that right away? the footsteps of the man ahead died away. “he must have stopped, or else he’s hiding somewhere.” here’s the third floor; should he go on? how quiet it was, even frightening. . . . but he walked on. the sound of his own footsteps scared and alarmed him. “good lord, it’s so dark! the tradesman must be hiding in some corner. ah!” the door to the apartment stood open onto the landing; he thought for a bit and then went in. it was very dark and deserted in the entryway; there was not a soul, as if everything had been removed. quietly, on tiptoe, he went into the living room; the entire room was brightly lit by moonlight. everything was just as it had been before: chairs, mirror, yellow sofa, and framed pictures. the huge, round copper-red moon shone directly in through the windows. “this stillness is because of the moon,” thought raskolnikov. “it must be posing a riddle now.” he stood there and waited, waited a long time; the quieter the moon, the louder his heart pounded, even beginning to hurt. stillness prevailed. all of a sudden he heard a momentary dry crackling, as if a twig had broken, and then everything became silent again. an awakened fly suddenly bumped into the windowpane and began buzzing plaintively. at that very moment in the corner, between the small wardrobe and the window, he noticed what seemed to be a cloak hanging on the wall. “why’s there a cloak here?” he wondered. “it wasn’t there before . . .” he approached it quietly and guessed that someone might be hiding behind it. he cautiously drew back the cloak with his hand and saw a chair on which the old woman sat, all huddled over, holding her head in such a way that he couldn’t see her face—but it was she. he stood over her. “she’s afraid,” he thought and quietly freed the axe from its loop and struck the old woman on the crown of her head once and then again. but it was strange: she didn’t even stir under the blows, as if she were made of wood. he grew fearful, bent over, and began looking at her more closely; she bent her head even lower. then he crouched all the way down to the floor and glanced up at her face; he took one look and froze in horror: the old woman was sitting there, laughing—she was overcome with quiet, inaudible laughter, trying with all her might to make sure he didn’t hear her. suddenly it seemed that the door to her bedroom was opening slightly and there, too, someone was laughing and whispering. rage overcame him: he began striking the old woman on the head with all his strength, but with each blow of the axe the laughter and whispering from the bedroom sounded stronger and louder, and the old woman shook with mirth. he tried to flee, but the entire entryway was filled with people, the door to the staircase was open, and on the landing, the staircase, and below—stood a crowd of people, side by side, everyone looking, but everyone quiet, all waiting, all silent! his heart skipped a beat, his feet wouldn’t budge, and he felt rooted to the spot. . . . he wanted to cry out and—woke up. he took a deep breath—but, strangely, his dream seemed to continue: his door was wide open and a complete stranger stood on the threshold, staring at him fixedly. raskolnikov had not quite opened his eyes completely when he shut them again. he lay on his back and didn’t stir. “is this still my dream or not?” he wondered and opened his eyelids ever so slightly to take a look: the stranger stood on the same spot and was still staring at him. all at once he carefully stepped over the threshold, closed the door behind himself thoughtfully, walked over to the table, waited a minute—all this time not taking his eyes off raskolnikov—and quietly, without a sound, sat down on a chair next to the sofa. he placed his hat to one side, on the floor, and rested both of his hands on his cane, lowering his chin to his hands. it was apparent that he was prepared to wait a long time. as much as raskolnikov could see through his eyelashes, this man was no longer young; he was solidly built and had a thick, light-colored, almost white beard . . . about ten minutes passed. it was still light, but evening was already setting in. it was absolutely still in the room. not a sound was drifting in, even from the staircase. only a large fly kept buzzing and beating against the windowpane. at last this became unbearable; raskolnikov suddenly raised himself and sat up on the sofa. “well, say something. what do you want?” “i knew that you weren’t asleep, but merely pretending,” the stranger replied peculiarly, grinning serenely. “allow me to introduce myself: arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov . . .” oceanofpdf.com i “c an this really be the continuation of my dream?” raskolnikov wondered again. he stared cautiously and distrustfully at the unexpected guest. “svidrigaylov? what nonsense! it couldn’t be!” he uttered aloud at last, in perplexity. the visitor did not seem surprised at all by this exclamation. “i’ve come to see you for two reasons: first, for some time i’ve heard extremely interesting and favorable reports of you, and i wanted to"
dostoevsky,"make your acquaintance; second, i hope that perhaps you won’t refuse to assist me in an undertaking that directly concerns the interests of your sister, avdotya romanovna. as a result of prejudice, she might not agree to see me alone without a recommendation; on the other hand, with your help, i can count on . . .” “you count badly,” raskolnikov interrupted him. “may i ask if they just arrived yesterday?” raskolnikov made no reply. “yesterday, i know. i myself arrived only two days ago. well, sir, this is what i have to say to you on that score, rodion romanovich; i consider it unnecessary to justify myself, but allow me to inquire: in this entire affair, was there, as a matter of fact, anything criminal on my part, that is, judging sensibly and without prejudice?” raskolnikov continued examining him in silence. “the fact that in my own home i pursued a defenseless young woman and ‘insulted her with my vile proposals’—is that it? (i’m jumping ahead!) but you must assume that i’m merely a human being, et nihil humanum * . . . in a word, that i’m capable of being attracted and falling in love (which, of course, doesn’t depend on our own will); then everything can be explained in the most natural manner. here the whole question is: am i a monster or a victim myself? well, how can i be a victim? when i proposed to the object of my affections that she run away with me to america or switzerland, perhaps i nourished the most honorable feelings in myself and even thought i was making arrangements for our mutual happiness! one’s reason serves one’s passions; perhaps i did more harm to myself than to anyone else!” “that’s not the point,” raskolnikov interrupted with disgust. “you’re simply repulsive, whether you’re right or not. they don’t even want to know you, and they want you to leave. so go away!” svidrigaylov suddenly burst out laughing. “however . . . however, there’s no way of knocking you off track!” he said, laughing in a most sincere manner. “i thought i could outwit you, but no, right away you put your finger exactly on the main point!” “you continue trying to outwit me even now.” “what if i do? what if i do?” repeated svidrigaylov, laughing aloud. “it’s what’s called bonne guerre, † and the most permissible deceit! but you interrupted me all the same. one way or another, i can state once more: there would’ve been no unpleasantness if it hadn’t been for the incident in the garden. marfa petrovna . . .” “they say you also hastened marfa petrovna’s end,” raskolnikov interrupted rudely. “you’ve heard about that, too? but how could you not have heard? well, as far as that question of yours is concerned, i really don’t know what to say, although my own conscience is absolutely clear on that score. that is, don’t think i’m afraid of anything related to that matter. it was all conducted in accord with absolute order and complete accuracy; the medical investigation determined that it was apoplexy resulting from bathing too soon after consuming a heavy meal, including almost a full bottle of wine; they couldn’t come to any other conclusion. . . . no, sir, here’s what i’ve been thinking to myself for some time, especially on the way here, while sitting on the train: didn’t i contribute in some way to this entire unfortunate episode, through some moral disturbance or something of that sort? but i concluded that it couldn’t possibly be the case.” raskolnikov started laughing. “why should you worry about that?” “what are you laughing at? just think: i struck her only twice with a riding switch; it didn’t even leave any marks. . . . please, don’t think i’m a cynic; i certainly know how vile it was on my part, and so forth; but i also know for sure that marfa petrovna might even have been pleased by my display of passion, so to speak. the business concerning your sister had been wrung out to the last drop. marfa petrovna had been forced to stay at home for two days; there was no reason for her to go into town; everyone was fed up with that letter of hers. (did you hear about the reading of that letter?) suddenly these two blows of the switch came down upon her like a bolt out of the blue. the first thing she did was order the carriage to be harnessed! i’m not even referring to the fact that women sometimes find it very, very pleasant when they’re insulted, in spite of their apparent indignation. they all have these moments; have you noticed that, in general, people like being insulted very, very much? but it’s particularly true for women. one can even say that it’s the only thing they subsist on.” for a while raskolnikov thought about getting up and leaving to end the meeting. but a certain curiosity and even some calculation restrained him for a moment. “do you like to fight?” he asked absentmindedly. “no, not much,” svidrigaylov replied calmly. “i almost never fought with marfa petrovna. we lived very amicably, and she was always content with me. i used a riding switch only twice during all our seven years together (if you don’t count a third time that was, however, extremely ambiguous): the first time—two months after our marriage, right after our arrival in the country, and now this latest incident. did you think i was some sort of monster, a reactionary, or a taskmaster? ha, ha. . . . by the way, don’t you recall, rodion romanovich, how several years ago, during the time of beneficial openness, a certain landowner—i forgot his name!—was slandered for having beaten a german woman in a railway car, don’t you remember? at that time, in that same year, it seems that ‘the disgraceful act of the century’ occurred. (well, do you recall the public reading of pushkin’s"
dostoevsky,"egyptian nights ? ‡ those dark eyes? oh, where is the golden age of our youth?) well, sir, here’s my opinion: i don’t sympathize at all with the gentleman who struck that german woman, because, as a matter of fact, what’s there to sympathize with? but at the same time, how can i not state that at times one comes across such provocative ‘german women’ that, it seems to me, not a single progressive person could manage to answer for himself. at the time nobody regarded the incident from this point of view, yet it’s the genuinely humane one, it really is, sir.” after saying this, svidrigaylov suddenly burst out laughing again. it was clear to raskolnikov that this man was someone whose mind was firmly set on something and who was also very crafty. “you must have spent several days without anyone to talk to,” raskolnikov said. “almost. why do you ask? are you surprised that i’m such an obliging fellow?” “no, i’m surprised that you’re too obliging.” “because i haven’t been offended by the rudeness of your questions? that’s it, isn’t it? yes . . . why should i be offended? you’ve asked and i’ve answered,” he added with an astonishing expression of openheartedness. “i’m not particularly interested in anything at all, so help me god,” he continued pensively. “especially now, not busy with anything. . . . however, you may think i’m trying to ingratiate myself with you for some reason, all the more so since i have business with your sister, as i myself stated. but i’ll tell you candidly: i’m very bored! especially these last three days, so i’m even glad to see you. . . . don’t be angry, rodion romanovich, but for some reason you yourself seem terribly strange to me. as you wish, but there’s something about you: precisely now—that is, not at this very minute, but now in general. . . . well, well, i won’t, i won’t, don’t be so overcast! i’m not such a boor as you think.” raskolnikov regarded him gloomily. “perhaps you’re not a boor at all,” he said. “it even seems to me that you come from very good society or, at least, if need be, you know how to behave like a decent person.” “i’m not particularly interested in anyone’s opinion,” svidrigaylov replied matter-of-factly, even with a hint of arrogance. “and therefore why not be a vulgarian for a while, when it’s so appropriate to appear as such in our climate and . . . and especially if one’s naturally inclined to be so,” he added, laughing again. “i’ve heard, however, that you have many acquaintances here. you’re someone who’s said to be ‘not lacking in connections.’ what use do you have for me, unless it’s for some special purpose?” “you’re right that i have acquaintances,” svidrigaylov replied, bypassing the main point. “i’ve already met with them; i’ve been wasting time here for the last two days; i recognize them, and they seem to know me. the fact is, i’m well dressed and a person of considerable means; even the peasant reforms passed us by: my income, derived from forests and water meadows, remains undiminished. but . . . i won’t go back there; i was already sick of all that. i’ve been wandering around here for three days, and i haven’t seen anyone. . . . what a city this is! i mean, how did we create it, tell me please! a city of clerks and all sorts of seminarians! true, there’s much that i didn’t notice before, about eight years ago, when i was whiling away my time around here. . . . but now i’m counting only on anatomy, so help me god!” “what kind of anatomy?” “i mean those clubs, those dussot’s, and those spits of land, § perhaps, that’s progress for you—well, that’ll all be without me,” he continued, once more taking no note of the question. “besides, who wants to be a cardsharp?” “were you also a cardsharp?” “how could we have done without that? we made up a whole group, extremely respectable, some eight years ago; we spent time together; and, you know, we were people of refined manners, some poets, some capitalists. in general, in russian society, those with the best manners are those who have been beaten—did you ever notice that? i only let myself go when i moved to the country. nevertheless, they almost put me in jail then for my debts, and for some trouble with that greek from nezhin. that’s when marfa petrovna happened to show up, bargained with him, and ransomed me for thirty thousand silver rubles. (i owed a total of seventy thousand.) we were legally married, and she carried me off at once to her estate in the country, as if i were her treasure. she was five years my senior. she loved me. i didn’t leave the country for seven years. note well: all her life she held that document for thirty thousand against me, made out in someone else’s name, so if i ever took it into my head to rebel, i’d fall right into the trap! and she’d have done it! women have no trouble reconciling such things.” “if it hadn’t been for that document, would you have flown the coop?” “i don’t know what to say. i was hardly constrained by that document. i didn’t want to travel anywhere; marfa petrovna invited me to go abroad several times, seeing that i was bored. so what? i had been abroad before and had always found it sickening. there was no particular reason: you look and the dawn comes up, there’s the bay of naples, the sea, and somehow one feels sad. the worst part is that you really do feel sad about something! no, it’s better to stay in one’s own country: here, at least, you can blame other people for everything and manage to justify yourself. now i might join an expedition to the north pole,"
dostoevsky,"because j’ai le vin mauvais ; ¶ i hate drinking and, besides that, there’s nothing else left to do. i’ve tried. they say that on sunday berg is going to attempt an ascent in an enormous hot-air balloon in the yusupov garden, # and that he’s inviting passengers for a fee. is that true?” “would you go up with him?” “me? no . . . just so . . .” svidrigaylov muttered, as if considering seriously it. “is he really serious?” wondered raskolnikov. “no, the document didn’t constrain me,” svidrigaylov continued pensively. “it was my own decision to stay in the country. soon it’ll be a year since marfa petrovna returned that document to me on my name day and, in addition, presented me with a significant sum of money. she had her own capital. ‘you see how i trust you, arkady ivanovich,’ that’s just how she put it. you don’t believe that’s what she said? then know this: i became a respectable landowner in the country; i’m well known in the neighborhood. i also used to order some books by mail. at first marfa petrovna approved, but then she grew afraid that i’d overdo it.” “it seems you really miss marfa petrovna?” “me? possibly. it really is possible. by the way, do you believe in ghosts?” “what kind of ghosts?” “ordinary ghosts. what do you mean, what kind?” “and do you believe in them?” “not really, pour vous plaire . ** . . . that is, i don’t really dis­- believe . . .” “have you ever seen any?” svidrigaylov regarded him somehow oddly. “marfa petrovna’s kind enough to visit me,” he said, curling his mouth into a strange smile. “what do you mean, visit you?” “she’s come to see me three times already. i saw her first on the very day of her funeral, an hour after we were at the cemetery. it was on the eve of my departure to come here. the second time was two days ago, en route, at dawn, at the malaya vishera station; and the third time was two hours ago, at the apartment where i’m staying, in my room. i was alone.” “were you awake?” “absolutely. i was awake all three times. she comes, chats for a minute or two, and then leaves by the door, always by the door. it’s even as if i can hear the door open and close.” “why was it that i thought something like that might happen to you?” raskolnikov remarked suddenly and was astonished at the same time that he had said it. he was very agitated. “so-o-o. you really thought that?” svidrigaylov asked in amazement. “really? well, didn’t i say that there was a common bond between us, eh?” “you never said that!” raskolnikov replied abruptly and heatedly. “didn’t i?” “no!” “it seemed to me that i did. just before, when i came in and saw that you were lying there with your eyes closed, pretending to sleep—right then i said to myself, ‘he’s the one!’ ” “what do you mean, ‘the one’? what are you talking about?” cried raskolnikov. “what am i talking about? i really don’t know,” svidrigaylov mumbled frankly and seemed somehow confused. they were silent for a minute. they both stared at each other with rapt attention. “it’s all nonsense!” raskolnikov cried with irritation. “what does she say to you when she comes to visit?” “she? just imagine, she talks about the most trivial things; you have to marvel at her: that’s just what makes me so angry. the first time she came (you know, i was tired: the funeral service, the hymns, then the litany, and the meal—at last i remained alone in my study; i lit up a cigar and was lost in thought), she entered in through the door. ‘and you,’ she says, ‘arkady ivanovich, in the midst of all your bustle today, you forgot to wind the clock in the dining room.’ as a matter of fact, all seven years i myself used to wind the clock once a week, and if i forgot—she’d always remind me. the next day i was already on my way here. i arrived at the station at daybreak—i’d dozed off during the night, exhausted, barely able to keep my eyes open—to get some coffee; i look—and marfa petrovna suddenly sits down next to me, holding a deck of cards. ‘shall i tell your fortune for the trip with these cards, arkady ivanovich?’ she was a master at fortune-telling. i won’t ever forgive myself for not letting her do it! frightened, i ran away, and just then i heard the bell announce the train. today i was sitting with a full stomach after a terrible dinner from an eating house—i was sitting there and smoking—all of a sudden marfa petrovna shows up again, all dressed up, in her new green silk dress with a very long train. ‘how do you do, arkady ivanovich! how do you like my dress? aniska doesn’t make them like this.’ (aniska’s the seamstress in the country, a former serf, who learned to sew in moscow—she’s a pretty girl.) she stood there and turned around in front of me. i examined the dress, then looked carefully into her face: ‘why, marfa petrovna, do you come to see me and trouble me with such trivial matters?’ ‘ah, good lord, my dear, it’s impossible to trouble you with anything!’ i say to tease her: ‘marfa petrovna, i want to get married.’ ‘that’s just like you, arkady ivanovich; it’s not very honorable: you’ve hardly managed to bury your wife, and you want to go off and get married. if you could only choose well, but i know that nothing will come of it either for her or for you, and you’ll only make good people laugh.’ she said this and then up and left; her train seemed to rustle as she went out. what nonsense, isn’t it?” “perhaps you’re just telling lies,” replied raskolnikov. “i rarely tell lies,” answered"
dostoevsky,"svidrigaylov pensively, as if not noticing the rudeness of the question. “and before this, did you ever see any ghosts?” “n . . . no, well, i did, only once, six years ago. i had a house serf, filka; we’d just buried him. i forgot that and shouted, ‘filka, bring me my pipe!’ and he came in and went right to the cabinet where i keep my pipes. i sat there thinking, ‘he’s taking revenge on me’ because we’d had a bad quarrel just before his death. ‘how dare you,’ i said, ‘appear before me with a torn shirt? get out, you scoundrel!’ he turned and left and never came again. at the time, i didn’t tell marfa petrovna. i was about to have a memorial service said for him, but then i felt ashamed.” “you should see a doctor.” “i’m aware without your help that i’m not well, but i really don’t know what’s the matter with me; in my opinion, i’m five times healthier than you are. i didn’t ask whether you believe that people see ghosts. i asked whether you believe that ghosts exist.” “no, nothing could make me believe that!” raskolnikov cried, even with some malice. “what do people usually say?” muttered svidrigaylov, as if to himself, looking to one side and tilting his head slightly. “they say, ‘you must be ill; what you see is merely the result of unreal delirium.’ but there’s no strict logic to that. i agree that ghosts appear only to sick people, but that merely proves that they can appear only to sick people, and not that they don’t exist at all.” “of course they don’t,” raskolnikov insisted irritably. “they don’t? is that what you think?” continued svidrigaylov, regarding him steadily. “well, let’s say we reason like this (help me out here!): ‘ghosts, so to speak, are shreds and fragments of other worlds, their beginning. a healthy person, naturally, has no need to see them because he’s primarily a being of this earth; therefore, he must live only his earthly life, for fullness’ sake and for orderliness. but if he falls slightly ill, if the normal earthly order of the organism is destroyed, then the possibility of another world begins to open up; the sicker the person, the more contact with the other world, so that when this person dies, he passes immediately into the other world.’ i started to think about this a long time ago. if you believe in a future life, then you can believe in this line of reasoning.” “i don’t believe in a future life,” said raskolnikov. svidrigaylov sat there, deep in thought. “what if there are only spiders there or something of that sort?” he said suddenly. “he’s insane,” thought raskolnikov. “eternity is always presented to us as an idea that we can’t grasp, as something enormous, enormous! why does it have to be enormous? all of a sudden, instead of all that, imagine there’ll be a little room, something like a country bathhouse, sooty, with spiders in all the corners, and that’s the whole of eternity. you know, i sometimes imagine it like that.” “but surely, surely you can imagine something more consoling and more just than that?” raskolnikov cried, feeling pained. “more just? how can we know? perhaps that is just, and, you know, i’d arrange it exactly like that!” replied svidrigaylov, smiling vaguely. a chill seized raskolnikov at this hideous answer. svidrigaylov raised his head, stared at him intently, and burst out laughing. “no, just think about this,” he cried. “a half hour ago, we’d never seen each other, we considered ourselves enemies, with some unfinished business between us; we left that matter behind, and now look at how far we’ve come! well, wasn’t i telling the truth when i said that we were both cut from the same cloth?” “do me a favor,” raskolnikov continued with irritation. “allow me to ask you to explain yourself immediately and inform me as to why you’ve bestowed the honor of a visit on me . . . and . . . and . . . i’m in a hurry, i have no time, and i have to leave soon . . .” “certainly, certainly. your sister, avdotya romanovna, is planning to marry petr petrovich luzhin, right?” “might it be possible somehow to sidestep any questions about my sister and not mention her name? i don’t even understand how you dare utter her name in my presence, if you really are svidrigaylov.” “but i came precisely to talk about her; how can i help mentioning her name?” “all right; speak, but quickly!” “i’m sure that you have already formed an opinion about this mr. luzhin, a relative of mine through marriage, even if you spent only a half hour with him or heard something about him reported faithfully and accurately. he’s no match for avdotya romanovna. in my opinion, avdotya romanovna is sacrificing herself in an extremely generous and improvident manner for . . . for her family. it seemed to me, as a result of all i’ve heard about you, that you, on your part, would be very pleased if this marriage could be broken off without harming her interests. now, having met you personally, i’m even sure of this.” “this is all very innocent, coming from you; excuse me, i wanted to say ‘impudent,’ ” said raskolnikov. “that is, you wish to say that i’m concerned only for my own interests. don’t worry, rodion romanovich. if i were concerned only for my own advantage, i wouldn’t have spoken so openly; i’m not such a fool after all. on this score i’ll reveal a psychological oddity to you. a little while ago, justifying my own love for avdotya romanovna, i said that i myself was a victim. well, you should know that i feel no love for her now, none at all; i even think it strange that i experienced something before . . .” “due to your idleness and depravity,” raskolnikov interrupted."
dostoevsky,"“i really am a depraved and idle person. besides, your sister has so many fine qualities that how could i not be somewhat enthralled by them? but this is all nonsense, as i see now.” “have you known this for long?” “i began noticing it even before; i was convinced of it for sure two days ago, almost at the very moment when i arrived in petersburg. besides, while still in moscow i imagined that i was coming here to seek avdotya romanovna’s hand and become mr. luzhin’s rival.” “excuse me for interrupting you. do me a favor: is it possible to curtail your account and get right to the purpose of your visit? i’m in a hurry and have to leave . . .” “with the greatest pleasure. having arrived here and now having decided to undertake a certain . . . voyage, i’d like to carry out all the necessary preliminary arrangements. my children have remained with their aunt; they’re well off, and they don’t need me at all. and besides, what sort of father am i? i’ve retained only the money that marfa petrovna gave me a year ago. that will suffice for me. excuse me, now i’ll move on to the matter at hand. before this trip that i may undertake, i wish to conclude my business with mr. luzhin. it’s not that i can’t stand him, but he was the cause of my quarrel with marfa petrovna, when i found out that she had concocted this wedding. now i wish to arrange a meeting with avdotya romanovna through your good offices, and perhaps, in your presence, explain to her, in the first place, that not only will she receive not the least gain from mr. luzhin, but also that it will certainly entail even a significant loss. then, begging her forgiveness for all the recent unpleasantness, i would ask her permission to present her with ten thousand rubles, thus enabling a break with mr. luzhin, which i am sure she would not oppose if it were possible.” “you’re insane, really, insane!” cried raskolnikov, not so much angry as astonished. “how dare you speak like this?” “i knew that you’d holler; but, in the first place, even though i’m not wealthy, i have ten thousand rubles to spare, that is, i have absolutely, absolutely no need for them. if avdotya romanovna doesn’t accept them, i’ll probably spend them even more foolishly. that’s the first thing. secondly: my conscience is completely clear; i have no ulterior motives in making this offer. believe it or not, but later both you and avdotya romanovna will find that out. the thing is that i really did cause significant trouble and unpleasantness to your sister, whom i greatly respect; therefore, feeling genuine remorse, i sincerely desire—not to redeem myself financially or pay her for the unpleasantness, but simply to do something advantageous for her, on the grounds that i have not reserved the right for myself to perform only evil acts. if in my proposal there was even a one-millionth part of calculation, i wouldn’t have made it so openly; and i wouldn’t be offering her only ten thousand, when only five weeks ago i was offering her more. besides, very, very soon i may be marrying a young woman, and consequently, that fact alone should eliminate any suspicion that i still have designs on avdotya romanovna. in conclusion, i will say that in marrying mr. luzhin, avdotya romanovna will be accepting the same money, only from a different source. . . . don’t be angry, rodion romanovich; consider this calmly and coolly.” while saying this, svidrigaylov himself was extremely calm and cool. “i ask you to finish,” said raskolnikov. “in any case, it’s unforgivably insolent.” “not at all. if that were the case, a person could only do evil to another person in this world, and wouldn’t have the right to do even a tiny bit of good, because of empty conventional formalities. that’s absurd. if, for example, i were to die and leave this sum of money to your sister in my will, would she really refuse to accept it?” “very possibly.” “i doubt that, sir. however, if so, then let it be so. but ten thousand—is a fine thing on occasion. in any case, i ask you to convey my offer to avdotya romanovna.” “no, i won’t.” “in that case, rodion romanovich, i myself will be forced to seek a private meeting with her, which would mean upsetting her.” “and if i convey the message, you won’t seek a private meeting?” “i really don’t know what to say. i’d very much like to see her once.” “don’t count on it.” “i’m sorry. however, you don’t know me. perhaps we’ll become closer.” “you think we’ll become closer?” “why not?” svidrigaylov said with a smile, standing and picking up his hat. “i really didn’t come here wishing to trouble you for long; i wasn’t even expecting very much, although this morning your physiognomy impressed me . . .” “where did you see me this morning?” raskolnikov asked uneasily. “by chance, sir. . . . it seems to me that in some way you’re very similar to me. . . . don’t be upset; i’m not a bore; i got on with cardsharps, i didn’t bore prince svirbey, my distant relative and grandee, i was able to write in mrs. prilukova’s album about raphael’s painting of the madonna, i spent seven years with marfa petrovna without leaving the country, i spent nights in vyazemsky’s lodging house on haymarket square in the old days, and perhaps i’ll go up in berg’s hot-air balloon.” “well, all right, sir. allow me to ask, will you leave on your travels soon?” “what travels?” “that is, on your ‘voyage’? you said it yourself.” “on my voyage? ah, yes! as a matter of fact, i did mention a voyage. . . . well, that’s a very big question. . . . if you only knew what you"
dostoevsky,"were asking!” he added suddenly in a loud voice and gave a brief laugh. “perhaps, instead of a voyage, i’ll get married; they’re trying to find me a bride.” “here?” “yes.” “when did you find time for that?” “i’d very much like to meet with avdotya romanovna once. i’m making a serious request. well, good-bye. . . . ah, yes! here’s what i forgot! tell your sister, rodion romanovich, that she was left three thousand rubles in marfa petrovna’s will. that’s definitely the case. marfa petrovna made the arrangement a week before she died, and it was in my presence. avdotya romanovna can receive the money in about two or three weeks’ time.” “are you telling the truth?” “yes. tell her. well, sir, i’m at your service. i’m staying not far from here.” as he was leaving, svidrigaylov met razumikhin in the doorway. * part of a common misquotation from a comedy by the roman playwright terence: “i am a man: nothing human is alien to me” (latin). † “fair enough” (french). literally, “a good war.” ‡ a newspaper article published in attacked a woman in perm who read pushkin’s unfinished short story “egyptian nights” “shamelessly and with provocative gestures.” § dussot’s was a famous hotel and restaurant in st. petersburg; the spit of land is probably a reference to the fashionable spot at the end of yelagin island. ¶ “drinking makes me mean” (french). # wilhelm berg was a showman and adventurer who organized hot-air balloon rides in petersburg. ** “to please you” (french). oceanofpdf.com ii i t was already almost eight o’clock; they both were hurrying to bakaleev’s house, hoping to arrive before luzhin did. “well, who was that?” asked razumikhin as soon as they got out to the street. “it was svidrigaylov, that same landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was working there as a governess. she left as a result of his amorous advances, driven away by his wife, marfa petrovna. afterward this same marfa petrovna asked dunya’s forgiveness, and now she’s suddenly died. we were talking about her a while ago. i don’t know why, but i’m afraid of that man. he arrived here right after his wife’s funeral. he’s very strange and has resolved to do something. . . . it’s as if he knows something. . . . dunya must be protected from him . . . that’s what i wanted to tell you, you hear?” “protected! what can he do to avdotya romanovna? well, thank you, rodya, for telling me this. . . . we’ll, we’ll protect her! where does he live?” “i don’t know.” “why didn’t you ask? hey, it’s a pity! but i’ll find out!” “did you see him?” asked raskolnikov after a silence. “yes, i did; i got a good look at him.” “did you really see him? clearly?” insisted raskolnikov. “yes, i clearly remember him; i could pick him out of a thousand. i have a good memory for faces.” they were both silent again for a while. “hmm . . . all right,” muttered raskolnikov. “otherwise, you know . . . i wondered . . . it seemed to me . . . that it might have been an apparition.” “what are you talking about? i don’t understand you very well.” “all of you keep insisting,” raskolnikov continued, twisting his mouth into a smile, “that i’m mad; it seemed to me now that perhaps i really am mad and that i just saw an apparition!” “what are you saying?” “but who knows? perhaps i really am mad, and everything that’s happened these last few days, everything, perhaps has only been in my imagination . . .” “hey, rodya! they’ve upset you again! what did he say? why did he come?” raskolnikov made no reply. razumikhin thought for a moment. “well, listen to my report,” he began. “i dropped in on you and you were asleep. then i had dinner and went to see porfiry. zametov was still with him. i tried to speak, but nothing came of it. i couldn’t find the right way to say it. it’s as if they really don’t understand and won’t be able to, but they’re not ashamed of it. i drew porfiry over to the window and began talking to him, but once again nothing came of it: he looked away and i did, too. finally, i raised my fist to his mug and said that i’d smash him, in a familial sort of way. he merely looked at me. i spat and left, and that was that. it was very foolish. i didn’t exchange a word with zametov. only you see: i thought that i’d ruined things, but then, as i was going down the stairs, i had an idea, it dawned on me: what are we worrying about? if there was any danger to you, or anything of the sort, then of course. but what’s it to you? you’re not involved in it, so the hell with them; we’ll laugh at them later; and if i were in your place, i’d still try to mystify them further. they’ll be so ashamed afterward! the hell with them; later we can beat them up, but for now, we’ll just laugh!” “of course, that’s true,” replied raskolnikov. “what will you say tomorrow?” he wondered to himself. strange to say, but up until this moment it never occurred to him to wonder, “what will razumikhin think when he finds out?” with this thought, raskolnikov stared at him intently. he was not much interested in razumikhin’s account of his visit to porfiry: so much had been lost and gained since then! in the corridor they bumped into luzhin: he showed up precisely at eight o’clock and was searching for the number of the room, so all three of them entered together, but without looking at or greeting each other. the young men went in first; for propriety’s sake, petr petrovich hesitated a while in the entryway, taking off his coat."
dostoevsky,"pulkheriya aleksandrovna came out promptly to meet him on the threshold. dunya greeted her brother. petr petrovich came in and rather politely, although with redoubled solemnity, exchanged bows with the ladies. however, he looked as if he was a bit confused and had yet to recover. pulkheriya aleksandrovna also seemed a bit embarrassed and immediately hastened to seat them all at a round table where a samovar was boiling. dunya and luzhin were seated diametrically across from each other. razumikhin and raskolnikov were facing pulkheriya aleksandrovna—razumikhin was closer to luzhin, raskolnikov next to his sister. there was a moment of silence. without hurrying, petr petrovich took out a cambric handkerchief that smelled of cologne and blew his nose with the look of a virtuous man, but one whose dignity was still somewhat offended, and who had firmly resolved to demand an explanation. back in the entryway, a thought occurred to him: to keep his coat on and leave, thus severely and impressively punishing the two women, and making them feel the entire situation at once. but he’d been unable to make that decision. in addition, this man didn’t appreciate uncertainty, and it was necessary to clarify the situation: if his instructions had been so blatantly ignored, that meant there was some reason for it; therefore, it was better to find out right now. there would always be time to punish them, and the power to do so was in his hands. “i hope your journey was agreeable?” he said, addressing pulkheriya aleksandrovna formally. “yes, thank god, petr petrovich.” “i’m extremely glad, ma’am. and avdotya romanovna’s not too tired, either?” “i’m young and strong; i don’t tire easily, but mama had a very difficult trip,” replied dunechka. “what’s to be done, ma’am; our national roads are extremely long. so-called mother russia is vast. . . . in spite of all my desires, i was unable to meet you yesterday. i hope, however, that everything went without any particular difficulties.” “alas, no, petr petrovich. we felt very disheartened,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna hastened to declare, with a special intonation. “and if god himself hadn’t sent us dmitry prokofich yesterday, we’d have been completely at a loss. here he is, dmitry prokofich razumikhin,” she added, introducing him to luzhin. “why, i’ve already had the pleasure . . . yesterday,” muttered luzhin, with an unfriendly sidelong glance at razumikhin; then he frowned and fell silent. in general, petr petrovich belonged to that category of people who appear to be extremely cordial in society and, especially, affect politeness but who, once something is not to their liking, immediately lose all their good qualities and begin to resemble sacks of flour more than relaxed and animated society gentlemen. everyone fell silent once again: raskolnikov was stubbornly silent, avdotya romanovna didn’t want to interrupt the silence prematurely, razumikhin had nothing to say, and so pulkheriya aleksandrovna felt anxious again. “have you heard that marfa petrovna died?” she began, resorting to her main topic of conversation. “why yes, i did hear that, ma’am. i was one of the first to learn, and i even came to tell you that arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov, not long after his spouse’s funeral, set off at once for petersburg. that, at least, is the latest news i received.” “petersburg? here?” dunechka asked anxiously, exchanging glances with her mother. “precisely so, ma’am; of course, not without some purpose, taking into account the hastiness of his departure and, in general, the previous circumstances.” “good lord! will he really not leave dunechka in peace even here?” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “it seems to me there’s no particular reason for you or avdotya romanovna to be alarmed, of course, if you don’t wish to have anything to do with him. as for me, i’m making inquiries and will discover where he’s staying . . .” “ah, petr petrovich, you won’t believe how you frightened me just now!” continued pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “i’ve seen him only twice, but he seemed horrible to me, horrible! i’m sure that he was the cause of marfa petrovna’s death.” “it’s impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion about that. i have accurate information. i can’t argue that perhaps he contributed to hastening the course of events, so to speak, by the moral impact of his insult; but as far as his conduct is concerned and, in general, the moral character of the person himself, i’m in agreement with you. i don’t know if he’s rich now, or how much precisely marfa petrovna left him; i’ll find that out in a very short time; but, of course, here in petersburg, even having any financial resources at hand, he’ll resume his former course of action. of all people of that kind, he’s the most depraved man and entirely devoted to vice! i have substantial grounds to assume that marfa petrovna, who had the misfortune of loving him and redeeming him from his debts eight years ago, was of service to him in another respect: it was only her efforts and her sacrifice that resulted in suppressing at the outset a criminal matter with an element of beastly and, so to speak, fantastical murder, for which he might very well have been sent packing to siberia. that’s the sort of man he is, if you want to know.” “ah, lord!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. raskolnikov was listening carefully. “are you telling the truth when you say you have accurate knowledge of this?” asked dunya, sternly and imposingly. “i’m only saying what i myself heard in secret from the late marfa petrovna. i must observe that from a legal standpoint, this matter is extremely obscure. a certain woman by the name of resslikh was living here, and it seems, still does; she’s a foreigner and, furthermore, a petty moneylender who also engaged in other sorts of business. mr. svidrigaylov was recently involved with this resslikh in some extremely close and mysterious relations. a distant relative was living with her, a niece, it seems, a deaf-mute, a girl of about fifteen or"
dostoevsky,"even fourteen, whom this resslikh despised intensely, reproaching her for every crumb she ate; she even used to beat her mercilessly. one day she was found hanging in the attic. it was ruled a suicide. after the usual procedures, the matter was even concluded, but subsequently it was alleged that the child had been . . . cruelly abused by svidrigaylov. true, all this is obscure; the testimony came from another german lady, an inveterate liar whose word had no credibility; finally, in the end, no formal charge was brought, thanks to marfa petrovna’s efforts and money; it was all limited to rumors. however, these rumors were very significant. of course, avdotya romanovna, you’ve also heard, while at their house, the story of the servant filipp, who died from being tormented some six years ago, still during the time of serfdom.” “on the contrary, i heard that this filipp hanged himself.” “exactly so, ma’am, but mr. svidrigaylov’s continual regime of persecutions and punishments compelled him or, more accurately, inclined him to his violent end.” “i don’t know that for certain,” dunya replied drily. “i’ve heard only a very strange tale that this filipp was some sort of hypochondriac, a kind of homespun philosopher; people said that he ‘read himself silly,’ and that he hanged himself more as a result of taunts, and not as a result of mr. svidrigaylov’s beatings. in my presence, he treated other people well; the serfs even loved him, although they also accused him of filipp’s death.” “i see, avdotya romanovna, that you’re suddenly inclined to defend him,” observed luzhin, twisting his mouth into an ambiguous grin. “he’s really a devious man and very captivating with ladies; marfa petrovna, who died so strangely, stands as a pitiful example of this. i merely hoped my advice would serve you and your mama, in light of his new, undoubtedly imminent attempts. as far as i’m concerned, i’m absolutely convinced that this man will certainly vanish again into debtors’ prison. marfa petrovna never really had the intention of providing him with any security, considering her own children, and if she left him anything, then it must have been only the most necessary, insignificant, temporary sum, which wouldn’t suffice a man with his habits for even a year.” “petr petrovich, i beg you,” said dunya, “let’s not talk about svidrigaylov. the subject bores me.” “he just came to see me,” raskolnikov said suddenly, breaking his silence for the first time. exclamations arose on all sides, and everyone turned to him. even petr petrovich was agitated. “he came into my room about an hour and a half ago, while i was asleep; he woke me and introduced himself,” continued raskolnikov. “he was rather relaxed and cheerful, and is absolutely certain that he and i will become close. meanwhile, he’d very much like and is hoping to arrange a meeting with you, dunya, and he’s asked me to serve as an intermediary. he has a proposal to make to you; he told me what it is. besides that, he informed me unequivocally that a week before her death, marfa petrovna, in her will, arranged to leave you, dunya, the sum of three thousand rubles, and that you’ll be able to receive that money very soon.” “thank god!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna, crossing herself. “pray for her, dunya, pray for her!” “it’s absolutely true,” luzhin blurted out. “well, what else is there?” dunechka hastened to ask. “then he said that he himself was not wealthy and that his entire estate would pass to his children, who are now living with their aunt. then he said that he was staying not far from me, but where—i don’t know and didn’t ask . . .” “but what is it, what on earth is he proposing to dunechka?” asked the frightened pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “did he tell you?” “he did.” “what then?” “i’ll tell you later.” raskolnikov fell silent and turned to his tea. petr petrovich took out his watch and looked at it. “i have to attend to some business and, thus, will not interfere,” he added with a somewhat offended look and began to rise from his place. “stay here, petr petrovich,” said dunya. “you intended to spend the evening here. besides, you yourself wrote that you wished to discuss some matter with my mother.” “precisely so, avdotya romanovna,” petr petrovich said imposingly, sitting down in his chair again, but keeping his hat in his hands. “i really did wish to have a discussion with you and your much-esteemed mother, even about some very important matters. but just as your brother can’t discuss certain proposals made by mr. svidrigaylov in my presence, i also don’t wish and can’t converse . . . in the presence of others . . . about certain extremely, extremely important matters. besides, my principal and most pressing request was not fulfilled . . .” luzhin made a sour face and fell into a dignified silence. “your request that my brother not be present during our meeting was not honored only as a result of my insistence,” said dunya. “you wrote that you’d been insulted by my brother; i think that the matter should be discussed immediately and that you should make peace. if rodya really did insult you, then he must and will beg your forgiveness.” petr petrovich immediately took heart. “there are some insults, avdotya romanovna, that, in spite of all goodwill, cannot be forgotten, ma’am. there’s a line in everything that’s dangerous to cross; once having done so, it’s impossible to go back.” “that’s not exactly what i was talking about, petr petrovich,” dunya interrupted with some impatience. “remember that our entire future depends on whether you can clear all this up and be reconciled as quickly as possible, or not. i can say honestly, from the outset, that i cannot regard this matter otherwise, and that if you value me even slightly, then, even though it’s difficult, this whole episode must be concluded today. i repeat, if my"
dostoevsky,"brother is to blame, he will ask your forgiveness.” “i’m surprised that you state the problem like that, avdotya romanovna,” luzhin said, getting more and more irritated. “while valuing and, so to speak, adoring you, it’s possible that, at the same time, i may very much dislike a member of your family. seeking the happiness of your hand in marriage, at the same time i cannot assume any obligations incompatible with . . .” “ah, drop all this touchiness, petr petrovich,” dunya interrupted with feeling, “and be the clever and noble man i’ve always considered you and still want to consider you to be. i made a big promise to you: i’m your fiancée. trust me in this matter and believe that i can reach an unbiased conclusion. the fact that i take upon myself the role of judge is as much a surprise to my brother as it is to you. when, after receiving your letter, i invited him to come without fail to our meeting today, i didn’t communicate to him any of my intentions. you must understand that if you don’t make peace, i’ll be forced to choose between you: either you or him. that’s how the question stands both for him and for you. i don’t wish to be mistaken in my choice, nor should i. for you, i’d have to break off with my brother; for my brother, i’d have to break off with you. i want to find out and will be able to learn, for certain, whether he’s a brother to me or not. and as for you: am i dear to you, do you value me: are you a husband to me or not?” “avdotya romanovna,” luzhin said, unpleasantly surprised. “your words are too loaded with meaning for me, too, i might even say, offensive in view of the position i have the honor to hold in relation to you. without saying a word about the insulting and strange juxtaposition, on one level, between me and . . . an arrogant young man, by your words you’re admitting the possibility of breaking the promise you made to me. you say, ‘it’s me or him.’ therefore, you’re demonstrating how little i mean to you. . . . i can’t allow this in the relations and . . . obligations existing between us.” “what?” cried dunya. “i place your interest alongside everything that has been precious in my life up to this point, that which comprised my entire life up to now, and suddenly you’re offended by the fact that i place too little value on you?” raskolnikov smiled silently and sarcastically; razumikhin winced deeply. but petr petrovich didn’t accept the reproach; on the contrary, he became more and more annoyed and irritated with every word, as if he were starting to enjoy it. “love for one’s future partner in life, for one’s husband, must exceed the love for one’s brother,” he announced sententiously. “in any case, i can’t stand on the same level. . . . although i insisted a while ago that in your brother’s presence i don’t wish to declare, and cannot, everything about why i came, nevertheless, i now intend to address your much-esteemed mother regarding a necessary explanation of one principal matter, one that i find offensive. yesterday your son,” he said, turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna, “in the presence of mr. rassudkin * (or . . . is that right? excuse me, i can’t remember your surname,” he said, bowing politely to razumikhin), “insulted me by distorting an idea that i conveyed to you in a private conversation, over coffee, namely, that marriage to a poor young woman, one who had already experienced hardship in life, in my opinion, was more advantageous for conjugal relations than marriage to someone who’s known prosperity, since it’s more propitious for moral development. your son deliberately exaggerated the meaning of my words to the point of absurdity, accusing me of evil intentions and, in my view, basing his allegations on your correspondence. i’d consider myself fortunate if you, pulkheriya aleksandrovna, could convince me of the opposite view and thus set my mind at ease considerably. please tell me in what terms you conveyed my words in your letter to rodion romanovich.” “i don’t recall,” said pulkheriya aleksandrovna in some confusion. “i conveyed them as i myself understood them. i don’t know what i wrote to you, rodya. . . . perhaps he even did exaggerate something.” “without your suggestion, he couldn’t have exaggerated them.” “petr petrovich,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna proclaimed in a dignified manner. “proof of the fact that dunya and i didn’t take your words amiss is that we are here.” “well said, mama!” dunya replied approvingly. “so that’s my fault as well?” luzhin said, offended. “there you go, petr petrovich, always blaming rodion, yet you yourself told an untruth about him in your letter,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna added, gathering her courage. “i don’t recall that i wrote any untruth, ma’am.” “you wrote,” raskolnikov began abruptly, without turning to luzhin, “that yesterday i gave some money not to the downtrodden widow, as i really did, but to her daughter (whom i’d never met before yesterday). you wrote this to cause a quarrel between my family and me, and you added something in vile terms about the conduct of this young woman, whom you don’t even know. all of that is gossip and baseness.” “excuse me, sir,” replied luzhin, trembling with rage. “in my letter i enlarged on your qualities and actions solely in fulfillment of your mother’s and sister’s request to describe to them the condition in which i found you and what sort of impression you made on me. as far as the matter mentioned in my letter is concerned, try to find even a single line that’s unjust—that is, that you didn’t squander your money and that, in that family, though unfortunate, there were no unworthy people.” “it’s my opinion that with all your merits, you aren’t worth the little finger of"
dostoevsky,"that unfortunate young woman at whom you’re casting stones.” “that means you’d be willing to introduce her into the company of your mother and sister?” “i’ve already done just that, if you want to know. today i sat her down right next to my mother and dunya.” “rodya!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. dunechka flushed; razumikhin knitted his brows. luzhin smiled caustically and haughtily. “you may see for yourself, avdotya romanovna,” he said, “whether any agreement is possible. i hope that now this matter is closed and cleared up once and for all. i shall leave so as not to interfere with the further pleasantness of a family meeting and in the relaying of secrets.” (he stood and picked up his hat.) “but, while leaving, i dare request that in future i hope to be spared any similar meetings and, so to speak, compromises. i want to make this request of you in particular, much-esteemed pulkheriya aleksandrovna, since my letter was addressed to you and to no one else.” pulkheriya aleksandrovna was slightly offended. “you seem to think that you already have complete power over us, petr petrovich. dunya’s told you the reason why your request was not honored: she had good intentions. besides, you were writing to me as if you were giving me orders. must we really consider your every wish our command? on the contrary, i say that now you should be particularly tactful and indulgent, because we gave up everything and, trusting you, came here; therefore, we’re almost in your power as it is.” “that’s not quite fair, pulkheriya aleksandrovna, especially at the present moment, when marfa petrovna’s bequest of three thousand rubles has just been announced, which, it seems, is very opportune, judging from the new tone you’ve adopted with me,” he added caustically. “judging from that remark, one can really suppose that you were counting on our helplessness,” dunya observed irritably. “but now, at least, i can no longer count on it and, in particular, i don’t wish to interfere with the communication of arkady ivanovich svidrigaylov’s secret proposals, which he authorized your brother to convey and which, as i see, have an important, perhaps even extremely pleasant significance for you.” “ah, my god!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. razumikhin could scarcely remain in his chair. “aren’t you ashamed now, dunya?” asked raskolnikov. “i am, rodya,” she replied. “petr petrovich, get out of here!” she turned to him, pale with rage. petr petrovich seemed not to have expected such an ending. he was relying too heavily on himself, on his power, and on the helplessness of his victims. he couldn’t believe it even now. he turned pale, and his lips began to tremble. “avdotya romanovna, if i walk out the door now, in the face of such parting words, then—consider this well—i will never come back. think it over carefully! this is my last word.” “what impudence!” cried dunya, quickly standing up from her place. “i don’t want you ever to come back!” “what? so that’s how it is!” cried luzhin, unable to believe up until the last moment in such an outcome and, therefore, having lost the thread completely. “that’s how it is! but do you know, avdotya romanovna, that i could even lodge a complaint, ma’am.” “what right do you have to talk to her like that?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna intervened angrily. “what do you have to complain about? what right do you have? do you think i’ll give my dunya away to a man such as you? go away; leave us altogether! we’re to blame for embarking on this unseemly course of action; i’m most at fault . . .” “nevertheless, pulkheriya aleksandrovna,” luzhin cried in angry fury. “you bound me by your word, and now you’re going back on it . . . and finally, finally, i was drawn in, so to speak, and have incurred expenses . . .” this last claim was so much in keeping with petr petrovich’s character that raskolnikov, growing pale from rage and his efforts to control it, suddenly could no longer restrain himself and . . . burst out laughing. but pulkheriya aleksandrovna was beside herself. “expenses? what sort of expenses? surely you don’t mean shipping our trunk? the conductor conveyed it without any charge to you. good lord, we bound you! just come to your senses, petr petrovich; it’s you who bound our hands and feet, and not we who bound you!” “enough, mama, please, that’s enough!” begged avdotya romanovna. “petr petrovich, do us a favor, get out!” “i’m going, ma’am, but only one final word!” he said, having now almost lost control of himself. “your mother, it seems, has entirely forgotten that i decided to accept you, so to speak, after the gossip in town concerning your reputation had spread throughout the entire district. disregarding public opinion for your sake and restoring your reputation, of course i could very well have counted on some requital and even have claimed your gratitude. . . . but only now have my eyes been opened! i myself see that perhaps i behaved in an exceedingly rash fashion, disregarding public opinion as i did . . .” “does he think he has nine lives, or what?” cried razumikhin, jumping up from the chair and getting ready to finish him off. “you’re a vile, evil man!” said dunya. “not a word! don’t make a move!” cried raskolnikov, restraining razumikhin. then he advanced point-blank on luzhin. “be so good as to get out!” he said softly and distinctly. “not one word more, or else . . .” petr petrovich regarded him for several seconds, his pale face distorted by malice, then turned and walked out; of course, rarely had anyone carried away such vicious hatred in his heart as this man felt toward raskolnikov. he blamed him, and him alone, for everything. it is remarkable that even as he went down the stairs, he kept imagining that the matter, perhaps, was not entirely lost, and that even, as far as the ladies"
dostoevsky,"were concerned, it was even “very, very” reparable. * a garbling of razumikhin’s surname resulting from the confusion of rassudok (reason, intellect) and razum (reason, mind). oceanofpdf.com iii t he main point was that up to the very last moment, he had in no way expected such an outcome. he kept trying to embolden himself as best he could, not even admitting the possibility that two poor and defenseless women could escape his power. his conviction was fortified by his vanity and a level of self-confidence that could best be described as self-infatuation. petr petrovich, who had fought his own way out of poverty, had become accustomed to admiring himself to an extreme degree; he valued his own intelligence and abilities highly, and even sometimes, while alone, admired his face in a mirror. but more than anything else on earth, he loved and treasured his own money, earned by his hard work and other means: it made him the equal of everything above him. now, reminding dunya with bitterness that he had decided to take her despite those nasty rumors about her, petr petrovich was speaking in complete sincerity and even feeling deep disgust toward such “black ingratitude.” meanwhile, at the time he’d proposed to dunya, he’d been completely convinced of the absurdity of all the rumors, which had been publicly refuted by marfa petrovna herself and long since discarded by the entire town, which had vindicated dunya. and he himself would not now deny the fact that he’d known it all at the time. nevertheless, he still highly valued his resolve to elevate dunya to his own level and considered it a valiant feat. when he’d spoken about it to dunya just now, he’d been expressing his secret, cherished thought, which he himself had admired more than once, and he couldn’t understand how other people could fail to admire his feat. when he’d paid his visit to raskolnikov, he had entered with the feeling of a benefactor preparing to reap the fruits and hear extremely gratifying compliments. now, of course, on his way down the stairs, he felt offended and unappreciated to the highest degree. dunya was simply indispensable to him; it was unthinkable that he might have to lose her. for some time—for several years, in fact—he had been having sweet sensual dreams about marriage, but he’d kept saving up money and biding his time. with rapture he contemplated in deep secrecy a virtuous young woman who was poor (she had to be poor), very young, very pretty, of honorable birth, well educated, and very timid, one who had experienced very many misfortunes and who would humble herself before him to such an extent that all her life she would consider him as her savior; she would venerate him, submit to him, and idolize him and only him. he devised so many scenes, so many delightful episodes in his imagination on this seductive and playful theme as he rested after a long day tending to his business affairs! and this dream of so many years had almost been realized: he was impressed by avdotya romanovna’s beauty and education; her helpless position excited him in the extreme. there was even somewhat more than he had hoped for here: a proud young woman had appeared, strong of character, virtuous, more highly educated and developed than he was (he felt this), and such a creature would be slavishly grateful to him for his valiant feat her whole life and would efface herself reverently before him, and he would lord it over her completely and without limit! it was as if on purpose, not that long before this, after considerable thought and waiting, he had decided at last to change his career definitively and enter a wider circle of activity, at the same time, little by little, moving into higher social circles, a move that he had been contemplating voluptuously for some time. . . . in a word, he had resolved to try petersburg. he knew that with a woman’s help it was possible to gain “a very great” deal. the fascination of a charming, virtuous, and educated woman could embellish his path to an astonishing degree, could attract others to him, create an aura . . . and all of this was about to fall through! this sudden, awful rupture now struck him like a clap of thunder. it was like a hideous joke, an absurdity! he had blustered only a little; he hadn’t even managed to say everything; he’d simply been joking, had gotten carried away, but it had all ended so seriously! in the end, he was already in love with dunya in his own way; he was already lording it over her in his dreams—and all of a sudden—no! tomorrow, yes, tomorrow it could all be restored, cured, corrected, and the main thing—he would destroy that insolent youth, that little boy, who was the cause of it all. with a painful feeling he recalled, also somehow unintentionally, razumikhin. . . . but on that score he soon felt at ease: “as if he could be placed on the same level with me!” but the person he really feared was svidrigaylov. . . . in a word, there were many problems ahead. “no, it’s me, i’m the one most at fault,” said dunechka, embracing and kissing her mother. “i was tempted by his money, but i swear to you, brother—i never imagined that he was such an unworthy human being. if i’d seen through him before, i never would have been tempted. don’t blame me, brother!” “god spared us, he spared us!” muttered pulkheriya aleksandrovna, but somehow unconsciously, as if still not taking in everything that had just happened. everyone rejoiced, and within five minutes they were all laughing. at times it was only dunya who turned pale and frowned, recalling recent events. pulkheriya aleksandrovna had never been able to imagine that she, too, would be so glad; even that morning, a break with luzhin had seemed to"
dostoevsky,"be a terrible misfortune. but razumikhin was in ecstasy. he was not yet able to express it all, but he was trembling as if in a fever, as if a great weight had been lifted from his chest. now he had the right to devote his whole life to them, to serve them. . . . almost anything could happen now! however, he drove away any future thoughts more apprehensively and feared his own imagination. only raskolnikov sat in the same place, almost gloomy, even distracted. he, who had insisted more than anyone on luzhin’s dismissal, now seemed to be the least interested in what had occurred. dunya couldn’t help feeling that he was still very angry with her; pulkheriya aleksandrovna kept examining him timidly. “what did svidrigaylov say to you?” dunya asked, approaching him. “ah, yes, yes!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. raskolnikov raised his head. “he very much wants to present you with ten thousand rubles and wishes to see you once in my presence.” “to see her! not for anything on earth!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “how dare he offer her money?” then raskolnikov conveyed (rather drily) his conversation with svidrigaylov, omitting mention of marfa petrovna’s ghost so as not to go into pointless material and feeling an aversion to engaging in any conversation except the most necessary. “what answer did you give him?” asked dunya. “first i said that i wouldn’t convey anything to you. then he declared that he himself would seek a meeting with you, by any means possible. he maintained that his passion for you was just a whim and that now he doesn’t feel anything. . . . he doesn’t want you to marry luzhin. . . . in general, he was full of contradictions.” “how do you explain his behavior to yourself, rodya? how did he seem to you?” “i confess that i don’t understand him very well. he offers you ten thousand, and he himself says that he’s not rich. he declares that he wants to depart for somewhere, and ten minutes later forgets that he mentioned it. suddenly he says that he also wants to get married and that a bride’s being sought for him. . . . of course, he has his own aims, and most likely they’re bad ones. but once again, it’s somehow strange to assume that if he had evil intentions concerning you, he’d go about it in such a foolish way. . . . naturally, i refused the money on your behalf, once and for all. in general he seemed very strange, and . . . even . . . to show signs of madness. but i could be mistaken; it might simply be some sort of trickery. it seems that marfa petrovna’s death made quite an impression on him . . .” “lord rest her soul!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. “i’ll pray to god for her forever and ever! what would’ve happened to us now, dunya, without those three thousand rubles? lord, it’s like a bolt from the blue! ah, rodya, this morning we had only three rubles to our name; dunechka and i were wondering if we could pawn her watch somewhere so we wouldn’t have to take any money from that man until he figured it out for himself.” dunya was too overwhelmed by svidrigaylov’s proposal. she stood there deep in thought. “he’s conceived something horrible!” she muttered to herself almost in a whisper, almost shuddering. raskolnikov observed this extreme fright. “it seems that i’ll have to see him again more than once,” he said to dunya. “we’ll follow him! i’ll track him down!” razumikhin shouted enthusiastically. “i won’t let him out of my sight! rodya’s given me permission. he himself said to me a while ago: ‘take care of my sister.’ will you allow me, avdotya romanovna?” dunya smiled and extended her hand to him, but the worried look didn’t leave her face. pulkheriya aleksandrovna glanced at her timidly; however, apparently the thought of three thousand rubles was comforting her. in a quarter of an hour, they were all engaged in the most animated conversation. even raskolnikov, though he wasn’t speaking, was listening attentively for some time. razumikhin was holding forth. “why, why should you leave?” the words flowed out of him with ecstatic feeling. “what are you going to do in that little town? the main thing is that here you’re all together and you need each other, very much so—if you understand me! well, even for just a while. . . . take me as your friend, a companion, and i assure you that we’ll devise an excellent enterprise. listen, i’ll explain the whole thing to you in detail—the whole project! this morning, before anything happened, an idea came to me. . . . here’s what it is: i have an uncle (i’ll introduce you to him; he’s an agreeable, respectable old fellow!), and this uncle has a sum of one thousand rubles; he lives on his pension and is not in need. for two years he’s been nagging me, telling me to take this thousand and pay him six percent interest. i see the point of it: he simply wants to help me; but last year i didn’t need it, and this year while i’d been waiting for him to arrive, i’d decided to take it. then, if you contribute another thousand from your three thousand, we’ll have enough in the first instance; we’ll form a partnership. and what will we do?” razumikhin started to develop his plan; he went on at length about how all the booksellers and publishers knew very little about their own merchandise, and therefore were usually bad publishers; meanwhile, good editions generally did well and produced a profit, sometimes a considerable one. razumikhin had been dreaming about the publishing business, having worked for two years at various places; he had a decent knowledge of three european languages, in spite of the fact that some six days ago he had told raskolnikov that his german was “feeble,”"
dostoevsky,"since his aim had been to convince him to take half his translation job and three rubles in advance: he’d been lying at the time, and raskolnikov had known that he was lying. “why, why should we allow this opportunity to get away when one of the most important resources has turned up—our own money?” said razumikhin heatedly. “of course, it’ll take a great deal of work, but we will work, you, avdotya romanovna, me, rodion. . . . some editions now produce a handsome profit! the mainstay of our enterprise consists in our knowing precisely what to translate. we’ll translate, publish, and study, all together. i can be useful now because i have experience. for almost two years i’ve been poking around publishers, and i know all the ins and outs: it’s not as hard as it seems, believe me! why, why should we miss this chance? i myself know, and i’ve kept it to myself, of two or three such works; the mere idea of translating and publishing them might yield one hundred rubles for each book, and for one of them i would refuse even five hundred rubles just for the idea. and what do you think, if i told someone, he might have real doubts, the blockhead! as far as the actual details, printing, paper, and sales, you can leave all that to me! i know all the ins and outs! we’ll start small, grow larger, and at least we’ll be able to feed ourselves; in any case, we’ll break even.” dunya’s eyes shone. “i really like what you’re saying, dmitry prokofich,” she said. “of course, i don’t know anything about this,” pulkheriya aleksandrovna put in. “perhaps it’s a good idea, but then again, god only knows. it’s somehow new and unknown. of course, we have to stay here, at least for some time . . .” she looked at rodya. “what do you think, brother?” asked dunya. “i think he has a very good idea,” he replied. “naturally, it’s too early to dream about a publishing house, but one could publish five or six books with indisputable success. i myself know of one work that will definitely suit. as to whether he knows how to conduct the business, there’s no doubt about that either. . . . however, there’s still time for you to reach an agreement . . .” “hurrah!” cried razumikhin. “now, wait: there’s an apartment here, in this building, from the same landlords. it’s separate, on its own, and doesn’t connect with any other rooms; it’s three small furnished rooms, and the rent is modest. take it for the time being. i’ll pawn the watch for you tomorrow and bring you the money; the rest will all be arranged later. the main thing is, all three of you can live here together, both of you and rodya. . . . but where are you going, rodya?” “what, rodya, are you leaving already?” pulkheriya aleksandrovna asked with some alarm. “at a time like this?” cried razumikhin. dunya looked at her brother with distrustful astonishment. he was holding his cap, preparing to leave. “it seems as if you’re burying me or saying farewell forever,” he said in a somewhat strange manner. he seemed to smile, but it wasn’t quite a real smile. “who knows, perhaps we really are seeing each other for the last time,” he added unexpectedly. he thought he was muttering to himself, but somehow it was uttered aloud. “what’s the matter with you?” cried his mother. “where are you going, rodya?” dunya asked somehow peculiarly. “just so, i have to,” he replied vaguely, as if hesitating in what he really wanted to say. but his pale face showed a kind of firm resolution. “i wanted to say . . . as i was coming here . . . i wanted to tell you, mama . . . and you, dunya, that it would be better for us to separate for some time. i don’t feel well; i’m not at peace. . . . i’ll come later, on my own, when . . . it’ll be possible. i remember you and love you. . . . let me be! leave me alone! i decided this a while ago. . . . i’ve decided this for certain. . . . whatever happens to me, whether i perish or not, i want to be alone. forget all about me. . . . it’s better that way. . . . don’t inquire about me. when necessary, i’ll come myself or . . . i’ll summon you. perhaps everything will resurrect! but now, while you love me, give me up. . . . or else, i feel that i’ll get to hate you. . . . farewell!” “good lord!” cried pulkheriya aleksandrovna. both his mother and his sister were terribly frightened; razumikhin, too. “rodya, rodya! make peace with us and let’s go back to how we were before!” cried his poor mother. he turned slowly to the door and slowly started to leave the room. dunya caught up with him. “brother! what are you doing to our mother?” she whispered, her eyes burning with indignation. he looked at her gravely. “it’s all right, i’ll come, i will!” he muttered in a low voice, as if not fully aware of what he was saying, and walked out of the room. “what an insensitive, spiteful egoist!” cried dunya. “he’s in-sane, not in-sensitive! he’s mad! don’t you see that? you’re the insensitive one,” razumikhin whispered heatedly into her ear while keeping a tight hold on her hand. “i’ll be back right away!” he cried, turning to pulkheriya aleksandrovna, who was mortified, and ran out of the room. raskolnikov was waiting for him at the end of the corridor. “i knew that you’d come running out,” he said. “go back to them and stay with them. . . . stay with them tomorrow and . . . always. i . . . perhaps, i’ll come . . . if possible."
dostoevsky,"farewell!” and, without extending his hand, he left him. “where are you going? what is it? what’s the matter? how can you do this?” razumikhin muttered, completely at a loss. raskolnikov paused once again. “once and for all: don’t ever ask me about anything. there’s nothing i can tell you. . . . don’t come to see me. perhaps i’ll come here. . . . leave me, but don’t . . . leave them . do you understand?” it was dark in the corridor; they were standing near a light. for a minute they stared at each other in silence. razumikhin would remember this moment for the rest of his life. raskolnikov’s intense and burning gaze seemed to grow stronger with every moment, penetrating his soul and his consciousness. all of a sudden, razumikhin shuddered. it was as if something strange passed between them. . . . an idea crept in, something like a hint; something horrible, hideous, and immediately understood on both sides. . . . razumikhin turned as pale as a corpse. “do you understand now?” raskolnikov said suddenly, his face painfully distorted. “go back, be with them,” he added abruptly; turning swiftly, he left the building. i won’t describe now what happened that evening with pulkheriya aleksandrovna, how razumikhin went back to them, how he tried to calm them down, how he swore that it was necessary to allow rodya to rest from his illness, swore that rodya would certainly come to see them, how he would come every day, that rodya was very, very upset, and that it was important not to irritate him; how he, razumikhin, would look after him, find him a good doctor, the best, arrange for a consultation. . . . in a word, from that evening on, razumikhin became like a son and a brother to them. oceanofpdf.com iv r askolnikov proceeded directly to the house on the canal where sonya lived. it was an old, three-story green house. he looked for the caretaker and received vague directions for where to find the tailor kapernaumov. after locating the entrance to a narrow, dark staircase in a corner of the courtyard, he finally climbed up to the second floor and emerged into a large hall surrounding it from the side of the courtyard. while he wandered in the darkness and confusion, trying to find the entrance to the kapernaumovs’, suddenly, three steps away from him, a door opened; he grabbed it automatically. “who’s there?” a woman’s voice asked in alarm. “it’s me . . . coming to see you,” replied raskolnikov, and he entered a tiny hall. there, on a broken chair, in a twisted copper candlestick, stood a candle. “it’s you! good lord!” cried sonya weakly, standing there as if rooted to the spot. “which way to your room? this way?” trying not to look at her, raskolnikov proceeded quickly into her room. a minute later sonya entered with a candle, put it down, and stood in front of him, completely at a loss, in inexpressible agitation, apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. all of a sudden her pale face became flushed and tears even appeared in her eyes. . . . she felt sick and ashamed and pleased all at once. . . . raskolnikov turned around quickly and sat down on the chair next to the table. in one fleeting glance he managed to take in the entire room. it was a large room, but with an extremely low ceiling, the only room rented out by the kapernaumovs, whose apartment was located behind the wall to the left behind a locked door. on the opposite side, in the wall to the right, there was another door, always locked tight. it led to a neighboring apartment with a different number. sonya’s room seemed to resemble a barn; it had an irregular quadrilateral shape that suggested something deformed. a wall with three windows facing out on the canal cut through the room at a slant; as a result, one corner, terribly acute, trailed off into the distance so that in dim light it was impossible to make out anything very well; the other corner was too hideously obtuse. there was almost no furniture at all in this large room. in a corner on the right was a bed; near the door leading into the other apartment stood a simple wooden table covered in a blue tablecloth; two cane chairs were next to the table. then, on the opposite wall, closest to the narrow corner, stood a small, simple wooden chest of drawers, as if lost in empty space. that was everything in the room. yellowish, dirty, worn wallpaper was blackened in all the corners; it must have been damp and smoky during the winter. the inhabitant’s poverty was obvious; there weren’t even any curtains in front of the bed. sonya silently regarded her guest, who was so carefully and unceremoniously examining her room; ultimately she even began trembling in fear, as if she were standing in front of a judge and the ruler of her fate. “i’ve come late. . . . is it eleven o’clock yet?” he asked, still not raising his eyes to her face. “it is,” she muttered. “it is, yes!” she hastened to add suddenly, as if it was some sort of escape for her. “the landlord’s clock just chimed . . . and i heard it myself. . . . it is.” “i’ve come to see you for the last time,” raskolnikov continued gloomily, even though this was only his first visit. “i may not see you again . . .” “are you . . . going away?” “i don’t know. . . . tomorrow it’ll all . . .” “so you won’t be at katerina ivanovna’s tomorrow?” sonya asked, her voice trembling. “i don’t know. tomorrow morning it’ll all be. . . . that’s not the point: i came to tell you one thing . . .” he raised his brooding glance to her face"
dostoevsky,"and suddenly noticed that he was sitting, while she was still standing in front of him. “why are you standing there? sit down,” he said suddenly, but in an altered, soft, and polite voice. she sat down. he looked at her warmly, almost with compassion. “you’re so thin! just look at your hand! it’s completely transparent. your fingers are like a dead person’s.” he took her hand. sonya smiled weakly. “i’ve always been like that,” she said. “even when you were living at home?” “yes.” “well, of course!” he uttered abruptly, and both the expression on his face and the sound of his voice suddenly changed again. he glanced around the room again. “you rent this from the kapernaumovs?” “yes, sir . . .” “do they live there, behind that door?” “yes. . . . they have a room just like this.” “all together in one room?” “yes, sir.” “i’d be afraid to be in your room at night,” he observed glumly. “the landlords are very kind, very polite,” replied sonya, seeming not yet to have come to her senses or to be understanding properly. “all the furniture and everything else . . . all belongs to the landlords. they’re very nice people, and the children often come to see me . . .” “do they stutter?” “yes, sir. he does and he’s also lame. his wife, too. . . . it’s not that she stutters, but she can’t pronounce her words clearly. she’s a good woman, very kind. he’s a former house serf. they have seven children . . . and only the eldest stutters; the others are simply unwell . . . but they don’t stutter. . . . how do you know about them?” she added in some surprise. “your father told me all about them. he told me all about you. . . . how you left at six o’clock and came back at nine, and how katerina ivanovna fell to her knees next to your bed.” sonya was embarrassed. “it’s as if i saw him today,” she whispered hesitantly. “who?” “my father. i was walking along the street, just nearby here, on the corner, after nine o’clock, and it was as if he was ahead of me. it looked just like him. i wanted to call on katerina ivanovna . . .” “you were out walking the streets?” “yes,” sonya whispered abruptly, once again embarrassed and dropping her eyes. “did katerina ivanovna ever beat you when you were at your father’s place?” “oh, no, what are you saying? why do you say that? no!” sonya said, looking at him, even in fear. “so, do you love her?” “her? of course, i do!” sonya wailed pitifully, suddenly crossing her arms in suffering. “ah! you don’t. . . . if you only knew. she’s just like a child. . . . she’s almost lost her mind . . . from grief. she used to be so clever . . . so generous . . . so kind! you don’t know anything, not a thing . . . ah!” sonya said all this as if she were in despair, agitated and suffering, wringing her hands. her pale cheeks flushed once more, and her eyes expressed her torment. it was apparent that she was deeply moved, that she very much wanted to express something, to say something, to defend katerina. some kind of insatiable compassion, if it’s possible to express it like that, was suddenly reflected in all the features of her face. “beat me! what on earth are you saying? good lord, beat me! even if she had beaten me, what of it? so, what of it? you don’t know anything, not a thing. . . . she’s such an unhappy woman, ah, so unhappy! and sickly. . . . she’s looking for justice. . . . she’s pure. she believes steadfastly that justice must exist, and she demands it. . . . even if you tormented her, she’d never do anything unjust. she herself doesn’t realize that it’s impossible to find justice among people, and she gets irritated. . . . she’s like a child, a child! she’s just, very just!” “what will happen to you?” sonya regarded him questioningly. “they’re on your hands, you know. true, they depended on you before, and your late father would ask you for money so he could drink to cure his hangover. well, what will happen now?” “i don’t know,” sonya said glumly. “will they stay there?” “i don’t know. they’re in debt for that apartment; i hear that the landlady just served them notice, but katerina ivanovna says that she herself doesn’t want to stay there a moment longer.” “why’s she being so brave? is she relying on you?” “oh, no, don’t talk like that! we live in complete harmony,” sonya said, suddenly agitated again and even irritated, just as if a canary or some other little bird had gotten angry. “what on earth can she do? what else can she do?” she asked, growing heated and upset. “she wept and wept so much today! she’s going mad, didn’t you notice that? she’s so muddled; she’s either agitated like a little girl, hoping that tomorrow everything will be right, the refreshments, and everything else . . . or she wrings her hands, coughs up blood, weeps, and suddenly begins banging her head against the wall, as if in despair. then she calms down again; she’s relying entirely on you: she says that now you’re her helpmate. she’ll borrow some money from somewhere and go back to her town with me, and she’ll open a boarding school for noble young women; she’ll take me on as a supervisor and we’ll start a splendid new life; she kisses me, hugs me, comforts me, and believes all this! she believes in these fantasies! well, do i dare contradict her? meanwhile, she herself washes, cleans, mends, and with her feeble strength drags the washtub into the room, panting, and then has to fall"
dostoevsky,"into bed; this morning she and i went to the market stalls to buy some shoes for polechka and lenya, because theirs were all worn out, but we didn’t have enough money to pay for them, not nearly enough, and she’d chosen such sweet little shoes, because she has good taste, you just don’t know. . . . she started crying right there in the shop in front of the merchants, because we didn’t have enough money. . . . ah, it was pitiful to see.” “well, after that one can understand how you . . . live like this,” raskolnikov said with a bitter smile. “don’t you feel sorry for her? don’t you?” sonya grew angry again. “i know that you gave her your last kopecks before you’d seen anything. if you’d seen it all, oh, good lord! i’ve driven her to tears so often, so very often! even as recently as last week! oh, yes, me! just one week before his death. i acted cruelly! i’ve done that so many times, so many. ah, it’s so painful to remember this now all day long.” sonya even wrung her hands as she spoke, recalling the pain. “you mean to say you’re cruel?” “yes, me, me! i went there,” she continued, weeping, “and my late father said, ‘read to me, sonya,’ he says, ‘my head aches. read to me . . . here’s the book.’ it was some book he had; he’d gotten it from andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov, who lives there; he used to get such funny books. and i said, ‘i have to leave,’ because i didn’t want to read; i’d stopped by mainly to show some collars to katerina ivanovna. lizaveta, the market woman, had sold me some collars and cuffs cheaply, very nice ones, new, with a pattern. katerina ivanovna liked them very much; she put one on and looked at herself in the mirror. she really, really liked them. ‘give them to me as a present, sonya,’ she says, ‘please.’ she said ‘please,’ she wanted them so much. but where would she wear them? they just reminded her of the good old days! she looked at herself in the mirror, admired them, but she had no dresses, none at all, no pretty things for so many years! she never asked anyone for anything; she’s proud; she’d sooner give away her last coin, and here she was asking for something—she liked them so much! but i didn’t want to give them to her. ‘what do you need them for, katerina ivanovna?’ i said. ‘what for?’ that’s what i said. i shouldn’t have said that to her! she looked at me and was so very sad that i’d refused; it was pitiful to see. . . . she wasn’t sad about the collars, i realized, but because i’d refused her. ah, if i could change it all, do it all again, all those words i said. . . . oh, me . . . but what am i saying? it doesn’t make any difference!” “did you know lizaveta, the market woman?” “yes. . . . did you know her, too?” asked sonya with some surprise. “katerina ivanovna has consumption, a bad case; she’ll die soon,” said raskolnikov, falling silent and not answering sonya’s question. “oh, no, no, no!” sonya unconsciously seized both his hands, as if begging him not to let it happen. “after all, it’ll be better if she does.” “no, not better, not at all, not better at all!” she repeated anxiously and unconsciously. “and the children? what will you do with them, if you don’t take them in yourself?” “oh, i don’t know!” cried sonya almost in despair, and she clutched her head. it was apparent that this thought had already occurred to her many times before and that he had reminded her of it once again. “well, what if, while still living with katerina ivanovna, you fall ill now and they take you to a hospital, then what will happen?” he insisted pitilessly. “ah, what are you saying, why say that? that can’t possibly happen!” sonya’s face was distorted with horrible fear. “why can’t it happen?” continued raskolnikov with a cruel smirk. “you’re not insured, are you? then what will happen to them? the whole bunch will be driven out into the street; she’ll cough and beg, bang her head against the wall somewhere, just like she did today, and the children will cry. . . . she’ll fall down, be taken to the police, to the hospital, and she’ll die, while the children . . .” “oh, no! god won’t allow that!” the words burst forth at last from sonya’s constricted chest. she was listening, looking at him imploringly and folding her hands in mute supplication, as if everything depended on him. raskolnikov stood up and began walking around the room. about a minute passed. sonya stood there, her hands and head lowered, in terrible distress. “can’t you save up? put some money away for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping suddenly in front of her. “no,” whispered sonya. “of course not! but have you tried?” he added, almost with derision. “i have.” “and it fell through! well, of course, it did. why even ask?” he walked around the room again. another minute passed. “don’t you earn some money every day?” sonya was more embarrassed than before; her face flushed with color once again. “no,” she whispered with tormented effort. “polechka will probably wind up the same way,” he said suddenly. “no! no! it can’t be, no!” sonya cried loudly, as if in despair, as if someone had stabbed her with a knife. “god, god won’t allow such a terrible thing!” “he lets it happen to other people.” “no, no! god will protect her, he will!” she repeated, beside herself. “perhaps there’s no such thing as god,” raskolnikov replied, even with some malicious delight. he began laughing and glanced at her. sonya’s face suddenly changed terribly: a shudder ran across it. she glanced"
dostoevsky,"at him with inexpressible reproach, wanted to say something, but couldn’t utter a word. all of a sudden, she just started weeping bitterly, covering her face with her hands. “you say that katerina ivanovna’s mind is muddled; your mind is muddled, too,” he said after some silence. about five minutes passed. he kept pacing the room in silence, without glancing at her. at last he went up to her; his eyes were shining. he put his hands on her shoulders and looked into her weeping face. his gaze was dry, inflamed, and sharp; his lips were trembling violently. . . . all at once, he bowed down quickly and, falling to the floor, kissed her foot. sonya took a step back from him in fear, as if from a madman. and, in fact, he looked completely mad. “what’s this? what are you doing? to me?” she muttered, turning pale; her heart suddenly ached in agony. “i didn’t bow down to you; i bowed down to all human suffering,” he uttered madly and went over to the window. “listen,” he added, returning to her a minute later. “a little while ago, i said to an offensive fellow that he wasn’t worth even your little finger . . . and that i did my sister an honor today when i sat her next to you.” “ah, why did you tell them that? in her presence?” cried sonya in alarm. “to sit with me? an honor? but i have no honor. . . . i’m a great, great sinner! ah, why did you say that?” “i said it about you not because of your dishonor and your sin, but because of your great suffering. as for your being a great sinner, that’s true,” he added almost enthusiastically. “worst of all is that you’re a sinner who’s destroyed and betrayed herself in vain . isn’t it really terrible! isn’t it terrible that you live in this filth that you despise and, at the same time, you yourself know (all you have to do is open your eyes) that you’re not helping anyone and not saving anyone from anything! tell me once and for all,” he said, almost in a frenzy, “how this disgrace and this baseness can be combined in you together with other contradictory and sacred feelings? why, it would be more just, a thousand times more just and more reasonable to plunge your head into the water and end it all at once!” “and what will become of them?” sonya asked weakly, glancing at him full of suffering, but at the same time not at all surprised by his suggestion. raskolnikov regarded her strangely. he was able to understand everything in that one look. apparently, this idea must have occurred to her already. perhaps she had even seriously considered many times in her despair how to end it all, so seriously that his suggestion almost didn’t surprise her. she didn’t even notice the cruelty of his words (of course, she also didn’t notice the meaning of his reproaches and of his peculiar view of her disgrace, and this was obvious to him). but he understood completely how monstrously she was tormented, and had been for some time, by the thought of her dishonorable and shameful predicament. what, what on earth could possibly, he wondered, have impeded her resolve up to this point to end it all at once? and only then did he completely understand the meaning these poor little orphan children had for her, and the pitiful half-mad katerina ivanovna, with her consumption and her banging her head against the wall. yet it was clear to him once again that sonya, with her character and the upbringing she had nonetheless received, could in no way stay as she was. still the question remained for him: how could she have stayed in her present situation for so long and not lost her mind, if she wasn’t strong enough to throw herself into the water? of course, he understood that sonya’s position in society was accidental, although, unfortunately, not singular and not exceptional. but this very chance, this smattering of education, and all her previous life could have destroyed her at her very first step on this abominable path. what had supported her? it wasn’t the depravity. why, this disgrace, obviously, had affected her only mechanically; not one drop of genuine disgrace had yet penetrated into her heart: he saw this; she stood before him in reality . . . “she has three ways she can go,” he thought. “she can throw herself into the canal, wind up in a madhouse, or . . . or, in the end, immerse herself in depravity, stupefying her mind and hardening her heart.” this last thought was the most repulsive of all; but he was already skeptical; he was young, philosophical, and therefore cruel. as a result, he couldn’t help believing that the last escape, that is, depravity, was the most probable of all. “but is that really the truth?” he cried to himself. “is it really possible that this creature, who still preserves her purity of spirit, will consciously be drawn in the end into that filthy, stinking pit? hasn’t that process already begun, and isn’t it only because she’s managed to resist up to now that vice no longer seems so repulsive to her? no, no, that can’t possibly be!” he cried, as sonya had before. “no, up to this point the thought of sin kept her from the canal, and the thought of them, the children . . . . and if she hasn’t lost her mind up to now? but who’s to say that she hasn’t already lost her mind? is she really in her right mind? can one really talk the way she does? can one reason the way she does in one’s right mind? can she stand over her own ruin, directly above that stinking pit into which she’s being drawn, and can she wave her arms and block her"
dostoevsky,"ears when she’s being told about the danger? is it that she’s waiting for a miracle? she must be. aren’t these all signs of madness?” he paused stubbornly on this thought. he even liked this way out more than any other. he began staring at her more intensely. “so, do you pray to god a great deal, sonya?” he asked her. sonya was silent; he stood next to her and waited for an answer. “what would i be without god?” she whispered rapidly, energetically, quickly glancing at him with her sparkling eyes and firmly grasping his hand in her own. “just as i thought!” he said to himself. “and what does god do for you in return?” he asked, inquiring further. sonya was silent for a long time, as if she could make no reply. her weak chest heaved in agitation. “be quiet! don’t ask! you’re not worthy!” she cried suddenly, looking at him sternly and angrily. “just as i thought! just as i thought!” he repeated persistently to himself. “he does everything!” she whispered hurriedly, dropping her eyes again. “that’s a way out! that’s the explanation of her way out!” he decided, regarding her with greedy curiosity. with a strange, new, almost painful feeling, he looked into her pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, her meek blue eyes, which could shine with such fire, such severe strong emotion, at her small body, still trembling from indignation and rage, and all of this seemed stranger and stranger to him, almost impossible. “a holy fool! she’s a holy fool!” he repeated to himself. * a book lay on her dresser. he had noticed it each time he’d walked past it; now he picked it up and looked at it. it was a russian translation of the new testament. it was an old book, worn, bound in leather. “where’s this from?” he shouted to her from across the room. she stood in the same place, three paces away from the table. “it was given to me,” she replied, as if reluctantly and without looking at him. “by whom?” “lizaveta gave it to me; i asked her for it.” “lizaveta! strange!” he thought. everything about sonya seemed somehow stranger and more astounding with each passing minute. he brought the book nearer to the candle and began thumbing through its pages. “where does it talk about lazarus?” he asked suddenly. sonya stared stubbornly at the floor and made no reply. she stood with her side facing the table. “where’s the raising of lazarus? † find it for me, sonya.” she cast a sidelong glance at him. “it’s not where you’re looking. . . . it’s in the fourth gospel,” she whispered sternly, not approaching him. “find it and read it to me,” he said. he sat down, placed his elbows on the table, rested his head on one hand, and stared gloomily to one side, preparing to listen. “in a few weeks they’ll be welcoming her to a madhouse! i may wind up there, too, if something worse doesn’t happen,” he muttered to himself. upon hearing raskolnikov’s strange request with distrust, sonya moved hesitantly to the table. but she picked up the book. “haven’t you read it before?” she asked, looking at him distrustfully across the table. her voice was becoming more and more severe. “a long time ago. . . . when i was at school. read it!” “haven’t you heard it in church?” “i . . . don’t go to church. do you go often?” “n-no,” sonya whispered. raskolnikov smirked. “i see. . . . and, of course, tomorrow you won’t go to your father’s funeral?” “i will. i was at church last week, too . . . to have a requiem sung.” “for whom?” “for lizaveta. she was killed with an axe.” his nerves grew more and more irritated. his head began spinning. “were you friendly with lizaveta?” “she . . . she was very fair. . . . she came here . . . not often. . . . it wasn’t possible. we used to read together . . . and chat. she will see god.” these bookish words sounded strange to him, and once again it was something new: some sort of mysterious meetings with lizaveta, both of them—holy fools. “i myself will become one here! it’s contagious!” he thought. “read!” he cried insistently and irritably all of a sudden. sonya was still hesitating. her heart was pounding. for some reason, she didn’t dare read to him. he looked at this “unhappy deranged woman” almost with torment. “why should i read to you? you don’t even believe,” she whispered quietly, almost gasping for breath. “read! i want you to!” he insisted. “you used to read to lizaveta!” sonya turned the pages of the book and searched for the place. her hands were trembling, and her voice failed. twice she tried to read but was unable to utter even the first word. “ ‘now a certain man was sick, named lazarus, of bethany . . .’ ” she said at last, with effort, but all of a sudden, from the third word her voice began to vibrate and break off, like a string stretched too tight. her breath failed her, and her chest tightened. raskolnikov understood in part why sonya had refused to read to him, and the more he understood that, the more abusively and irritably he insisted on her reading. he understood all too well how painful it was for her to expose and betray all that was her own . he realized that these feelings seemed perhaps to constitute her genuine and cherished secret, perhaps from her own girlhood, when she was living with her family, with her unfortunate father and her stepmother, demented by grief, among hungry children, hideous cries, and reproaches. but at the same time, he now knew, and knew for certain, that even though she grieved and feared something terrible as she now set about reading, she also felt a tormenting desire to"
dostoevsky,"read, in spite of her grief and all the dangers, and to read just to him, so that he heard, and precisely now —“whatever happened afterward!” he could read this in her eyes, he could understand it in her emotional distress. . . . she gained control of herself, suppressed the throat spasms that had broken her voice at the beginning of the verse; then she continued reading the eleventh chapter of the gospel of john. thus she reached the nineteenth verse: “ ‘and many of the jews came to martha and mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. then martha, as soon as she heard that jesus was coming, went and met him: but mary sat still in the house. then said martha unto jesus, lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. but i know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of god, god will give it thee.’ ” here she paused again, sensing shamefully that her voice would falter and break off once more . . . “ ‘jesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise again. martha saith unto him, i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. jesus saith unto her, i am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. believest thou this? she saith unto him—’ ” (and, seeming to draw her breath with pain, sonya read clearly and compellingly, as if she herself was confessing for all to hear:) “ ‘yea, lord: i believe that thou art the christ, the son of god, which should come into the world.’ ” she was about to pause and glance quickly up at him, but soon gained control of herself and began reading again. raskolnikov sat and listened without moving, without turning, his elbows on the table, looking to one side. they read up to verse thirty-two. “ ‘then when mary was come where jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, and saying unto him, lord if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. when jesus therefore saw her weeping, the jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, and said, where have ye laid him? they say unto him, lord, come and see. jesus wept. then said the jews, behold how he loved him! and some of them said, could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?’ ” raskolnikov turned to her and looked at her with agitation: yes, that was it! she was already trembling in real, genuine fever. he had been expecting this. she was nearing the words of the greatest and most unprecedented miracle, and a feeling of immense triumph took hold of her. her voice became as clear as a bell; triumph and joy resounded in it and strengthened it. the lines became confused in front of her because things darkened in her eyes, but she knew the passage by heart. at the last verse, “could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind,” she lowered her voice, conveying passionately and heatedly the doubt, reproach, and censure of the unbelieving, unseeing jews, who very soon, a moment later, as if struck by thunder, would fall down, begin weeping, and believe. . . . “and he, he —also unseeing and unbelieving—he, too, would hear at once, and he, too, would believe. yes, yes! right now, immediately,” she dreamed and trembled in ecstatic expectation. “ ‘jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. it was a cave and a stone lay upon it. jesus said, take ye away the stone. martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, lord, by this time he stinketh: for he has been dead four days.’ ” she energetically emphasized the word: four. “ ‘jesus saith unto her, said i not unto thee, that if thou wouldst believe, then thou shouldst see the glory of god? then they took away the stone from that place where the dead was laid. and jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, father, i thank thee that thou hast heard me. and i knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by i said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. and when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, lazarus, come forth. and he that was dead came forth—’ ” (she read in a loud and ecstatic voice, trembling and growing cold, as if she had seen it with her own eyes:) “ ‘—bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. jesus saith unto them, loose him and let him go. “ ‘ then many of the jews which came to mary, and had seen the things which jesus did, believed on him.’ ” she didn’t read any further, nor could she; she closed the book and stood up quickly from her chair. “that’s all there is about the resurrection of lazarus,” she whispered abruptly and sternly; she remained motionless, turned to one side, not daring, as if ashamed, to raise her eyes and look at him. her feverish trembling continued. the candle stub had long since burned down in the twisted candleholder, dimly illuminating in this impoverished room the murderer and the prostitute, strangely united for the reading of the eternal book. five or more minutes passed. “i came to tell you something,” raskolnikov said all of sudden in a loud voice and with a frown; he stood up and went over to sonya. she silently raised her eyes and looked at him. his glance was especially stern, expressing some fierce resoluteness. “today i deserted my family,” he said, “my mother and my sister. i won’t go to"
dostoevsky,"see them now. i have broken off with them completely.” “why?” asked sonya in astonishment. the recent meeting with his mother and sister had made an extraordinary impression on her, although it was still unclear to her why. she heard this news of the rupture almost in horror. “now i have only you,” he added. “we’ll go together. . . . i’ve come to you. we’re both damned. we’ll go together!” his eyes were shining. “he seems half mad!” sonya thought in her turn. “go where?” she asked in fear, unintentionally taking a step back. “how should i know? i know only that it’s along one road; that i know for certain—and only that. one goal!” she looked at him, not understanding a thing. she understood only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy. “not one of them will understand anything, if you tell them,” he continued, “but i understood. i need you; that’s why i came to see you.” “i don’t understand,” whispered sonya. “you’ll understand later. haven’t you done the same thing? you’ve also stepped over . . . you were able to do it. you laid hands on yourself, you destroyed your own life. (it’s all the same!) you could have lived by reason and spirit, but you’ll end up on the haymarket. . . . but you can’t endure it, and if you remain alone, you’ll lose your mind, just as i will. even now you’re like someone deranged; therefore, we’ll go together, along the same road! let’s go!” “why? why are you saying this?” said sonya, strangely and passionately agitated by his words. “why? because you can’t remain like this—that’s why! you must finally judge things seriously and directly, and not weep and yell like a child that god won’t allow it! what will happen if you get taken away to a hospital tomorrow? katerina ivanovna’s not in her right mind and she has consumption; she’ll die soon; then what will happen to the children? won’t polechka be ruined? haven’t you seen children here, on street corners, whose mothers send them out to beg for charity? i’ve found out where these mothers live and in what circumstances. there it’s impossible for children to stay children. a seven-year-old child is depraved and a thief. but children are the image of christ: ‘for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’ he commanded us to cherish them and to love them; they’re the future of humanity . . .” “what, then, what must we do?” sonya repeated, crying hysterically and wringing her hands. “what must we do? destroy what’s necessary, once and for all, that’s all: and take the suffering upon us! what? you don’t understand? you will later. . . . freedom and power, and power’s the main thing! over all trembling creatures and over the entire anthill! . . . that’s the goal! remember this! those are my parting words to you! this may be the last time i speak with you. if i don’t come tomorrow, you will hear about it all yourself and then remember these words i’m saying to you now. and sometime, afterward, in a few years, after you’ve lived a while, perhaps you’ll come to understand what they meant. but if i come tomorrow, i’ll tell you who killed lizaveta. farewell!” sonya began trembling in fright. “do you really know who killed her?” she asked, turning cold in horror and regarding him wildly. “i know and i’ll tell. . . . you, and you alone! i’ve chosen you. i won’t come to ask your forgiveness, i’ll simply tell you. a while ago i chose you to tell; back when your father spoke about you and when lizaveta was alive, i thought of this. farewell. don’t give me your hand. tomorrow!” he left. sonya looked at him, as he walked away, as if he were mad; but she herself was like a madwoman, and she realized it. her head was spinning. “lord! how does he know who killed lizaveta? what did those words mean? this is terrible!” but at the same time the thought did not occur to her. by no means! not at all! “oh, he must be terribly unhappy! he deserted his mother and sister. why? what happened? and what does he intend to do?” what had he said to her? he had kissed her foot and said . . . said (yes, he’d said it clearly) that he couldn’t live without her any longer. . . . “oh, good lord!” sonya spent the whole night in a fever and delirium. at times she would jump up, weep, wring her hands, and then fall back into a feverish sleep; she dreamt of polechka, katerina ivanovna, lizaveta, reading the gospel, and of him . . . him, with his pale face and shining eyes. . . . he would kiss her feet and cry. . . . “oh, lord!” behind the door on the right, the door that separated sonya’s apartment from gertruda karlovna resslikh’s, there was an intervening room, long since empty, belonging to madame resslikh’s apartment, and rented out by her; notices to that effect had been placed on gates and announcements stuck to windows overlooking the canal. for a long time, sonya had grown accustomed to thinking the room was uninhabited. meanwhile, all this time, mr. svidrigaylov had been standing hidden behind the door in the empty room, and eavesdropping. when raskolnikov left, he stood there, thought for a while, returned on tiptoe to his own room, which was next to the empty room, got a chair, and silently brought it up to the door leading into sonya’s room. the conversation struck him as interesting and significant, and he’d enjoyed it very, very much—so much so that he had brought a chair in order that in the future, even tomorrow, for example, he wouldn’t have to subject himself again to the unpleasantness of standing on his feet for a whole hour, but he could make himself more comfortable, so"
dostoevsky,"that he could derive pure enjoyment in all regards. * a yurodivy , or holy fool, was a saintly person or ascetic in the early christian tradition; later, in common usage, the term came to mean a crazy person or a simpleton. † sonya reads from and recites verses from the gospel of john :–. oceanofpdf.com v t he next morning, at precisely eleven o’clock, when raskolnikov entered the department of criminal investigations in the building housing the district police station and asked to be announced to porfiry petrovich, he was somewhat surprised by how long it took for him to be admitted: at least ten minutes passed before he was called. according to his calculations, it seemed, they should have seized upon him at once. meanwhile, he stood in the reception room while people who had no interest in him at all came and went. in the next room, resembling an office, several clerks were busy writing; it was obvious that not one of them had any idea who or what this raskolnikov was. he looked around with a restless, suspicious glance, observing closely: was there a prison guard anywhere near him, or a mysterious gaze from someone designated to keep an eye on him so he wouldn’t leave? but there was nothing of the kind: he saw only office workers engaged in trivial matters, as well as several other people, but nobody there had any need for him, as if he were free to leave and go wherever he wished. raskolnikov became more and more convinced of the idea that if the enigmatic man from yesterday, that apparition who had appeared from out of nowhere, had really seen everything and known everything—would they ever have allowed him to stand there now and wait patiently? and would they have waited for him here until eleven o’clock when he’d decided to come all on his own? it must be either that the man still hadn’t reported anything or . . . or else he, too, simply didn’t know anything and hadn’t seen anything with his own eyes (and how could he have seen anything?); therefore, all that had occurred to him, raskolnikov, yesterday was an apparition, exaggerated by his aggravated and sick imagination. this guess, even as early as yesterday, during his severe anxieties and despair, had begun to strengthen in him. having thought it all through, while preparing for a new struggle, he suddenly felt that he was trembling—indignation even began to seethe in him at the thought that he was trembling in fear before the hated porfiry petrovich. the most terrible thing of all was to have to meet this man once again: he hated him beyond all measure, without limit, and he was even afraid that this hatred would cause him to betray himself. his indignation was so intense that it immediately curtailed his trembling; he prepared to enter with a cold, insolent appearance and promised himself to maintain his silence for as long as he could, to watch carefully and listen attentively, so that this time, at least, no matter what happened, he would conquer his own morbidly agitated nature. at that very moment, he was summoned to see porfiry petrovich. it turned out that this time porfiry petrovich was alone. his office was neither large nor small; a large desk stood in front of a sofa covered with an oilcloth; there was also a bureau, a bookcase in one corner, and several chairs—all official furniture, made of polished yellow wood. in one corner, in the rear wall—or, that is, the partition—there was a closed door: farther on, behind the partition, must have therefore been some other rooms. at raskolnikov’s entrance, porfiry petrovich quickly and quietly closed the door through which he had entered, so that they remained alone. he met his guest, apparently, with the most cheerful and welcoming look; it was only a few minutes later that raskolnikov, by certain indications, noticed his embarrassment, as if he was suddenly unsettled or had been discovered doing something very private and secret. “ah, my dear fellow! here you are . . . in our territory,” began porfiry, extending both hands to him. “well, have a seat, old boy! but perhaps you don’t like to be called ‘dear fellow’ or . . . ‘old boy’ like that tout court ? * please don’t consider it too familiar. . . . sit here, sir, on the sofa.” raskolnikov sat down without taking his eyes off him. “in our territory,” excuses for the familiarity, the french phrase “ tout court, ” and so on and so forth—all characteristic indications. “he extended both his hands to me, yet didn’t give me even one; he withdrew his hand in time,” flashed through his mind suspiciously. they both watched each other, but as soon as their eyes met, they turned away from one another instantly. “i brought you this paper . . . about that watch . . . here it is. is it all right or shall i recopy it?” “what? a paper? yes, yes . . . don’t worry, that’s fine,” said porfiry petrovich, as if hurrying to go somewhere, and only after saying this did he take the paper and glance at it. “yes, it’s fine as is. nothing more’s needed,” he confirmed with the same speed and placed the paper on the table. then, a minute later, already talking about something else, he picked it up from the table and placed it on the bureau. “i believe that yesterday you said you wished to question me . . . officially . . . about my acquaintanceship with . . . the murdered woman?” raskolnikov began again. “why did i insert the word ‘believe’?” flashed through his mind like lightning. “well, and why am i so worried that i inserted that word ‘believe’?” another thought occurred to him immediately, also like lightning. suddenly he felt that his suspiciousness, as a result of one encounter with porfiry, from only a"
dostoevsky,"few words, a few glances, had in one moment already grown into something of monstrous proportions . . . and that this was very dangerous: his nerves were irritated, and his anxiety was increasing. “this is dreadful, simply dreadful! i’ll say too much again.” “yes, yes, yes! don’t worry! there’s no hurry, no hurry at all, sir,” muttered porfiry petrovich, pacing back and forth around the table, but seemingly without any objective, as if hastening first to the window, then to the bureau, then back to the table, first avoiding raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then suddenly stopping in one place and staring directly at him. his small, plump, round figure, like a ball rolling in various directions and bouncing off all the walls, seemed very strange indeed. “we’ll have plenty of time, plenty of time, sir! do you smoke? do you have any cigarettes? here’s one, sir,” he continued, offering his guest a cigarette. “you know, i’m receiving you here, but my apartment’s over there, behind the partition . . . the official one. right now i’m staying in a private apartment for some time. it was necessary to complete some repairs here. it’s almost ready now. . . . you know, an official apartment is a wonderful thing, eh? what do you think?” “yes, a wonderful thing,” replied raskolnikov, regarding him almost with a smirk. “a wonderful thing, a wonderful thing,” repeated porfiry petrovich, as if suddenly beginning to think about something altogether different. “yes, a wonderful thing!” he said, almost shouting at last, suddenly looking directly at raskolnikov and pausing two steps away from him. this foolish incessant repetition that an official apartment is a wonderful thing, its vulgar triviality, was in marked contrast to the earnest, thoughtful, and enigmatic glance he now aimed at his guest. but this inflamed raskolnikov’s spite even further, and he could scarcely refrain from issuing a sarcastic and somewhat careless challenge. “do you know,” he asked abruptly, looking at him almost insolently and, as it were, enjoying his own insolence, “it seems there’s a legal procedure, a legal device—for all possible investigators—to begin at first from afar, with trivialities, or even with something serious, but completely irrelevant, in order to, so to speak, encourage or, to put it more directly, to distract the person being interrogated, to lull his sense of caution, and then, all of a sudden, to hit him over the head in the most unexpected manner with the most fatal and dangerous question—isn’t that so? isn’t this still described reverently in all the textbooks of rules and instructions?” “yes, yes . . . so, you think i went on about the official apartment . . . eh?” while saying this porfiry petrovich squinted, winked; something cheerful and sly crossed his face quickly; the wrinkles on his forehead were smoothed out, his little eyes narrowed, his features slackened, and suddenly he burst into nervous, prolonged laughter, his whole body quaking and quivering, while staring directly at raskolnikov. he, too, began to laugh, forcing himself somewhat; but when porfiry, seeing that he was also laughing, collapsed into such peals of laughter that he almost turned bright red, raskolnikov’s repulsion suddenly overtook his caution: he stopped laughing, frowned, and for a long time stared maliciously at porfiry without taking his eyes off him, all during the time of his long and, as it were, intentionally prolonged fit of laughter. carelessness was, however, obvious on both sides: it turned out that porfiry petrovich seemed to be laughing right in the face of his guest, who was taking this laughter maliciously, and porfiry wasn’t the least bit ashamed of this circumstance. this last fact was very significant for raskolnikov: he realized that a little while ago porfiry petrovich had probably not been ashamed; on the contrary, perhaps he himself, raskolnikov, had fallen into a trap; there was something here that he didn’t know about, some sort of goal; perhaps everything had already been prepared, and now, at any moment, it would be revealed and would ensnare him . . . at once he came straight to the point; he stood up and picked up his cap. “porfiry petrovich,” he began decisively, but with rather clear irritation. “yesterday you declared that you wished me to come here for some sort of interrogation.” (he especially emphasized the word “interrogation.”) “i have come; if you need anything, ask me; if not, then let me go. i have no time; i have things to do. . . . i must attend the funeral of that same civil servant who was trampled by horses, about whom you . . . you also know,” he added, immediately growing angry at his addition and, therefore, feeling even more irritated than before. “i’m fed up with all of this, sir, do you hear, and have been for some time. . . . i became ill partly as a result. . . . in a word”—he was almost shouting, aware that the words about his illness were even more inappropriate—“in a word: please either ask me whatever you want to, or let me go, right now. . . . and if you do question me, then only in the proper form, sir! otherwise, i won’t allow it; therefore, farewell for the time being, since there’s nothing now left for the two of us to talk about.” “good lord! what are you saying? what’s there for me to ask?” clucked porfiry petrovich suddenly, at once altering his tone and his look; he stopped laughing immediately. “please don’t be concerned,” he added, once again racing around the room, suddenly urging raskolnikov to sit down again. “there’s no hurry, there’s plenty of time, sir, and all this is mere nonsense, sir! just the opposite: i’m so glad you finally decided to visit us. . . . i want to receive you as a guest. as for that blasted laughter, rodion romanovich, old boy, will you forgive me? that is your patronymic, isn’t it? i’m a nervous man,"
dostoevsky,"sir, and you really did amuse me with your witty remark; sometimes, i must admit, i start shaking like a piece of rubber, and keep it up for half an hour. . . . i’m easily moved to laughter, sir. with my constitution, i even fear that i might suffer a stroke. won’t you have a seat? please, old boy, or else i’ll think you’re angry . . .” raskolnikov was silent; he listened and observed, still frowning angrily. he did sit down, but he didn’t let go of his cap. “i’ll tell you one thing, rodion romanovich, old boy, about myself, to explain my character, so to speak,” porfiry petrovich continued, still bustling about the room and, as before, avoiding meeting his guest’s eyes. “you know, i’m not married, not sophisticated, and not well known; in addition, i’m all washed up, finished, sir, gone to seed and . . . and . . . and have you noticed, rodion romanovich, that here among us, that is, in russia, sir, especially in our petersburg circles, if two clever men, not yet acquainted with each other but, so to speak, who mutually respect one another, the way you and i do now, sir, if they come together, they spend half an hour without ever finding anything to talk about—they freeze up in front of each other, they sit there and they’re both embarrassed. everyone has something to talk about, ladies, for example . . . or fashionable people, for example, people in high society, there’s always something to talk about, c’est de rigueur, but people in the middle, like us—that is, those who think—we’re always embarrassed and not talkative. . . . why do you think that’s so, old boy? do you think it’s because we have no interest in social matters, or is it that we’re very honest and don’t wish to deceive one another? i don’t know, sir. eh? what do you think? put your cap down, sir, it looks as if you plan to leave at once; really, it’s uncomfortable to see it. . . . on the other hand, i’m so glad, sir . . .” raskolnikov put his cap down, maintained his silence, and listened seriously, with a scowl, to porfiry’s empty, disjointed chatter. “is he really trying to distract me with his foolish chatter?” “i won’t offer you coffee, sir, it’s not the place; but why not sit here with a friend for five minutes or so for some amusement,” porfiry chattered on without stopping, “and you know, sir, all these official obligations . . . don’t be offended, old boy, if i keep pacing back and forth, sir; forgive me, old boy, i’m most afraid to offend you, but exercise is simply essential to me, sir. i sit all the time, and i’m so glad to spend five minutes moving . . . it’s hemorrhoids, sir. . . . i keep meaning to try gymnastics to treat them; they say that state councillors, active state councillors, and even privy councillors, like to jump rope, sir; that’s science for you, in our day and age, sir. . . . yes, sir. . . . and as far as my obligations here, interrogations and all that formality . . . you yourself, old boy, were good enough to mention interrogations, sir . . . well, you know, really, rodion romanovich, old boy, these interrogations sometimes confound the interrogator more than they do the person being interrogated. . . . you just remarked on this, old boy, with complete fairness and wittiness.” (raskolnikov had made no such remark.) “you get mixed up, sir! really, mixed up! and it’s always one and the same thing, one and the same, like beating a drum! so the reform † will take place and at least they’ll call us something different, ha-ha-ha! and as for our legal procedures—as you so wittily expressed it—i’m in complete agreement with you, sir. who, tell me, who out of all the people accused of crimes, even if they’re absolute muzhiks, ‡ who doesn’t know, for example, that at first they begin to lull you with irrelevant questions (in your own fortuitous expression) and then all of a sudden hit you over the head, with an axe, sir, ha-ha-ha, over your head, in your fortuitous phrase, ha-ha! so you really thought i wanted to use the matter of this apartment with you . . . ha-ha! you’re an ironic fellow. no, i won’t do it! ah, by the way, one little word calls up another; one idea summons another. you were good enough to mention form just a little while ago, you know, the forms of the interrogator, sir. . . . why bother with the proper forms? the forms, you know, in many cases, are just nonsense, sir. sometimes, you just chat like friends, and it’s more useful. formality leads nowhere, allow me to reassure you, sir; and what is there in the forms, i ask you? forms mustn’t hamper the interrogator at every step. the business of the interrogator is, so to speak, a kind of freewheeling art, or something of the sort . . . ha-ha-ha!” porfiry petrovich caught his breath for a moment. he had been spurting these empty, meaningless phrases without stop, suddenly dropping in some enigmatic words, then wandering off into nonsense again. he was now almost running around the room, moving his stout little legs faster and faster, looking down at the floor, his right hand thrust behind his back, his left constantly waving about, executing various gestures, each time astonishingly ill-suited to his words. raskolnikov suddenly noticed that, as he ran about the room, he paused a few times, as it were, next to the door for a moment, and seemed to be listening. . . . “is he expecting something?” “but you were really quite correct, sir,” porfiry resumed again, cheerfully, regarding raskolnikov with unusual sincerity (as a result of which raskolnikov even shuddered and promptly prepared"
dostoevsky,"himself), “really correct, sir, when you were so witty at the expense of our legal forms, ha-ha! these profoundly psychological devices of ours (certain of them, of course) are extremely amusing, sir, perhaps even useless, sir, if one is confined by these formalities, sir. yes, sir . . . i’m talking about forms again: well, if i recognize—or, more correctly, suspect—that someone or other has committed a crime, sir, in a case i’ve been assigned. . . . why, you’re studying law, aren’t you, rodion romanovich?” “yes, i was . . .” “well, then here’s a little example for the future—that is, don’t think i’d dare to instruct you: why, just look at those articles on crime you publish! no, sir, it’s just as a fact that i dare present you with a little example—so then, if i, for instance, consider someone guilty of committing a crime, why, i ask you, would i want to alarm him prematurely, even if i had definite evidence against him, sir? for example, i’m obliged to arrest one person sooner, but someone else has a different character, sir; so why shouldn’t i let him gallivant around town, sir, ha-ha! no, i can see you don’t quite understand, so i’ll explain it to you more clearly: for instance, if i were to put him in jail too soon, then i’d be giving him moral support, so to speak, ha-ha! you’re laughing?” (raskolnikov wasn’t even tempted to laugh: he sat there, his teeth clenched, without taking his angry gaze from porfiry petrovich’s eyes). “meanwhile, that’s how it is, especially with some subjects, because people are different, sir, yet there’s only one procedure for all of them, sir. now you’ll say, what about the evidence? well, let’s suppose there is evidence, sir, but evidence, old boy, cuts two ways, for the most part, sir. i’m an investigator and, as a result, i confess that i’m an imperfect man: i’d like to present an investigation that is, so to speak, mathematically clear; i’d like to have evidence that is the equivalent of two times two makes four! it would be direct and incontrovertible proof! but if you lock someone up before it’s time—even if i were convinced that it was him —i might be depriving myself of the means of further exposure, and why? because i’d be giving him a definite position, so to speak, defining him psychologically and reassuring him, and he’d retreat from me into his shell: he’d understand at last that he was being accused of the crime. they say that in sevastopol, right after the battle of the alma, § clever people were terrified that at any moment the enemy would attack with all its might and would soon capture the town; but when they saw that the enemy preferred to stage a regular siege and was digging the first row of trenches, they say that these same clever people rejoiced and felt reassured, sir: if they were going to mount a regular siege, then the affair would drag on for at least two months! you’re laughing again. you don’t believe me? well, of course, you’re right. you’re right, sir, quite right! these are special cases, i agree with you; the example i presented is really a special case, sir! but here’s what you need to keep in mind, my dear rodion romanovich: the average case, sir, the one for which all these legal forms and procedures are devised, and with which they’re intended to cope and are recorded in books, doesn’t really exist at all, for the simple reason that every case, every crime, for example, as soon as it occurs in reality, immediately becomes a completely special case, sir; in fact, it’s like nothing that’s ever happened before, sir. very amusing cases of this kind sometimes occur, sir. if i leave a particular gentleman all alone: if i don’t arrest him and don’t disturb him, but if he knows at every hour and every minute, or at least if he suspects, that i know everything, all there is to know, and that i’m following him day and night, watching him constantly, and if he feels the weight of my conscious suspicion and fear, well then, he’s absolutely certain to lose his head. he himself will come forward of his own accord, sir, and might perhaps do something that, just like two times two makes four, will provide, so to speak, mathematical clarity—that would be very nice, sir. this can happen even with a coarse peasant, all the more so with people of our ilk, a clever contemporary man who’s developed in a certain direction. for this reason, my dear boy, it’s very important to understand the direction of a person’s development. and the nerves, sir, the nerves, you’ve forgotten all about them, sir! these days everyone’s so sick, and frayed, and irritable! and they’re all so full of bile, so very full! and this, in its own way, i can tell you, sir, can be a mine of information! why should i be upset if a person wanders around town unhindered? let him, let him go wherever he pleases for now; i know that he’s my prey and won’t get away from me! where could he run to, ha-ha! abroad, or what? a pole would go abroad, but not him, the more so since i’m following him and have taken precautions. would he run into the depths of the countryside? but peasants live there, genuine, homespun russian peasants; so our contemporary, a developed person, would sooner prefer prison than life with such strangers as our peasants are, ha-ha! but this is all nonsense and beside the point. what does it mean to run away? it’s a formality; it’s not the main thing. this isn’t why he doesn’t run away from me: it’s that he has nowhere to run; he won’t run away psychologically, ha-ha! what a fine little expression that is! he won’t escape from me by the law of nature, even"
dostoevsky,"if there was somewhere to run to. have you seen a moth near a candle? well, just like that he’ll circle, circle around me, like a moth around a flame; his freedom will no longer satisfy him; he’ll start thinking, become confused, leading himself all around; he’ll get tangled up in a net and worry himself to death! even more than that, he’ll present me with some sort of mathematical proof, like two times two—if only i allow him enough time between the acts. . . . and he’ll keep on, keep circling around me, constantly narrowing the radius of his circle—and then—plop! he’ll fly right into my mouth; i’ll swallow him up, sir, and that will be very nice, sir, ha-ha-ha! you don’t believe me?” raskolnikov made no reply; he sat there pale and immobile, staring at porfiry’s face with the same strained attention. “it’s a fine lesson!” he thought, growing cold. “by now it’s not even a game of cat and mouse, as it was yesterday. after all, it isn’t that he’s showing off his strength and prompting me for nothing: he’s much too clever for that! there must be some other motive, but what is it? hey, brother, you’re frightening me with this nonsense and trying to trick me! you don’t have any evidence, and the man i saw yesterday doesn’t really exist! you’re simply trying to confuse me, to annoy me prematurely, and pounce on me when i’m in such a condition, but you’re wrong, you’ll slip and fall! but why, why is he prompting me this way? is he counting on my frayed nerves? no, brother, you’re mistaken, you’ll slip and fall, even if you’ve prepared some surprise. . . . well, now, we’ll see what you’ve come up with.” he braced himself with all his might, preparing for some terrible and unknown catastrophe. at times he felt like hurling himself at porfiry and strangling him on the spot. when he’d first come in, he had been afraid of his own rage. he felt that his mouth was dry, his heart was pounding, and foam was forming on his lips. but he still resolved to remain silent and not utter one word until it was time. he realized that this was the best tactic in his situation because then he wouldn’t say anything he’d regret later; on the contrary, he’d irritate his foe with his silence and perhaps porfiry might even say something he’d come to regret later. at least, that was what he was hoping. “no, i see you don’t believe me, sir; you think i’m playing innocent pranks on you,” porfiry resumed, becoming more and more cheerful, giggling constantly with enjoyment, and beginning to move around the room once again. “and, of course, you’re right, sir. god created me in such a way that i arouse only comic thoughts in other people; i’m a buffoon, sir; but here’s what i can tell you, sir, and i can repeat it again, sir, that you, old boy, rodion romanovich, you should excuse me, just an old man, while you’re still so young, sir, so to speak, in your first youth, and therefore you value human intelligence above all else, according to the custom of all young people. playful wit and abstract conclusions of reason merely tempt you, sir. it’s precisely like the former austrian hofkriegsrath, ¶ for example, as much as i can judge military matters: on paper they defeated napoleon and took him prisoner; they had calculated and figured it all out in their study, but then, you see, general mack went and surrendered with his entire army, hee-hee-hee! i see, old boy, i see, rodion romanovich, that you’re laughing at me, a civilian, for taking my examples from military history. but what’s to be done? it’s a weakness. i love military affairs, and i love reading about all these military communications. . . . clearly i missed my true calling. i really should have served in the military, sir. i might not have become a napoleon, but i might have become a major, sir, hee-hee-hee! well, sir, now, my dear, i’ll tell you the whole truth about this special case, that is: reality and nature, my dear sir, are very important, and they sometimes undercut the most farsighted calculation! hey, listen to an old man, i’m speaking in earnest, rodion romanovich.” (saying this, porfiry petrovich, who was barely thirty-five, suddenly seemed to grow older; even his voice changed, and he seemed more hunched over.) “besides, i’m a very candid man, sir. . . . am i candid or not? what’s your opinion? it seems to me that i’m completely candid: i’m telling you all these things for nothing, and i’m not even asking any reward, hee-hee! well, then, sir, i’ll continue, sir: wit, in my opinion, is a majestic thing, sir; it is, so to speak, the glory of nature and a consolation for life, and what tricks it can sometimes play, so that at times, it seems, it can bewilder even some poor little investigator, who’s distracted by his own fantasy, as always happens, because he’s also only human, sir! human nature comes to the aid of the poor investigator, that’s the point. a young person, carried away by his own wit, ‘overstepping all obstacles’ (as you were pleased to express it in the wittiest and cleverest fashion), never even thinks about this. let’s suppose that he, that is, this man, our special case, sir, this incognito, sir, will lie brilliantly, in the cleverest way; this might seem to be a triumph, and he could enjoy the fruits of his wit, but, all of a sudden, bang, he falls into a faint in the most interesting and scandalous place. let’s suppose it’s an illness, rooms can sometimes be very stuffy, but all the same, sir! nevertheless, it suggests an idea! he lied incomparably well, but he couldn’t rely on his own nature. there it is, the perfidy, sir! another time, distracted by"
dostoevsky,"the playfulness of his wit, he’ll begin to make fun of the man who suspects him; he’ll grow pale, as if on purpose, as if playing a game, but he grows pale in too natural a way, too much like it was the truth, and once again he’s suggested an idea! even if his trick succeeds at first, the investigator will think it over at night, if he’s nobody’s fool. and it’s like that every step of the way, sir! why? he’ll begin to run ahead, butting in where he’s not asked for, he’ll begin talking incessantly about those things he really should keep silent about, he’ll use sly allegories, hee-hee! he himself will come and begin asking questions: why hasn’t he still been arrested? hee-hee-hee! and this can happen with the cleverest fellow, with a psychologist or a writer, sir! human nature’s a mirror, a mirror, sir, the most transparent, sir! look into it and admire, that’s what, sir! why have you turned so pale, rodion romanovich? is it too stuffy in here? shall i open a window?” “please don’t trouble yourself,” cried raskolnikov and suddenly burst out laughing. “please don’t trouble yourself!” porfiry paused opposite him, waited a bit, and then suddenly started laughing himself. raskolnikov stood up from the sofa and abruptly cut short his spasmodic laughter. “porfiry petrovich!” he said in a loud and distinct voice, even though he could barely stand on his trembling legs. “at last i can see clearly that you positively suspect me of the murder of the old woman and her sister lizaveta. i must tell you that, on my part, i’m sick and tired of this matter. if you find that you have the legal right to prosecute me, then do so; if you have the right to arrest me, than do so. but i won’t allow you to laugh in my face and torment me.” all of a sudden his lips began trembling, his eyes shone with rage, and his voice, which had been restrained up to this point, began to rise. “i won’t allow it, sir!” he cried suddenly, banging his fist on the table with all his might. “do you hear me, porfiry petrovich? i won’t allow it!” “good lord! not again!” porfiry petrovich cried, apparently in a real fright. “old boy, rodion romanovich! my dear fellow! friend! what’s the matter with you?” “i won’t allow it!” raskolnikov started shouting again. “quiet down, old boy! they’ll hear you and come in! just think, what will we tell them?” porfiry petrovich whispered in horror, bringing his face right up to raskolnikov’s. “i won’t allow it, i won’t!” raskolnikov repeated automatically, but also suddenly in a low whisper. porfiry quickly turned around and ran to open a window. “i’ll let in some fresh air. you should drink some water, my dear boy, this is an attack, sir!” he rushed to the door to ask for some water, but there in the corner, fortunately, was a carafe. “here, old boy, drink some,” he whispered, rushing to him with the carafe. “it might help . . .” porfiry petrovich’s fright and sympathy seemed so natural that raskolnikov quieted down and began examining him with intense curiosity. he didn’t, however, accept the glass of water. “rodion romanovich! my dear boy! you’ll drive yourself mad this way, i can assure you. ah! have a drink of water! drink at least a little bit!” he managed to force him to take the glass of water in his hand. raskolnikov was automatically about to raise the glass to his lips, but, after coming to his senses, placed the glass on the table with repulsion. “yes, sir, you had a little attack, sir! that way you’ll bring your illness back, my dear boy,” cooed porfiry petrovich with friendly sympathy, although he still looked rather disconcerted. “good lord! how can you take such bad care of yourself? dmitry prokofich came to see me just yesterday—i agree, i agree, i have a nasty, caustic character, but the conclusions he drew from it! good lord! he came yesterday after you did; we had dinner, chatted for a long time, and i merely threw my hands up in astonishment; well, i think . . . ah, you, good lord! did you send him here? but sit down, old boy, take a seat, for christ’s sake!” “no, i didn’t send him! but i knew he came to see you, and i know why he came,” raskolnikov replied sharply. “you knew?” “i did. so what of it?” “it’s just that, rodion romanovich, old boy, i know about your other exploits, too; i know everything, sir! i know that you went to rent an apartment, toward nighttime, when it was growing dark; you began ringing the bell, asking about the blood, and got the workmen and the caretakers all upset. why, i understand your spiritual state, that is, at that time. . . . nevertheless, you’ll simply drive yourself mad like that, so help me god, sir! you’ll make yourself crazy! indignation is seething too violently inside you, sir, noble indignation, sir, from the insults you’ve suffered, first from fate, and then from the police, so you rush around, here and there, to force everyone to speak out, and that way to finish with everything all at once, because you’re fed up with all this nonsense and all these suspicions. isn’t that so? have i guessed your state? but that way you’re upsetting not only yourself but also razumikhin; he’s too good a person for this, as you yourself know. you have your illness, but he has his virtue; your illness can also infect him. . . . i can tell you, old boy, when you calm down. . . . but sit down, old boy, for christ’s sake! please, have a rest; you look terrible; do sit down.” raskolnikov sat down; his trembling was ending, and his entire body felt hot. in deep amazement, he listened intently to the frightened porfiry petrovich,"
dostoevsky,"who seemed affably solicitous of him. but he didn’t trust even one of his words, although he felt some strange inclination to believe him. porfiry’s unexpected words about the apartment completely stunned him. “how can it be that he apparently knows about the apartment?” he suddenly wondered to himself. “and he himself even tells me about it?” “yes, sir, we had a case that was almost the same in our legal practice, sir, a psychological case, a morbid one, sir,” porfiry rattled on, speaking very quickly. “that fellow also tried to cast aspersions on himself as a murderer, sir, and this is how he did it: he invented an extensive hallucination, presented facts, explained circumstances, became muddled, and wound up confusing everyone and everything. and what for? he himself, absolutely unintentionally, was partly the cause of the murder, but only in part, and as soon as he learned that he had given the murderers a pretext for the crime, he became miserable, lost the ability to think clearly, began seeing visions, went completely mad, and even persuaded himself that he was the murderer! finally, the governing senate heard the case, and the unfortunate man was acquitted and provided with care. thanks to the governing senate! oh dear, ay yi yi! so what then, old boy? you can end up with a fever if such impulses happen to irritate your nerves and you go around at night ringing doorbells and asking about blood! i’ve learned all this psychology in my legal practice, sir. in this way a man can sometimes feel inclined to throw himself out a window or jump from a bell tower; the emotion can be very seductive. same for ringing doorbells. . . . it’s an illness, rodion romanovich, an illness! you’ve begun to neglect your illness too much, sir. you ought to consult an experienced doctor, and not that chubby fellow you see! you’re delirious! you’re doing all these things in your delirium!” for a moment, everything seemed to be spinning around raskolnikov. “could he, could he,” flashed through his head, “be lying even now? it’s not possible, not possible!” he kept pushing this thought away, foreseeing to what degree of rage and fury could it drive him, and feeling that he might lose his mind from that rage. “that wasn’t in a delirium; i was completely conscious!” he cried, gathering all the powers of his reason to discern the point of porfiry’s game. “i was conscious, conscious! do you hear?” “yes, i understand you, and i hear you, sir! you also said yesterday that you weren’t delirious, you even insisted on that! i understand, sir, everything you can say! hey! listen to me, rodion romanovich, my good fellow, there’s this circumstance at least. if, as a matter of fact, you really were guilty, or in some way involved with this accursed business, would you be insisting that you weren’t delirious when you did it all and, on the contrary, were in full command of your faculties? and so very insistent, with such obstinacy, especially insistent—could this possibly be so, could it? in my opinion, it is just the opposite. if you really felt something was wrong, then surely it would make sense for you to insist that you were definitely delirious! isn’t that so? well, isn’t it?” there was something crafty contained in this question. raskolnikov recoiled all the way to the back of the sofa, away from porfiry, who was leaning over him, and he stared directly at him in silent perplexity. “and then about mr. razumikhin, that is, whether it was his own idea to come here yesterday to speak on your behalf or was it at your instigation? but you don’t even hide it! you insist that it was at your instigation!” raskolnikov had never insisted on that. a chill ran up and down his spine. “you’re still lying,” he said slowly and weakly, his lips distorted into a sickly smile. “you want to show me once again that you know my whole game, you know all my answers in advance,” he said, feeling that he wasn’t weighing his words as he should. “you want to frighten me . . . or you’re simply laughing at me . . .” he continued staring at him intently while saying this, and once again boundless rage flashed suddenly in his eyes. “you keep lying!” he cried. “you yourself know well that the criminal’s best dodge is to reveal anything that doesn’t have to be hidden insofar as possible. i don’t believe you!” “what a slippery fish you are!” porfiry said with a giggle. “there’s no way to deal with you; you’re suffering from some sort of monomania. so, you don’t believe me? i say that you do believe, you believe me one inch of the way, but i’ll make you believe me the whole way, because i truly like you and sincerely wish you well.” raskolnikov’s lips trembled. “yes, sir, i do wish, sir, and i will tell you definitively, sir,” he continued, gently, amicably, taking raskolnikov by the arm, just above his elbow. “i’ll tell you definitively, sir: take care of your illness. in addition, your family has now come to see you; you should think about them. you should attend to them and cherish them, but all you do is frighten them . . .” “what business is that of yours? how do you know that? why are you so interested? is it that you’re following me and therefore you want me to know that?” “my dear fellow! why, it was from you, from you that i found all this out! you don’t notice that, in your agitated state, you yourself blurt everything out to me and to others. i also found out many interesting details yesterday from mr. razumikhin, dmitry prokofich. no, sir, you interrupted me, but i’ll say that in spite of your suspiciousness, all your wit, you’ve managed to lose your sensible view of things. take, for example, that theme"
dostoevsky,"of the doorbells once again: i, that is, the examining magistrate, wholeheartedly revealed that precious detail to you, that fact. (and it is a fact, sir!) and you don’t see anything in that? why, if i suspected you in the slightest, why would i proceed in that way? on the contrary, i’d first have lulled your suspicions, and not revealed that i already knew that fact; thus, to distract you to the opposite side and then, all of a sudden, to startle you with an axe over your head (borrowing your own expression): ‘what were you doing, sir, in the murdered woman’s apartment at ten in the evening, even closer to eleven? and why were you ringing the doorbell? and why were you asking about the blood? and why did you try to deceive the caretakers and urge them to go to the police lieutenant?’ if i’d had even a drop of suspicion about you, that’s how i should’ve behaved. i should’ve taken a proper statement from you, conducted a search, why perhaps i even should’ve arrested you. . . . if i’ve acted otherwise, then i’m not harboring any suspicions of you! you’ve lost your sensible view of things; i repeat, you don’t see anything, sir!” raskolnikov’s entire body jerked so violently that porfiry petrovich noticed it too well. “you keep lying!” he cried. “i don’t know your aims, but you keep lying. . . . a little while ago you weren’t talking like that, and i can’t be mistaken about that. . . . you’re lying!” “me? lying?” porfiry took up the idea, obviously getting excited but maintaining his most cheerful and mocking look, and, it seems, not troubling himself at all about mr. raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “me? lying? well, and how was i behaving toward you just a little while ago (that is, as the examining magistrate), when i prompted you and offered you all the means for your defense, providing all that psychology: ‘illness,’ i said, ‘delirium, insults; melancholy and policemen,’ and all the rest? eh? hee-hee-hee! although i’ll say, by the way, that all of these psychological means for defense, these excuses and evasions, are extremely unsupported, and they cut both ways: ‘illness,’ you said, ‘delirium, daydreams, fantasies, i don’t recall,’ all that may be so, sir, but why is it, old boy, that you see precisely these daydreams in your illness or your delirium, and not others? after all, could there have been other ones, sir? isn’t that so? hee-hee-hee-hee!” raskolnikov looked at him with pride and contempt. “in a word,” he said in a loud, insistent voice, standing up and pushing porfiry away slightly as he stood, “in a word, i want to know: do you acknowledge that i’m completely free of suspicion or not ? tell me, porfiry petrovich, tell me once and for all, definitively and quickly, immediately!” “what a task! what a task you’re setting,” cried porfiry with an absolutely cheerful, crafty, and completely untroubled look. “why do you want to know, why do you want to know so much if no one’s even started pestering you yet? you’re like a little child: asking to play with fire! why are you so worried? why do you thrust yourself upon us, for what reasons? eh? hee-hee-hee!” “i repeat,” cried raskolnikov in a fury, “i can’t tolerate this any longer . . .” “what, sir? is it the uncertainty?” porfiry interrupted. “don’t mock me! i won’t have it! i tell you, i won’t have it. i can’t stand it, and i won’t! do you hear me? do you?” he cried, banging his fist on the table again. “quiet down, quiet! they’ll hear! i warn you in earnest: take care of yourself. i’m not joking!” porfiry said in a whisper, but this time there was none of his previous womanly generosity and frightened expression; on the contrary, now he was plainly ordering him, sternly, knitting his brows and seeming to banish at once all secrets and ambiguities. but that lasted only a moment. raskolnikov, now perplexed, suddenly flew into a complete fury; but, strange to say, once again he obeyed the order to speak more quietly, even though he was suffering a strong paroxysm of rage. “i won’t allow you to torment me!” he whispered suddenly, the same way he had before, instantly aware that he was unable to ignore the order; as a result of this thought, he felt even greater rage. “arrest me, search me, but be so good as to act in accordance with the proper forms; don’t play with me, sir! don’t you dare . . .” “don’t trouble yourself about the proper forms,” porfiry interrupted with his previous crafty smile, even seeming to admire raskolnikov with some enjoyment. “i’ve invited you here now, old boy, informally, in a completely friendly manner!” “i don’t want your friendship, and i spit at it! do you hear? now, look: i’m taking my cap and leaving. well then, what do you say now, if you intend to arrest me?” he grabbed his cap and headed for the door. “don’t you want to see the little surprise i have?” porfiry said with a giggle, once again grabbing him a little above his elbow and stopping him at the door. he was clearly becoming more and more cheerful and playful, and that positively caused raskolnikov to lose control of himself. “what sort of surprise? what is it?” he asked, suddenly pausing and regarding porfiry with fright. “a little surprise, sir, right here, waiting on the other side of my door, hee-hee-hee!” (he pointed to the closed door in the partition that led to his official living quarters.) “i locked it in, so it wouldn’t run away.” “what is it? where? what?” raskolnikov approached the door and wanted to open it, but it was locked. “it’s locked, sir. here’s the key!” and as a matter of fact, he took the key from his pocket and showed it to him. “you’re still lying!” howled raskolnikov,"
dostoevsky,"no longer able to restrain himself. “you’re lying, you clown, you damned punchinello!” # he cried, and rushed at porfiry, who retreated toward the door but didn’t flinch in the least. “i understand everything, everything!” he said, leaping in his direction. “you’re lying and teasing me, so i’ll give myself away . . .” “you can’t give yourself away any more, old boy, rodion romanych. you’re in a rage. don’t shout or i’ll call the others in here, sir!” “you’re lying. nothing will happen! call them in! you knew i was ill, and you wanted to annoy me, drive me into a fury, so that i’d give myself away; that was your aim! no, present your facts! i’ve understood everything! you have no facts. you have only worthless, insignificant guesses, zametov’s guesses! you knew my character; you wanted to drive me into a fury and then suddenly startle me with priests and deputies. . . . you’re waiting for them? eh? what are you waiting for? where are they? present them!” “what sort of deputies are you talking about, old boy? the things a person imagines! and to do as you say would not be according to the form; you don’t know what the proper procedure is, my dear. . . . the form hasn’t gone away, sir, you’ll see for yourself!” muttered porfiry, listening at the door. and as a matter of fact, at that moment some noise could be heard in the other room, right behind the door. “ah, here they come!” cried raskolnikov. “you sent for them! you’ve been waiting for them! you were counting on it. . . . well, bring them all in here: deputies, witnesses, whatever you want . . . bring them in! i’m ready! i am!” but then a strange thing happened, something so unexpected in the normal course of events that neither raskolnikov nor porfiry petrovich could have counted on such a denouement. * “simply” (french). † a reference to the judicial reforms of . ‡ russian peasants; in common usage, also means louts or bumpkins. § in , during the crimean war, russian armies were defeated at the alma river and retreated to sevastopol. ¶ “court council of war” (german). in , the austrian army, commanded by general mack, surrendered to napoleon. # a classical character of seventeenth-century commedia dell’arte that became a stock character in neapolitan puppetry. oceanofpdf.com vi a fterward, remembering this moment, raskolnikov recalled it as follows. the noise coming from behind the door suddenly increased, and the door opened slightly. “what’s the matter?” cried porfiry petrovich with annoyance. “i warned you that . . .” for a moment there was no reply, but it was clear that several people were standing behind the door and seemed to be pushing someone. “what’s going on?” porfiry repeated in agitation. “they’ve brought in the prisoner, nikolai,” someone’s voice was heard saying. “not now! go away! wait a bit! how did he get here? what a lack of discipline!” porfiry cried, rushing to the door. “but he . . .” that voice was about to begin again but stopped short. for a few seconds, not more, an actual struggle occurred; then it suddenly seemed that someone shoved someone else forcefully, after which a very pale man stepped into porfiry petrovich’s office. this man’s appearance, at first glance, was very strange. he was staring straight ahead but seemed not to see anyone. resolution shone in his eyes, but at the same time his face revealed a deathly pallor, as if he were being led to his execution. his lips, totally white, were trembling slightly. he was still very young, dressed like a common worker, of medium height, gaunt, hair cropped around his head, and with fine, seemingly dry facial features. the person he had unexpectedly shoved aside came rushing into the room and managed to grab him by the shoulder: this was a guard, but nikolai yanked his arm away and freed himself once again. a few curious onlookers crowded into the doorway. some of them tried to get into the room. everything described here took place almost in a single moment. “go away, it’s too early! wait till you’re called! why did you bring him so soon?” porfiry petrovich muttered in extreme annoyance, as if completely confused. but nikolai suddenly sank to his knees. “what are you doing?” porfiry cried in astonishment. “i’m guilty! i’m a sinner! i’m the ‘moiderer’!” nikolai suddenly announced, as if gasping for breath somewhat, but in a rather loud voice. the silence lasted about ten seconds, as if they were all stunned; even the guard took a step back and no longer tried to approach nikolai; he retreated automatically to the door and stood there motionless. “what’s all this?” cried porfiry petrovich, emerging from his momentary stupor. “i’m the . . . ‘moiderer,’ ” repeated nikolai, after a brief pause. “what . . . you. . . . what. . . . who did you kill?” porfiry petrovich, apparently, was flustered. nikolai paused once again. “alyona ivanovna and her sister lizaveta ivanovna . . . i killed them . . . with an axe. everything went blank . . .” he added suddenly and fell silent again. he was still on his knees. porfiry petrovich stood there for several moments, as if lost in thought, but suddenly came back to life and waved the uninvited witnesses away. they immediately disappeared, and the door was closed. then he glanced at raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner staring wildly at nikolai. porfiry was about to approach him, but stopped suddenly, looked at him, shifted his gaze at once to nikolai, then back to raskolnikov, then again to nikolai, and at once, as if carried away, and then turned on nikolai again. “why are you rushing ahead with your ‘everything went blank’?” he shouted at him, almost in a fury. “i haven’t asked you yet whether everything went blank or not . . . tell me: did"
dostoevsky,"you kill them?” “i’m the ‘moiderer’ . . . i’ll testify . . .” declared nikolai. “e-eh! how did you kill them?” “with an axe. i got one.” “eh, he’s in a hurry! alone?” nikolai didn’t understand the question. “did you kill them alone?” “alone. mitka’s innocent and had nothing to do with it.” “don’t be in such a hurry to talk about mitka. e-eh! why did you, well, why did you run down the stairs just then? the caretakers bumped into the two of you, didn’t they?” “i did it to hoodwink them . . . then . . . i ran with mitka,” replied nikolai as if hurrying and having prepared his answer beforehand. “well, so that’s it!” porfiry cried angrily. “he’s using someone else’s words!” he muttered, as if to himself; then, all of a sudden, he noticed raskolnikov once more. apparently, he was so distracted by nikolai that for a moment he had even forgotten all about raskolnikov. now he suddenly came to his senses and was even embarrassed . . . “rodion romanovich, old boy! excuse me, sir!” he said, rushing over to him. “this isn’t right, sir; please, sir. . . . you have no business here . . . and i myself. . . . you see what surprises we have! would you mind, sir?” taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door. “it seems you weren’t expecting this?” said raskolnikov, still not understanding anything very clearly, of course, though he had already managed to take heart. “you didn’t expect it either, old boy. look at how your hand is trembling! he-he!” “you’re trembling, too, porfiry petrovich.” “i am trembling, sir; i didn’t expect it, sir!” they were standing in the doorway. porfiry waited impatiently for raskolnikov to leave. “aren’t you going to show me your little surprise?” raskolnikov said all of a sudden. “he can say that even though his teeth are still chattering, he-he! what an ironic fellow you are! well, sir, good-bye, sir.” “in my opinion, we might as well say farewell. ” “as god wills it, sir, as god wills it!” muttered porfiry with a twisted smile. as he made his way through the office, raskolnikov noticed that many people were staring at him intently. in the hallway, among the crowd, he noticed the two caretakers from that house, the same two he’d told to fetch the police that night. they were standing there waiting for something. but as soon as he reached the stairs, he suddenly heard porfiry petrovich’s voice again. turning around, he saw that he was running after him, panting for breath. “one more word, sir, rodion romanovich, about all this; it’s as god wills it, nevertheless, according to our procedure, there are still some things i want to ask you about, sir. . . . so we’ll see each other again, we will, sir.” porfiry stopped in front of him with a smile. “we will, sir,” he added once more. one might suppose that he wanted to say something more, but somehow didn’t manage it. “and you must forgive me, porfiry petrovich, for what i said before. . . . i got angry,” raskolnikov began, now feeling completely encouraged, even experiencing a desire to swagger a bit. “never mind, sir, never mind,” porfiry replied almost joyfully. “i, too, sir. . . . i have a venomous character, i confess, i confess! we’ll see each other again, sir. if god wills it, we’ll see each other many times, sir!” “and really get to know each other well?” observed raskolnikov. “and really get to know each other well,” agreed porfiry petrovich. squinting, he looked at him very seriously. “are you going to a name-day party now, sir?” “to a funeral, sir.” “oh, yes, to a funeral! take care of your health, your health, sir . . .” “i don’t know what to wish you in return,” replied raskolnikov, already heading down the stairs, but suddenly turning again to porfiry. “i’d wish you great success, but you see how amusing your job is!” “how is it amusing, sir?” asked porfiry petrovich, who had turned to go. he pricked up his ears. “well, what about that poor mikolka, whom you must have tormented and tortured, psychologically, that is, in your own way, until he confessed. day and night, you must have been trying to prove to him: ‘you’re the murderer, you’re the murderer.’ and now that he’s confessed, you start to pick him to pieces again: ‘you’re lying,’ you tell him, ‘you’re not the murderer! you couldn’t be! you’re repeating someone else’s words!’ well, after all that, isn’t it really an amusing job?” “he-he-he! so you noticed that i told nikolai just now that he was ‘using someone else’s words’?” “how could one not notice?” “he-he! clever, sir, very clever. you notice everything! you’ve a genuinely playful mind, sir! you seize hold of the most comical aspects . . . he-he! it’s gogol, the writer, who’s said to possess that trait to the highest degree, isn’t it?” “yes, gogol.” “yes, sir. gogol, sir. . . . till our next most pleasant meeting, sir.” “our next most pleasant meeting . . .” raskolnikov went straight home. he felt so confused and bewildered that when he got there he threw himself on the sofa; he sat for a quarter of an hour merely resting, trying somehow or other to collect his thoughts. he didn’t even begin thinking about nikolai: he felt dumbfounded; there was something inexpressible, incredible in nikolai’s confession, something he was completely unable to grasp now. but nikolai’s confession was a genuine fact. the consequences of it immediately became clear to him: the lie had to be uncovered, and then they would come after him again. but at least he was free until that time, and he absolutely had to do something for himself, because the danger was unavoidable. but to what degree? the situation began to clarify. recalling in rough form, in general, the entire"
dostoevsky,"recent scene with porfiry, he couldn’t keep from shuddering once again in terror. of course, he still didn’t know all of porfiry’s aims; he couldn’t fathom all of his recent moves. but a part of his game had been revealed, and nobody, of course, could better understand than he how terrifying this last “move” was. a little more, and he might have given himself away completely, in actual fact. knowing the morbidity of his character, having understood him and grasped him from the first glance, porfiry was acting almost with certainty, although perhaps too decisively. there was no argument: raskolnikov had already managed to compromise himself too much, but no facts had yet been established. it was all still only circumstantial. but did he really, really understand it all now? wasn’t he perhaps making a mistake? what result had porfiry been after today? had he really had something prepared for him today? what exactly was it? had he really been waiting for something or not? how would they have parted today if the unexpected disaster with nikolai hadn’t occurred? porfiry had shown almost his entire game; of course, he took a risk, but he showed it (so it all seemed to raskolnikov), and if he’d really had anything more, he would have revealed that, too. “what on earth was that ‘surprise’? was it a joke? did it mean anything, or not? could it have concealed anything resembling facts or a positive accusation? the man from yesterday? where had he gone? where was he today? if porfiry really had anything positive, then of course it was in connection with the man from yesterday . . .” he sat on the sofa, his head hanging down, resting his elbows on his knees and covering his face with his hands. a nervous tremor shook his whole body. at last he stood up, took his cap, thought for a bit, and headed for the door. he had the strong feeling that, at least for today, he could almost certainly consider himself out of danger. all of a sudden, he experienced a feeling like joy in his heart: he felt like hurrying to katerina ivanovna’s. of course, he was late for the funeral, but he would get there in time for the wake, and there, right now, he would see sonya. he stopped, thought for a while, and a sickly smile appeared on his lips. “today! today!” he repeated to himself. “yes, today! it has to be . . .” he was just about to open the door when it suddenly began to open on its own. he shuddered and jumped back. the door opened slowly and quietly, and all of a sudden a figure appeared—it was yesterday’s man from out of nowhere. the man paused on the threshold, stared at raskolnikov in silence, and took a step into the room. he looked exactly the same as he had yesterday: the same figure, dressed the same way, but a major change had taken place in his face and in his glance: he now looked somehow saddened; standing there for a little while, he sighed deeply. the only thing missing was for him to place his hand on his cheek and to lean his head to one side for him to resemble a peasant woman. “what do you want?” asked the mortified raskolnikov. the man was silent and suddenly bowed deeply to him, almost down to the ground. at least, he touched the ground with one finger of his right hand. “what are you doing?” “i’m guilty,” said the man quietly. “of what?” “of wicked thoughts.” they both stared at each other. “i felt irritated. when you came there then, perhaps you were tipsy; you told the caretakers to summon the police, and you asked about the blood; i felt annoyed that they left you in vain and because they thought you were drunk. i was so annoyed that i lost sleep. but recalling your address, i came here yesterday and made inquiries . . .” “who came?” raskolnikov interrupted, momentarily starting to remember. “i did. i offended you.” “so you come from that same house?” “i was there, standing with them in the gateway, or have you forgotten? i’ve had my own profession there, for many years. we’re furriers, tradesmen, and work at home. . . . but most of all i was irritated . . .” and suddenly raskolnikov remembered clearly the whole scene from two days ago under the gateway; he recalled that in addition to the caretakers there had been several people standing there, including some women. he remembered one voice proposing that he should be taken right to the police. he couldn’t recall the face of the speaker, and even now he didn’t recognize him, but he did recall that he had turned toward him and had even made some reply at the time . . . so this, therefore, was how all of yesterday’s terror was resolved. the most terrible thing of all was to think that he’d almost perished, that he’d nearly destroyed himself as a result of this insignificant circumstance. this meant that besides the question about renting the apartment and the discussion about blood, this man could say nothing further. therefore, porfiry also had nothing, nothing except for this delirium, no facts, just psychology, which cut two ways, nothing positive. therefore, if no more facts were to appear (and they mustn’t appear, they mustn’t, they mustn’t!), then . . . then what could they do to him? what could they prove definitively, even if they arrested him? therefore, porfiry had found out about the apartment only now, just now, and hadn’t even known about it before. “did you tell porfiry this today . . . the fact that i came?” he cried, struck by a sudden idea. “what porfiry?” “the chief investigator.” “i did. the caretakers didn’t go to the police, but i did.” “today?” “i was there a minute before you. i heard everything, how he"
dostoevsky,"tormented you.” “where? what? when?” “right there; i was sitting there the whole time, behind his partition.” “what? so you were the surprise? how could that be? for heaven’s sake!” “after seeing,” began the tradesman, “that the caretakers wouldn’t listen to me and go to the police, because, they said, it was already too late, and perhaps he’d get angry that they hadn’t come right away, i felt irritated and couldn’t sleep, and i started to make inquiries. after finding out everything yesterday, i went today. at first when i came, he wasn’t there. i went back an hour later, but they wouldn’t admit me; the third time i came—they let me in. i began telling him everything that happened, and he began pacing around the room, beating his chest: ‘what,’ he says, ‘what are you scoundrels doing to me? if i’d known this, i’d have sent a guard to bring him here!’ then he ran out, summoned someone, and began talking to him in the corner; then he came back to me—and began asking questions and abusing me. he scolded me a great deal; i informed him about everything and said that you didn’t dare reply to what i’d said yesterday and that you hadn’t recognized me. he began running around again and kept on beating his chest, getting angry, and dashing about, and, when they said that you’d come, ‘well,’ he says, ‘hide behind the partition, sit here a while and don’t move, no matter what you hear.’ then he brought me a chair and locked the door: ‘perhaps,’ he says, ‘i’ll ask you to come in.’ when they brought in nikolai, he sent me away after you left: ‘i’ll want you again,’ he said, ‘and will ask you more questions . . .’ ” “did they question nikolai while you were still there?” “when you were shown out, then i was also shown out, and they began to question nikolai.” the tradesman paused and suddenly bowed once again, touching the floor with his finger. “forgive me for my slander and my malice.” “god will forgive you,” replied raskolnikov, and as soon as he said this, the tradesman bowed down to him, but this time not to the ground, only from his waist; he turned slowly and left the room. “everything cuts two ways, now everything cuts two ways,” repeated raskolnikov to himself, and he left the room feeling bolder than ever before. “now we’ll keep on fighting,” he said with a spiteful smile as he went down the stairs. the spite was directed at himself: he recalled his “cowardice” with contempt and shame. oceanofpdf.com i t he morning that followed petr petrovich’s fateful meeting with dunechka and pulkheriya aleksandrovna produced a sobering effect on him as well. to his extreme displeasure, he was compelled little by little to accept as an accomplished and irrevocable fact what yesterday had seemed to him to be an almost fantastic occurrence, still inconceivable, even after it had actually occurred. the black serpent of wounded self-esteem had been sucking the blood out of his heart all night. the moment he got out of bed, petr petrovich looked at himself in the mirror. he was afraid that he might have had a bilious attack during the night. however, on that score, all was well for the time being; after seeing his pale, dignified face, which had grown fuller of late, petr petrovich even felt consoled for a moment in the full conviction that he could find another bride somewhere else, and she might even be a better one; but he immediately came to his senses and spat vigorously to one side, which caused his young friend and roommate, andrey semyonovich lebezyatnikov to smile sarcastically. petr petrovich noticed this smile and immediately held it against his young friend. lately he’d found many things to hold against him. his anger was redoubled when he suddenly realized that he shouldn’t have told andrey semyonovich about the results of yesterday’s interview. that was his second mistake yesterday, done in the heat of the moment, as a result of excessive expansiveness, in a moment of irritation. . . . then, all that morning, as if intentionally, one unpleasantness followed another. even in the senate a setback awaited him in the case he was pursuing. he was especially annoyed by the landlord of the apartment he had rented in view of his imminent marriage and decorated at his own expense: this landlord, a german tradesman who had become rich, would under no circumstance agree to cancel the contract that had just been signed, and demanded all of the penalties specified therein, in spite of the fact that petr petrovich was returning the apartment to him almost completely redecorated. it was the same in the furniture shop, where they didn’t want to refund even one ruble of his deposit for the furniture he had purchased, but which had still not been delivered to the apartment. “after all, i’m not going to get married just because i bought some furniture!” petr petrovich said to himself, grinding his teeth; and yet at the same time a desperate hope occurred to him once again: “has this all really fallen through and is it over and done with once and for all? is it really impossible to attempt it once more?” the thought of dunechka was gnawing seductively at his heart. he experienced this moment with agony, and, of course, if he could have killed raskolnikov just then by his wish alone, petr petrovich would have carried out that desire at once. “another mistake i made, besides that, was that i didn’t give them any money,” he thought glumly as he returned to lebezyatnikov’s little room. “why the devil did i act like a stingy jew? there wasn’t even anything to be gained by it! i thought i could keep them on a short leash and make them see me as their good fortune, but look what happened! damn it! no, if i’d handed"
dostoevsky,"them some fifteen hundred rubles for a dowry and for gifts, nice little boxes, toilet cases, jewelry, fabrics, and all sorts of trifles from knop’s and the english shop, then everything would have turned out better and . . . more certain! they couldn’t have refused me so easily! they’re the sort of people who certainly would have considered it their obligation to return both the gifts and the money in the case of a refusal; and it would have been difficult and painful for them to do so! besides, their consciences would have bothered them: how, they’d say, can we suddenly drive away a man who’s been so generous and sensitive up to now? hmm! i let the chance slip by!” grinding his teeth once again, petr petrovich called himself a fool—of course, only to himself. after coming to that conclusion, he returned home feeling twice as spiteful and irritated as when he’d left. the preparations for the wake in katerina ivanovna’s room aroused his curiosity somewhat. he had already heard something about it yesterday; he even recalled that he had been invited; but as a result of his own affairs, he let everything else slip from his attention. hastening to be informed by mrs. lippevekhsel, who was bustling about the table in katerina ivanovna’s absence (she was at the cemetery), he learned that the wake would be very festive, that almost all of the lodgers had been invited, even those unacquainted with the deceased, that even andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov had been invited, in spite of his previous quarrel with katerina ivanovna, and, finally, that he, too, petr petrovich, had not only been invited, but his arrival was expected with great impatience, since he was almost the most important guest among all the lodgers. amaliya ivanovna herself had also been invited with great fanfare, in spite of all the previous unpleasantness, and therefore she was fussing and taking charge now, almost deriving enjoyment from it all; in addition, even though she was dressed for mourning, her apparel was all new and silk; she was in her finery and proud of it. all of these facts and information suggested an idea to peter petrovich; he returned to his room—that is, to andrey semyonych lebezyatnikov’s room—in deep thought. the point was that he’d also found out that among the invited guests would be raskolnikov. for some reason, andrey semyonych had remained at home all that morning. petr petrovich’s relationship with this gentleman was rather strange, though also natural: petr petrovich despised and hated him beyond all measure, almost from the very first day when he had moved in, but at the same time he seemed to be somewhat afraid of him. upon his arrival in petersburg he had stayed with him not merely for reasons of tightfisted economy, although that was really the main reason, but also for another reason. while still in the provinces he had heard about andrey semyonych, his former ward, regarded as one of the most advanced young progressives, and even about the significant role he played in various intriguing and legendary circles. this surprised petr petrovich. these powerful, all-knowing circles, which despised and attacked everyone, had for a long time inspired petr petrovich with a particular kind of fear, one that was, however, completely undefined. of course, he himself, while still in the provinces, couldn’t possibly come to a precise understanding, even an approximate one, of something of this kind . like everyone else, he heard that especially in petersburg, there existed some progressives, nihilists, denouncers, and so on and so forth, but like many others, he exaggerated and distorted the meaning and importance of these names to the point of absurdity. most of all, he was afraid, and had been for several years, of denunciation, and that was the principal basis of his constant, exaggerated uneasiness, especially when he considered his dreams of transferring his activity to petersburg. in this regard he was scared, as they say, the way little children are often scared . several years ago in the provinces, while still only beginning his career, he’d encountered two instances of cruel denunciation of rather important local personages to whom he had up to then attached himself and who served as his patrons. one instance ended for the exposed personage in a particularly scandalous way, and the other almost ended in an extremely troublesome manner. that was why on his arrival in petersburg, petr petrovich decided to investigate as soon as possible what all this was about and, if necessary, to anticipate matters and ingratiate himself with “our younger generation.” in this instance he was relying on andrey semyonych; during his visit with raskolnikov, petr petrovich had somehow learned to repeat well-worn phrases blindly . . . of course, he had quickly managed to discern in andrey semyonych an extremely vulgar and simpleminded man. but this neither undermined nor encouraged petr petrovich’s views. even if he had been convinced that all progressives were such fools, even then his uneasiness would not have been alleviated. he himself had no particular interest in all these teachings, ideas, and systems (which andrey semyonych threw at him). he had his own aims. he merely wanted to discover as soon and as quickly as possible what had occurred here and how. were these people influential or not? did he personally have anything to fear or not? would they denounce him if he embarked on some enterprise or not? and if they were to denounce him, then what for, exactly? and why were people being denounced these days? moreover, could he not ingratiate himself somehow with them and deceive them, if they really were all that powerful? was this necessary or not? was it possible, for example, to advance his own career precisely through their intervention? in a word, there were hundreds of questions before him. this andrey semyonych was a short, weedy, and scrofulous little man who had served in some post, and whose hair was strangely fair, with"
dostoevsky,"muttonchop side whiskers of which he was very proud. in addition, his eyes were almost always sore. he had a rather soft heart, but his speech was self-assured, and at times even extremely arrogant—which, when compared to his slight figure, almost always appeared comical. amaliya ivanovna, however, considered him among her most respected lodgers, that is, he didn’t drink heavily and he paid his rent on time. in spite of all these qualities, andrey semyonovich really was a rather stupid man. he had attached himself to the idea of progress and to “our younger generation” out of eagerness. he was one of a countless and diverse legion of vulgar people, feeble retards, and uneducated morons who instantly and without fail latch onto the most fashionable current idea in order to vulgarize it and immediately caricature the cause they themselves sometimes serve in a most sincere manner. however, lebezyatnikov, in spite of the fact that he was a nice man, had also begun to have some difficulty tolerating his fellow lodger and former mentor petr petrovich. this had occurred on both sides somehow unexpectedly and mutually. no matter how simpleminded andrey semyonovich was, little by little he still began to see that petr petrovich was deceiving him, that he secretly despised him, and that he was “not the man he seemed to be.” he tried to explain fourier’s system and darwin’s theory to him, but petr petrovich, especially as of late, had begun listening to him with excessive sarcasm, and most recently of all—had even begun to quarrel with him. the fact is, instinctually he was beginning to realize that lebezyatnikov was not only a vulgar and stupid little man, but, perhaps, even a paltry liar, and that he had no more important connections whatsoever even in his own circle, and merely heard something thirdhand; furthermore, perhaps he didn’t even know his own propagandistic business very well, because he would get all mixed up; so how could he possibly be a denouncer? by the way, we’ll mention in passing that petr petrovich, during this last week and a half, willingly accepted (especially at first) andrey semyonych’s even extremely strange words of praise, that is, he didn’t object, for example, and even remained silent, if andrey semyonych ascribed to him a willingness to assist with the future and speedy organization of a new “commune” somewhere on meshchan­skaya street or, for example, not to interfere with dunechka if, during the first month of their marriage, she were to decide to take a lover, or not to christen his future children, and so on and so forth—all in this same vein. petr petrovich, as was his usual custom, didn’t object to such qualities attributed to him and even allowed himself to be praised for them—since he found any praise pleasant to hear. petr petrovich, who that morning had for some reason exchanged several five percent government bonds, was sitting at a table counting packets of banknotes and bonds. andrey semyonovich, who almost never had any money, was pacing the room and pretending that he regarded all these packets with indifference and even with disdain. petr petrovich couldn’t possibly believe, for example, that andrey semyonovich could view such money with indifference; andrey semyonovich, on his part, thought bitterly that in fact petr petrovich was capable of thinking that about him, and perhaps he was even happy to annoy and tease his young friend with the packets of banknotes displayed, reminding him of his insignificance and the substantial difference between the two of them. this time he found him unbelievably irritable and inattentive, in spite of the fact that he, andrey semyonovich, had begun to expatiate on his favorite theme of establishing a new, special “commune.” the brief objections and remarks that emerged from petr petrovich in the intervals between the rhythmic clicking of the abacus beads were steeped in the most obvious and intentionally impolite sarcasm. but the “humane” andrey semyonovich ascribed petr petrovich’s disposition to the lingering effects of yesterday’s break with dunechka; he was burning with a desire to speak about that subject. he had something to say on that account that was both progressive and propagandistic and could console his esteemed friend and “undoubtedly” promote his subsequent development. “what sort of feast is being organized at that . . . widow’s apartment?” petr petrovich asked suddenly, interrupting andrey semyonovich at the most interesting point. “as if you didn’t know; i told you about it yesterday and expressed my thoughts about all these rituals. . . . i hear that she’s also invited you to attend. you yourself spoke with her yesterday . . .” “i never expected that this penniless fool of a woman would spend all the money she received from that other fool . . . raskolnikov . . . on a funeral feast. . . . as i walked past, i was even quite astonished: such preparations are under way—wines! they’ve invited quite a few people—the devil knows what’s happening!” continued petr petrovich, expanding on this conversation as if he had some purpose. “what? you say that they’ve even invited me?” he suddenly added, raising his head. “when was that? i don’t recall, sir. but i won’t go. what will i do there? i merely spoke with her yesterday, in passing, about the possibility of her receiving a year’s salary as one-time assistance since she’s the destitute widow of a civil servant. could that be why she’s inviting me? he-he!” “i’m not planning to go, either,” said lebezyatnikov. “i should think not! you gave her quite a beating with your own hands. i can understand that you’re ashamed, he-he-he!” “who gave a beating? to whom?” lebezyatnikov suddenly became alarmed and even blushed. “why, it was you. you gave katerina ivanovna a beating a month ago, didn’t you? i heard about it, sir, yesterday, sir. . . . so that’s what your convictions are! so much for the woman question. * he-he-he!” petr petrovich, as if satisfied, went back to"
dostoevsky,"clicking the beads on his abacus. “that’s all nonsense and slander!” lebezyatnikov retorted, his temper flaring up. he constantly feared any reminders about this episode. “it wasn’t like that at all! it was completely different. . . . you didn’t hear the truth; it’s just gossip! i was merely defending myself at the time. she came at me first with her nails out. . . . she plucked out all my side whiskers. . . . every man’s entitled, i hope, to defend his own person. besides that, i won’t allow anyone to use violence against me. . . . on principle. because that’s already almost despotism. what was i supposed to do? just stand there in front of her? i simply pushed her away.” “he-he-he!” luzhin continued to mock him maliciously. “you’re provoking me because you’re angry and in a bad temper. . . . this is nonsense and in no way, none at all, does it concern the woman question. you don’t understand; i even thought that if a woman’s equal to a man in all regards, even in physical strength (which, arguably, is possible), then, of course, there must be equality there, too. of course, later i decided that such a question, in essence, shouldn’t even arise because there shouldn’t be any fights at all, and that such fights would be inconceivable in a future society . . . and that it was a strange thing, of course, to look for equality in a fight. i’m not that foolish . . . although fights do occur, that is, they won’t in the future, but for now they still do. . . . phew! damn it all! it’s hard to talk to you! the fact that there was this unpleasantness is not why i won’t go to the wake. i won’t go simply on principle, so as not to participate in this vile superstition, that’s what! however, one could attend merely to make fun of it. . . . it’s a pity there won’t be any priests there. or else i’d certainly go.” “that is, you’d enjoy someone’s hospitality and then spit on it, the same as you would on those who invited you there. is that it?” “i wouldn’t spit on it at all, but i would protest. i have a beneficial aim. i might indirectly serve the cause of their development and our propaganda. every person is obligated to develop and propagandize, perhaps the tougher the better. i might be able to toss out an idea, a seed. . . . from this seed, facts could grow. how would i be offending them? at first they may take offense, but then they themselves will see that i’ve rendered them a service. consider the case of terebeva (who’s in the commune now); she was criticized when she left her family and . . . gave herself to a man; she wrote to her mother and father that she didn’t want to live among prejudices and was going to enter a common-law marriage; people thought this was being too rude to her parents, that it should have been possible to spare them, to express it more gently. in my opinion, that’s all nonsense: it wasn’t necessary to write more gently; on the contrary, on the contrary, it’s necessary to protest. consider that varents spent seven years living with her husband, abandoned her two children, and in her letter she quipped to her husband, ‘i realized that i couldn’t be happy with you. i’ll never forgive you for having deceived me, for hiding the fact that there exists another way of organizing society in the form of a commune. i found all this out recently from a very magnanimous man, to whom i gave myself; we’ll establish a commune together. i’m telling you this in all honesty because i think it’s dishonorable to deceive you. do whatever you think is best. don’t try to make me come back; it’s too late for that. i wish you happiness.’ that’s how such letters should be written!” “is that terebeva the same one you told me about, the one who’s entered her third common-law marriage?” “only the second, if you count properly! even if it’s the fourth, or the fifteenth, that’s all nonsense! if i ever regretted that my father and mother died, i do now, of course. i’ve even dreamt more than once that if they were still alive, i’d wallop them with my protest! i’d let them down intentionally. . . . another ‘bird flown the coop’! i’d show them! i’d astound them! it’s really a pity that there’s no one left!” “astound them? he-he! well, let it be,” petr petrovich interrupted. “but tell me this: you seem to know the daughter of the deceased man, that very frail girl! is what they say about her completely true, huh?” “so, what of it? in my opinion, that is, according to my personal conviction, that’s exactly the most normal condition of a woman. why not? that is, distinguons . † in today’s society, of course, it’s not altogether normal, because it’s forced on her, but in the future it will be completely normal because it will be freely chosen. why, even now she had a right: she was suffering, and that was her fund, so to speak, her capital, which she had the absolute right to expend. naturally, in a future society, there’ll be no need for such funds; but her role will have a different meaning, organized harmoniously and rationally. as far as sofiya semyonovna herself is concerned, at the present time i regard her actions as a vigorous and personal protest against the social order, and i respect her deeply for it; i even rejoice looking at her!” “but i was told that you’re the one who forced her out of this apartment house!” lebezyatnikov was absolutely furious. “that’s more slander!” he wailed. “that’s not at all how it was, not how it was at all! that’s just katerina"
dostoevsky,"ivanovna telling tales because she didn’t understand a thing. i didn’t make a play for sofiya semyonovna at all! i was simply trying to educate her, completely innocently, trying to incite her to protest. . . . it was only the protest i wanted, but sofiya semyonovna herself felt that she couldn’t remain here in this apartment house!” “was she being invited to join the commune then?” “you keep laughing; allow me to observe that it’s not very appropriate. you don’t understand a thing! there are no such roles in a commune. a commune is organized so that there won’t be any roles like that. in a commune, her role will change its present meaning; that which is foolish here will become clever there; that which is unnatural here, under present circumstances, will become completely natural there. everything depends on circumstance and environment. it all depends on the environment, and the person himself means nothing. i’m on good terms with sofiya semyonovna even now, and you can take it as proof that she never considered me her enemy or her offender. yes! i’m trying to tempt her to join the commune now, but on a completely different basis! what’s so funny? we want to organize our commune in a special way, but only on a broader foundation than previously. we’ve gone further in our convictions. we reject more things! if dobrolyubov were to rise from the grave, i’d have a quarrel with him. as for belinsky, i’d make mincemeat of him! ‡ meanwhile, i continue to educate sofiya semyonovna. she is a splendid, splendid individual!” “well, and you’re taking advantage of this splendid individual, eh? he-he!” “no, no! oh, no! on the contrary!” “well, then, on the contrary! he-he-he! what a thing to say!” “you must believe me! for what reason would i hide it from you, please tell me! on the contrary, this seems strange even to me: she’s somehow intensely, timidly chaste and shy with me!” “and, of course, you’re educating her . . . he-he! you’re proving to her that all this shyness is nonsense?” “not at all. not at all! oh, you’re so rude, you even interpret—forgive me—the word ‘development’ in a stupid manner! you don’t understand a thing, not a thing! oh, lord, you’re still so . . . undeveloped! we’re working for the emancipation of women, while you have only one thing on your mind. . . . ignoring completely the question of chastity and women’s shyness as useless things in and of themselves, and even prejudicial, i fully, absolutely support her chastity with me because that’s a matter of her own free will, her own right. of course, if she herself were to say, ‘i want to have you,’ then i’d consider myself very fortunate, because i really do like the young woman; but now, now at least, no one, of course, ever treated her more politely and courteously than i do, or with more respect for her dignity. . . . i wait and hope—and that’s all!” “it would be better if you gave her some sort of gift. i bet you haven’t even thought of that.” “you don’t understand a thing, i told you! of course, that’s the position she’s in, but there’s another question involved here! completely different! you simply despise her. seeing a fact that you mistakenly consider worthy of contempt, you refuse to regard a human being in a humane way. you still don’t know what sort of person she is! i’m merely sorry that of late she seems to have stopped reading and no longer borrows any books from me. previously she did. it’s also a pity that with all her energy and resolve to protest—which she’s demonstrated before—she still seems to have little self-reliance, so to speak, little independence, too little negation in her to free herself completely from various prejudices and . . . stupidities. this is in spite of the fact that she understands some of these questions perfectly. for example, she understood the matter of kissing a woman’s hand perfectly—that is, that a man offends a woman by unequal treatment if he kisses her hand. this question was debated among us, and i told her about it immediately. she also listened very attentively when i told her about the workers’ associations in france. now i’m explaining to her the matter of a couple’s free access to each other’s rooms in a future society.” § “what’s that about?” “the question has been debated recently: does a member of the commune have the right to enter another member’s room, a man’s or a woman’s, at any time. . . . well, it was decided that they do . . .” “what if he or she is occupied at the moment with a natural necessity, he-he!” andrey semyonovich grew very angry. “you go on about the same thing, these damned ‘necessities’!” he cried with hatred. “bah! i’m so angry and annoyed that in explaining the system i mentioned to you prematurely these natural necessities! damn it all! it’s a stumbling block for anyone like you, and worst of all—you ridicule it before finding out what it’s all about! as if they were right! as if they had something to be proud of! bah! i’ve insisted several times that this question can be explained to novices only at the very end, when a person’s already committed to the system, when he’s educated and politically progressive. please tell me what you find so embarrassing and contemptible, even in cesspools? i myself would be the first to clean out any cesspools you like! there’s no kind of self-sacrifice involved! it’s simply work, a noble, useful activity to society, one worth as much as any other, and is a much higher activity, for example, than that of some raphael or pushkin, because it’s more useful!” ¶ “and more noble, more noble, he-he-he!” “what’s ‘more noble’? i don’t understand such expressions when used to describe human activity. ‘more noble,’ ‘more magnanimous’—that’s"
dostoevsky,"all nonsense, foolishness, old prejudicial words that i reject! everything that’s useful to humanity, that’s noble! i understand only one word: useful ! sneer as much as you like, but that’s the truth!” petr petrovich was laughing wholeheartedly. he had already finished counting his money and had hidden it away. however, for some reason, a certain amount of cash had been left on the table. this “question of cesspools,” in spite of all its vulgarity, had served several times as the cause of a dispute and disagreement between petr petrovich and his young friend. the stupid thing was that andrey semyonych was really angry. luzhin, on the other hand, had gotten a load off his chest by mentioning it and at the present time, particularly, felt like teasing lebezyatnikov a little. “it’s because of your bad luck yesterday that you’re so mean and you’re pestering me,” lebezyatnikov burst out at last; generally speaking, in spite of all his “independence” and his “protests,” he was somehow afraid to oppose petr petrovich; in general, he treated him with deference, as he had in previous years. “it would be better for you to tell me,” petr petrovich said, interrupting him arrogantly and with annoyance, “whether you can . . . or, to put it better, are you on good enough terms with the aforementioned young person to invite her in here for a minute, into this room? they seem to have returned from the cemetery. . . . i hear the sound of people moving around. . . . i’d like to have a word with her, sir, with that person, sir.” “what do you want her for?” lebezyatnikov asked in surprise. “just so, sir, i’d like to, sir. i’ll be leaving here today or tomorrow, and therefore would like to tell her that. . . . however, please stay here during my conversation with her. that would be even better. or else, god knows what you might think.” “i won’t think anything at all. . . . i merely asked you. if you have some business, there’s nothing easier than inviting her here. i’ll go at once. and you can be sure that i won’t interfere with you.” as a matter of fact, about five minutes later, lebezyatnikov returned with sonechka. she entered in extreme surprise and, as was her usual state, very timidly. she was always timid in similar circumstances and was very afraid of new people and new acquaintances; she’d been afraid even before, from childhood, and was now all the more so. . . . petr petrovich greeted her “in a friendly and polite manner,” however, with a certain hint of cheerful familiarity, which, in his opinion, was appropriate for such an esteemed and solid person as he was, in relation to such a young and interesting (in a certain sense) creature as sonya. he hastened to “reassure” her and seated her at the table opposite himself. sonya sat down, looked around—at lebezyatnikov, at the money lying on the table, at petr petrovich again, and then didn’t take her eyes off him, as if her gaze were riveted to him. lebezyatnikov started to head for the door. petr petrovich stood up, indicated that sonya should stay where she was, and stopped lebezyatnikov in the doorway. “is that fellow raskolnikov there? has he come?” he asked in a whisper. “raskolnikov? he’s there. what of it? yes, he is. . . . he’s just arrived, i saw him. . . . why?” “well, i especially want you to stay here with us, and not leave me alone with this . . . girl. my business is inconsequential, but god knows what people might think. i don’t want raskolnikov talking about it there . . . . do you understand what i’m saying?” “ah, i understand, i understand,” lebezyatnikov cried suddenly, realizing what was happening. “yes, you have the right. . . . of course, in my personal opinion, you’re exaggerating the risks, but . . . still, you have the right. all right, i’ll stay here. i’ll stand by the window and won’t interfere. . . . i think you have the right . . .” petr petrovich returned to the sofa, sat down opposite sonya, looked at her intently, and suddenly assumed an extremely imposing, even somewhat stern appearance: “now, don’t you get any ideas, young lady.” sonya was completely baffled. “in the first place, please extend my apologies, sofiya semyonovna, to your esteemed mama. . . . that’s right, isn’t it? katerina ivanovna has taken the place of your mother, hasn’t she?” petr petrovich began very imposingly, but rather tenderly. it was apparent that he had the friendliest intentions. “yes, sir, that’s so, sir; the place of a mother, sir,” sonya replied hastily and timidly. “well, please apologize to her: due to certain unforeseeable circumstances, i’ll be forced to miss the pancakes . . . that is, the funeral feast, in spite of your mama’s kind invitation.” “yes, sir; i’ll tell her, sir; right away, sir.” sonechka hastened to jump up from her chair. “that’s still not everything,” petr petrovich said, stopping her, smiling at her simplicity and her unfamiliarity with proper decorum. “and you know me too little, dearest sofiya semyonovna, if you thought i’d disturb you personally to summon a person such as you for such an unimportant reason concerning me alone. i have a different aim.” sonya sat down hastily. the gray- and rainbow-colored banknotes, still left on the table, flashed in her eyes once again, but she quickly turned her face away and raised it to look at petr petrovich: all of a sudden it felt terribly inappropriate, especially for her, to stare at someone else’s money. she suddenly began to fix her gaze on petr petrovich’s golden lorgnette, which he held in his left hand, and on a large, massive, very beautiful ring with a yellow stone on the middle finger of that hand—but suddenly she averted her eyes from that, too, and not"
dostoevsky,"knowing where to look, wound up staring once again directly into petr petrovich’s eyes. after an even more imposing silence than before, he continued: “i happened to have had a brief chat with the unfortunate katerina ivanovna yesterday. a few words were enough to learn that she’s in a very . . . unnatural condition, if i may express it that way . . .” “yes, sir . . . unnatural, sir,” sonya hastened to agree. “or, it’s simpler and more understandable to say . . . she’s ill.” “yes, sir, it’s simpler and understand— . . . yes, sir. she’s ill, sir.” “well then. so, out of a feeling of humaneness and, and, and, so to speak, compassion, i would like, on my part, to be useful in some way, foreseeing her inevitably unhappy fate. it seems that the entire destitute family now depends on you alone.” “allow me to ask,” sonya said, suddenly standing up, “whether you spoke with her yesterday about the possibility of receiving a pension? because she told me yesterday that you had taken on yourself the task of obtaining a pension for her. is that true, sir?” “no, not at all, it’s even ridiculous in a certain sense. i merely hinted about temporary assistance to the widow of a civil servant who dies while still in service—if she happens to have some patronage—but it seems that your deceased father not only failed to serve out his time, but recently didn’t even work at all. in a word, though there might be some hope, it’s extremely slight, because in this case there’s no right to assistance, even maybe the opposite. . . . and she was already thinking about a pension, he-he-he! what a daring lady!” “yes, sir, about a pension. . . . because she’s gullible and kind; she’s so kind that she believes everything, and . . . and . . . and . . . she has that sort of mind. . . . yes, sir . . . excuse her, sir,” said sonya, and she got up to leave once again. “if you please, you still haven’t heard me out.” “yes, sir, i haven’t heard you out, sir,” muttered sonya. “do sit down.” sonya was terribly embarrassed and sat down again, for the third time. “seeing her situation, with the unfortunate young children, i would like—as i already indicated—to be useful in some way, as best i can, that is, as best i can, but no more. for example, it might be possible to organize a subscription for her, or a lottery, so to speak . . . or something of that sort—as is always done in similar cases by relatives or even by strangers, but in general by people wishing to assist. i had the intention of informing you about this. it might be possible.” “yes, sir, very good, sir. . . . god will reward you, sir . . .” sonya murmured, staring intently at petr petrovich. “it might be possible . . . but we’ll talk about it later . . . that is, we could start it even today. we’ll see this evening; we’ll discuss it and lay, so to speak, the foundation. come to see me here this evening around seven o’clock. andrey semyonych, i hope, will also participate with us. . . . but . . . there’s one circumstance involved that must be mentioned beforehand and in detail. that’s why i have disturbed you, sofiya semyonovna, with my summons here. namely, it’s my opinion that money must not be given directly to katerina ivanovna: it’s dangerous; the evidence for that is the funeral feast planned for today. without having, so to speak, a crust of bread for tomorrow’s meals and . . . well, any money for shoes or anything else, she’s purchased jamaican rum and even, it seems, madeira, and—and—and coffee. i saw it as i came past. tomorrow it will all fall upon you again, for the last piece of bread; this is absurd. therefore, even the subscription, in my personal opinion, must be carried out so that the unfortunate widow, so to speak, doesn’t know about the money, but that you, for example, are the only one who knows. am i right?” “i don’t know, sir. she’s only doing this today, sir . . . it’s once in a lifetime . . . she very much wanted to remember him, to honor him, his memory. . . . but she’s very smart, sir. but it’s as you like, sir, and i’ll be very, very, very . . . they’ll all be . . . and god will, sir . . . and the orphans, sir . . .” sonya didn’t finish and instead burst into tears. “well, then. so, keep this in mind; and now be so kind as to accept, in the interests of your relative, in the first instance, this modest sum from me personally. i very, very much hope that my name won’t be mentioned in connection with this gift. here you are . . . having, so to speak, my own concerns, i’m not in a position to . . .” petr petrovich extended a carefully unfolded ten-ruble note to sonya. sonya accepted it, blushed, jumped up, muttered something, and hastily began to take her leave. petr petrovich ceremoniously escorted her to the door. at last she bolted from the room, all agitated and exhausted, and returned to katerina ivanovna in extreme confusion. all during this scene, andrey semyonych stood next to the window or paced the room, not wishing to interrupt the conversation; after sonya left, he suddenly approached petr petrovich and formally extended his hand. “i heard everything and i saw everything,” he said, placing special emphasis on the word “saw.” “it’s noble, that is, i wanted to say, humane! you wanted to avoid her gratitude, i saw! and although, i confess, i can’t, in principle, sympathize with private charity, because it not only fails"
dostoevsky,"to eradicate radically the evil and even sustains it further, nevertheless, i can’t help confessing that i looked upon your act with pleasure—yes, yes, i like it very much.” “eh, it’s all nonsense!” muttered petr petrovich, appearing somewhat agitated and looking somehow closely at lebezyatnikov. “no, it’s not nonsense! a man who’s been insulted and provoked as you were by yesterday’s incident, and who is at the same time able to think about the misfortune of others—such a man, sir . . . although by his actions he is committing a social blunder—nevertheless . . . is worthy of respect! i certainly didn’t expect it from you, petr petrovich, all the more so given your understanding of things—oh! how your understanding still hinders you! how, for example, your failure yesterday upsets you,” exclaimed the tenderhearted andrey semyonych, once again feeling more strongly disposed to petr petrovich. “and why, why exactly do you want this marriage, this legal marriage, my dearest, most generous petr petrovich? why precisely must you have this legality in marriage? well, if you wish to, beat me, but i’m glad, very glad that it didn’t succeed, that you’re free, that you’re still not altogether lost for humanity, glad. . . . you see: i’ve had my say!” “because, sir, in this common-law marriage of yours i don’t want to wear a cuckold’s horns and bring up someone else’s children. that’s why i want a legal marriage,” said luzhin, in order to have something to reply. he was particularly preoccupied and thoughtful. “children? you mentioned children?” andrey semyonych shuddered like a warhorse who’d heard the sound of the trumpet. “children are a social question and one of primary importance, i agree; but the question of children will be resolved in another manner. some people even reject the idea of children, like any other indication of family life. we’ll talk about children later, but for now, we’ll deal with a cuckold’s horns! i confess that this is my weak point. it’s a nasty, hussar-like, pushkinian expression even unthinkable in a future lexicon. and what are those horns? oh, what a delusion! what horns? why horns? what nonsense! on the contrary, there won’t be any horns in a common-law marriage! horns are merely the consequence of any legal marriage, so to speak, its correction, a protest, so that in this sense they’re not even humiliating in the least. . . . and if at some time—let’s assume an absurdity—i were in a legal marriage, then i would even be glad of your accursed horns. then i would say to my wife: ‘my friend, up to now i merely loved you; now, however, i respect you because you were able to protest!’ # are you laughing? that’s because you’re not strong enough to free yourself from these prejudices! damn it, but i understand where the unpleasantness resides when people deceive each other in a legal marriage; but that’s merely the vile result of the vile fact in which both parties are humiliated. when the cuckold’s horns are worn openly, as in a common-law marriage, then they no longer exist; they’re inconceivable and even lose the designation as horns. on the contrary, your wife will merely prove to you that she respects you, considering you incapable of opposing her happiness, and so advanced in your thinking that you won’t take revenge on her for her new husband. damn it all, sometimes i dream that if i were ever given in marriage—bah! i mean if i ever chose to marry (by a common-law marriage or a legal one, it doesn’t matter which), i might even personally bring my wife a lover, if she took too long to find one herself. ‘my friend,’ i’d say to her, ‘i love you, but even more than that, i want you to respect me—so here!’ am i right in what i say? am i?” petr petrovich snickered as he listened, but without any special amusement. he didn’t even listen very attentively. he was really thinking about something else, and even lebezyatnikov finally noticed this. petr petrovich was even nervous, rubbing his hands, deep in thought. andrey semyonych thought about this and remembered it subsequently . . . * another reference to chernyshevsky’s novel what is to be done? and its progressive ideas about the liberation of women. † “let’s distinguish” (french). ‡ both nikolai dobrolyubov (–) and vissarion belinksy (–) were important radical critics in the mid-nineteenth century. § another reference to chernyshevsky’s novel. ¶ an allusion to the views of the radical critic dmitry pisarev (–). # a parody of an idea expressed in chernyshevsky’s novel. oceanofpdf.com ii i t would be difficult to specify precisely the reason why the idea of this ridiculous funeral feast was conceived in katerina ivanovna’s distraught brain. as a matter of fact, almost ten rubles had been squandered on it out of the more than twenty rubles she had received from raskolnikov for marmeladov’s funeral. perhaps katerina ivanovna considered herself obligated to her deceased husband to honor his memory “as befitting,” so that all the lodgers, including amaliya ivanovna, in particular, would know that “not only was he no worse than they, but perhaps, even much better,” and that not one of them had the right to “look down his nose” at him. perhaps the most powerful influence on her was that particular “pride of the poor,” as a result of which many poor people, in observing those social rituals required of each and every person by our way of life, strive with all their strength and spend the last kopecks of their life savings in order to appear “no worse than others,” and so that those same others won’t “criticize them.” it is also extremely likely that katerina ivanovna wanted, precisely in this case, precisely at this moment in time, when it seemed as if she’d been abandoned by everyone in the whole world, to show all these “worthless and nasty lodgers” that she not only “knew how to"
dostoevsky,"live and how to entertain guests,” but had been brought up not for such a fate in life but in the “noble, one could even say, aristocratic home of a colonel,” and that she had never been raised to sweep the floor or to wash the children’s rags at night. these paroxysms of pride and vanity sometimes occur in the poorest and most downtrodden people and at times turn into irritating and irrepressible necessity. moreover, katerina ivanovna was not downtrodden: circumstances might defeat her entirely, but they could not crush her morally, that is, they could not intimidate her or overpower her will. in addition, sonechka had solid grounds for saying that her mind was deranged. true, it was still not possible to state this absolutely and definitively; lately, for the entire past year, her poor brain had been tormented too much to escape without some damage. the rapid course of consumption, as doctors say, also promotes the impairment of one’s mental faculties. there wasn’t a great deal of wine or an array of different kinds, nor was there any madeira : that was an exaggeration; but there was some wine. there was vodka, rum, and lisbon wine, all of very poor quality, but all in sufficient quantity. as for the food, besides the traditional kutya, * there were three or four dishes (including pancakes, incidentally), all from amaliya ivanovna’s kitchen; in addition, two samovars were brought in to provide tea and punch after the meal. katerina ivanovna had provided the purchases herself, with the help of one lodger, some pitiful pole, who was living at madame lippevekhsel’s for some reason or other, and who’d immediately volunteered to assist katerina ivanovna with her errands, and had run around all the day before, and had raced around all that morning with his tongue hanging out, apparently hoping that this activity would be noticed by everyone. he kept running constantly to katerina ivanovna herself for every little thing, even searching for her at the shopping arcade, persistently calling her “madame ensign.” she finally grew so sick and tired of him, even though at first she would say that she would have been completely lost had it not been for this “obliging and generous” man. it was characteristic of katerina ivanovna to paint everybody and anybody she met in the best and brightest colors, to praise him such that others felt embarrassed, to conceive of various circumstances on their behalf that had never existed, to believe completely sincerely and wholeheartedly in their existence, and then all at once, suddenly, to be disillusioned, break off with them, humiliate them, and banish the person she had literally worshipped only a few hours ago. by nature she had a humorous, cheerful, and peace-loving character, but as a result of continual misfortunes and failures, she had begun furiously to desire and demand that everyone live in peace and joy and that they dare not live otherwise, that the least dissonance in life, the smallest failure, would drive her immediately into a frenzy, and in one moment, after the brightest aspirations and fantasies, she would begin to curse fate, tearing and smashing anything that came to hand and banging her head against the wall. amaliya ivanovna, for some reason, had also suddenly acquired unusual importance and unusual respect from katerina ivanovna, perhaps solely because the funeral feast was being prepared and amaliya ivanovna had resolved with all her heart to take part in all the work: she took it upon herself to set the table, procure the linen, crockery, and so forth, and to prepare the food in her kitchen. katerina ivanovna entrusted everything to her and left her alone, while she herself set off for the cemetery. as a matter of fact, everything had been wonderfully prepared: the table was set even rather elegantly; the dishes, forks, knives, goblets, glasses, cups—everything, of course, had been collected from various lodgers and didn’t match in style or quality, but everything was in place by the appointed time. amaliya ivanovna, feeling that she had accomplished her task extremely well, even greeted those returning with a certain pride; she had changed her clothes and was wearing a black dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons. for some reason, katerina ivanovna didn’t appreciate her pride, even though it was well deserved: “as if no one else knows how to set a table except for amaliya ivanovna!” and she also didn’t like her cap with the new ribbons: “isn’t this stupid german woman taking pride in the fact that she’s the landlady and has agreed to help some poor lodgers out of charity? out of charity! i ask you, really! at the house of katerina ivanovna’s papa, who was a colonel and had almost become a governor, the table was sometimes set for forty guests; someone like amaliya ivanovna—or, rather, amaliya lyudvigovna—wouldn’t even be allowed in the kitchen . . .” however, katerina ivanovna decided not to vent her feelings for the time being, although she resolved in her heart to put her in her place and remind her of who she really was, or else god knows what she might start thinking of herself; meanwhile, she merely treated her with coldness. another unpleasant circumstance furthered katerina ivanovna’s irritation: at the funeral, almost no one, not one of the lodgers who had been invited, showed up, except for the little pole, who even managed to make it to the cemetery; but at the wake—that is, for the refreshments—the most insignificant and poorest of them appeared, many of them even already intoxicated, the wretched good-for-nothings. but the older and more respectable of them absented themselves, as if on purpose, as if they had agreed in advance to skip the event. petr petrovich luzhin, for example, perhaps the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not attend; meanwhile, yesterday evening katerina ivanovna had managed to tell everyone on earth—that is, amaliya ivanovna, polechka, sonya, and the little pole—that this most respectable and most generous"
dostoevsky,"man, with his vast number of connections and his wealth, her first husband’s former friend, someone who had been received in her father’s house and who had promised to use all possible means to procure a considerable pension for her, this same luzhin did not appear. we’ll observe here that if katerina ivanovna bragged about anyone’s connections and wealth, it was without any self-interest, without any personal calculation, but was completely innocent, so to speak, out of the fullness of her heart, the sheer pleasure of bestowing praise and conferring more value to the person being praised. like luzhin and, probably, “following his example,” “that nasty scoundrel lebezyatnikov” had also failed to show up. “just who does he think he is? he was invited only out of kindness, and only because he shares a room with petr petrovich and is his acquaintance, so that it would have been awkward not to include him.” a fashionable lady with her “overripe spinster” of a daughter also failed to appear; they had resided at amaliya ivanovna’s rooms for only about two weeks, but had several times complained about the noise and shouts coming from the marmeladovs’, especially when the recently deceased arrived home drunk, about which katerina ivanovna had been informed by amaliya ivanovna, when she was quarreling with her and threatening to throw the whole family out; she was screaming at the top of her lungs that they were disturbing her “respectable lodgers, whose shoelaces she was unfit to tie.” katerina ivanovna made a point of intentionally inviting this lady and her daughter, whose “shoelaces she was unfit to tie,” all the more so since up to then in any incidental meeting, the lady would haughtily turn her face away—so that this lady would know that here “respectable people have thoughts and feelings, and invite others without holding a grudge,” and so that she would see that katerina ivanovna was not used to living in such circumstances. she definitely intended to make this clear to them at the table, as well as making the point about her late papa’s near governorship and, at the same time, hinting indirectly that there was no reason for her to turn away when meeting them and that such behavior was extremely foolish. the fat lieutenant colonel (in reality, a retired second lieutenant) also didn’t attend, but it turned out that he had been “dead tired” since yesterday morning. in a word, the only people who came were: the little pole, a shabby, silent pimply clerk in a soiled jacket who had a nasty smell; and also a deaf and almost blind little old man who at one time had served in a post office; he was a man someone had been supporting at amaliya ivanovna’s for ages and for unknown reasons. there was also a retired drunken lieutenant, in fact a quartermaster, with the most unpleasant loud laugh and, “just imagine,” who came without a vest! one of them sat right down at the table without even greeting katerina ivanovna. at length, one person was about to appear in his dressing gown because he didn’t own a suit, but this was so inappropriate that the combined efforts of amaliya ivanovna and the little pole succeeded in excluding him. the little pole brought with him two other poles who had never resided at amaliya ivanovna’s, and whom no one had seen before in these rooms. all of this irritated katerina ivanovna in an extremely unpleasant manner. “after all, who were all these preparations made for?” even the children, to save space, were not seated at the main table, which already occupied the entire room. their places had been set on a trunk in the far corner; the two little ones were placed on a bench, and polechka, as the biggest, was supposed to mind them, feed them, and wipe their noses “like respectable children.” in a word, katerina ivanovna was obligated against her will to greet everyone with redoubled dignity, even with haughtiness. she regarded several of the guests with particular sternness and condescendingly invited them to sit down at the table. having decided for some reason that amaliya ivanovna was responsible for those who didn’t appear, she suddenly began to address her with excessive rudeness, which amaliya ivanovna noticed immediately, becoming extremely piqued. such a beginning did not bode well for a good ending. at last everyone was seated. raskolnikov entered almost exactly at the same time they were returning from the cemetery. katerina ivanovna was terribly glad to see him, in the first place because he was the only “educated guest” out of all those present and, “as is well known, he was preparing to occupy a professor’s chair at the local university two years hence.” in the second place, it was because he promptly and respectfully apologized to her that in spite of his strong desire, he had been unable to attend the funeral. she pounced on him at once and sat him down at the table on her left side (amaliya ivanovna was sitting on her right); in spite of her constant fussing and concern that the food would be served properly and that there be enough for everyone, and in spite of the tormenting cough that plagued her continually and choked her and, it seems, had worsened particularly in the last two days, she constantly turned to raskolnikov and in a half whisper hastened to pour out to him all her pent-up feelings and all her righteous indignation over the unsuccessful funeral feast; this indignation alternated with fits of the most cheerful and most unrestrained laughter at the assembled guests, primarily directed at her landlady. “that cuckoo is to blame for everything. you understand who i’m talking about: about her, her!” katerina ivanovna nodded at the landlady. “just look at her: her eyes are popping out; she knows we’re talking about her, but she can’t understand, and her eyes are wide open. phew, what an owl she is! ha-ha-ha! cough-cough-cough! and what’s"
dostoevsky,"she trying to prove with that cap of hers? cough-cough-cough! have you noticed that she wants everyone to think she’s patronizing me and doing me an honor by coming? i asked her, as a respectable woman, to invite a better class of people, especially acquaintances of the deceased, but just look at who she’s brought: such clowns! sluts! look at that fellow with the dirty face: he’s a snotnose on two legs! and those nasty little poles . . . ha-ha-ha! cough-cough -cough! no one, no one at all has ever seen them here before, and i’ve never seen them either; why did they come, i ask you? they’re sitting properly, all in a row. hey, sir!” she cried out suddenly to one of them, “have you had any pancakes? have some more! drink some beer, more beer! wouldn’t you like some vodka? look: he’s jumped up and is bowing. look, look: they must be very hungry, the poor fellows! never mind, let them eat. at least they’re not making any noise, only . . . only, i’m afraid for the landlady’s silver spoons! amaliya ivanovna!” she said almost audibly, suddenly turning in her direction, “if by any chance they pinch your spoons, i’m not responsible for them, i warn you in advance! ha-ha-ha!” she roared with laughter. turning back to raskolnikov, she nodded again at the landlady and enjoyed her little attack. “she hasn’t understood, once again she didn’t understand! she’s sitting there with her mouth open wide, just look: she’s like an owl, a genuine screech owl in her cap with new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!” again her laughter turned into unbearable coughing that lasted five minutes. some blood was left on her handkerchief, and beads of perspiration stood out on her forehead. she silently showed the blood to raskolnikov and, with hardly a pause, whispered to him again with extreme animation and with red blotches on her cheeks: “just look: i gave her a most delicate commission, one could say, to invite that lady and her daughter. do you understand whom i’m talking about? one must behave in the most delicate manner, act in the most skillful way, but she carried it out so that this newly arrived fool, this haughty creature, this insignificant provincial woman, simply because she’s some sort of major’s widow who’s come to petition for a pension and is beating down office doors, and who, at the age of fifty-five, dyes her hair black and wears both powder and rouge (this is well known) . . . this creature not only didn’t think it fitting to appear, but didn’t even send a message of apology that she couldn’t come, as considered correct by the most ordinary rules of politeness in such circumstances! i can’t understand why petr petrovich didn’t come, either! and where’s sonya? where has she gone? ah, here she is at last! well, sonya, where’ve you been? it’s strange that you’re late even for your father’s funeral. rodion romanovich, allow her to sit next to you. there’s your place sonechka . . . take whatever you want. have some of the jellied fish, that’s the best. soon there’ll be pancakes. have they fed the children? polechka, do you have everything over there? cough-cough-cough! well, all right. be a clever girl, lenya, and you, kolya, don’t kick your feet; sit like a well-behaved child. what are you saying, sonechka?” sonya hastened to convey petr petrovich’s apology, trying to speak loud enough so that everyone could hear and using the most carefully chosen respectful expressions, purposely composed by petr petrovich and embellished by her. she added that petr petrovich had specially ordered her to say that as soon as it became possible, he would come very soon to talk privately about business and to agree on what could be done and what to undertake in the future, etc., etc. sonya knew that this would pacify and reassure katerina ivanovna, flatter her, and—the main thing—her pride would be satisfied. she sat down next to raskolnikov, to whom she bowed hurriedly, and in passing cast an inquisitive glance at him. however, for the most part she avoided both looking at him and talking to him. she even seemed to be distracted, although she kept looking at katerina ivanovna’s face and tried to please her. neither she nor katerina ivanovna was dressed in mourning, because they lacked the clothes; sonya was wearing some sort of dark brown dress, and katerina ivanovna had on her only dress, a drab cotton dress with stripes. the news about petr petrovich was well received. katerina ivanovna heard sonya out pretentiously and, with the same pretentiousness, inquired about petr petrovich’s health. then, quickly and almost out loud, she whispered to raskolnikov that it really would be strange if a respected and solid man like petr petrovich would find himself in such “unusual company,” in spite of all his devotion to her family and his former friendship with her papa. “that’s why i’m especially grateful to you, rodion romanych, that you didn’t disdain my hospitality, even in such circumstances,” she added almost aloud. “however, i’m convinced that only your special friendship with my poor deceased husband inspired you to keep your word.” then she surveyed her guests again with pride and dignity and suddenly, with special solicitude, inquired loudly across the table of the deaf old man whether he’d like some more roast and had he been served some lisbon wine? the old man didn’t reply and for a long time was unable to understand what he was being asked, even though his neighbors began shaking him to amuse themselves. he merely looked around with his mouth open wide, which aroused general merriment. “what an oaf! look, look! why did they bring him? as far as petr petrovich is concerned, i was always certain of him,” katerina ivanovna continued to raskolnikov. “and, of course, he’s not like . . .” she said loudly and harshly, turning to amaliya ivanovna with an extremely stern expression,"
dostoevsky,"which caused the latter to cringe, “not like those overdressed tail draggers of yours who wouldn’t have been admitted as cooks into my papa’s kitchen; and my late husband, of course, would’ve done them a great honor receiving them, even though it was only out of his inexhaustible kindness.” “yes, ma’am. he loved to drink; he really loved it and he used to drink, ma’am!” the retired quartermaster cried suddenly, draining his twelfth glass of vodka. “indeed, my late husband did have that weakness, and everyone knew that,” said katerina ivanovna, pouncing on him in a flash. “but he was a kind and generous man who loved and respected his family; his one fault was that out of kindness he used to trust all sorts of depraved creatures; god knows who he used to drink with, people who weren’t even worth his shoe sole! just imagine, rodion romano­vich, they found a gingerbread rooster in his pocket: he was dead drunk, but he was thinking about his children.” “a roo-ooster? did you say a roo-ooster?” cried the quartermaster. katerina ivanovna didn’t deign to reply to him. she was deep in thought and sighed. “you probably think, like everyone else, that i was too strict with him,” she continued, turning to raskolnikov. “but that wasn’t the case! he respected me, he respected me very, very much! he was a man with a kind soul! i would sometimes feel so sorry for him! he used to sit in the corner looking at me, and i would feel so sorry for him; i wanted to be nice to him, and then i thought to myself, ‘i’ll be nice to him and then he’ll go out and get drunk again.’ only by being so strict was it possible to restrain him somewhat.” “yes, ma’am, he had his hair pulled, ma’am, more than once, ma’am,” roared the quartermaster again and poured another glass of vodka down his gullet. “never mind the hair pulling, but it might even be useful to sweep out some of those fools. i’m not talking about my late husband now!” katerina ivanovna replied to the quartermaster. the red blotches on her cheeks were growing brighter and brighter, and her chest was heaving more and more. another minute or so, and she’d be ready to make a scene. many people giggled; obviously, they found this pleasant. some people began poking the quartermaster and whispering something to him. clearly, they were eager to provoke the two of them. “all-low me to inquire what you’re referring to, ma’am,” the quartermaster began, “that is, on whose . . . honorable name . . . you were good enough just now to. . . . however, there’s no need! it’s nothing! widow! hey, widow! i forgive you. . . . i pass!” he said, and he downed another vodka. raskolnikov sat there and listened in silence and with disgust. he ate a bit, only tasting out of politeness the morsels katerina ivanovna kept piling onto his plate, and that he did only to avoid offending her. he stared intently at sonya. but she was becoming more and more agitated and anxious; she also foresaw that the feast would not end serenely; with apprehension she observed katerina ivanovna’s growing irritation. meanwhile, she knew that she herself was the main reason why both of the invited ladies had treated katerina ivanovna’s invitation so disdainfully. she’d heard from amaliya ivanovna herself that the mother had been offended by the invitation and had posed a question: “how could she possibly seat her own daughter next to that young woman ?” sonya foresaw that katerina ivanovna already knew about this somehow, and an insult to sonya meant more to katerina ivanovna than an insult to her personally, her children, or her papa—in a word, it was a mortal insult; sonya knew that katerina ivanovna wouldn’t calm down “until she had proved to these two tail draggers that they’re both . . .” and so on and so forth. as if on purpose, someone at the other end of the table sent sonya a plate depicting two hearts pierced by an arrow, all carved out of black bread. katerina ivanovna flared up and immediately remarked in a loud voice, across the table, that the person who’d sent it was, of course, a “drunken ass.” amaliya ivanovna, also foreseeing something unpleasant, while at the same time feeling offended to the depths of her soul by katerina ivanovna’s arrogance, in an effort to deflect the nasty mood of the company in another direction and, by the way, to elevate her own standing in the general opinion, suddenly began, for no good reason, to relate a story about an acquaintance of hers, “karl from ze pharmazist’s shop,” who was taking a cab one night and “ze driver vanted to kill him, und karl begt und begt not to kill him, und he vept und clasped ze hands, and vas frightened, and from ze fear his heart vas vounded.” although katerina ivanovna smiled, she remarked at once that amaliya ivanovna shouldn’t be trying to tell stories in russian. at that, amaliya ivanovna was even more offended and objected, saying that her “ vater from berlin vas a very, very important mann, and alvayz valked mit ze hends in ze pockets.” katerina ivanovna was so amused that she couldn’t refrain and burst into loud laughter, as a result of which amaliya ivanovna lost her last bit of patience and self-control. “look at that screech owl!” an almost cheerful katerina ivanovna whispered to raskolnikov again. “she was trying to say that he walked around with his hands in his pockets, but it came out that he picked other people’s pockets. cough, cough! and did you notice, rodion romanovich, once and for all, that all these petersburg foreigners—that is, mainly the germans—who come to us from somewhere or other are all stupider than we are? well, you have to agree that you can’t just say, ‘karl from ze pharmazist’s shop"
dostoevsky,"from ze fear his heart vas vounded,’ and that he (the snotnose!), instead of tying up the cabdriver, ‘he clasped ze hands, und vept, und begt.’ ah, what a nitwit! and she thinks it’s a very touching story, and doesn’t even suspect how stupid she is! in my opinion, this drunken quartermaster is much smarter than she is; at least it’s apparent that the profligate drank away the last of his brains, but they’re all so prim and proper. . . . just look at her: her eyes are popping out. she’s angry! very angry! ha-ha-ha! cough, cough!” having cheered up, katerina ivanovna was immediately distracted by various details and suddenly began talking about how, with the assistance of an obtained pension, she would definitely open a boarding school for noble young ladies in her home town of t——. raskolnikov had not heard of this plan before from katerina ivanovna, and she immediately delved into all the most alluring details. it was not at all clear how that “certificate of merit” had suddenly turned up in her hands, the one that the late marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov, explaining to him in the tavern that katerina ivanovna, his wife, had done the shawl dance “in the presence of the governor and other distinguished people” at the institute graduation ball. this certificate of merit, obviously, was now supposed to bear witness to katerina ivanovna’s right to establish a school; but the main thing was, it was kept in reserve with the goal of finally putting those “two overdressed tail draggers” in their place, in case they came to the funeral feast, and to demonstrate clearly to them that katerina ivanovna was descended from a noble, “one could even say aristocratic, household and was a colonel’s daughter, and that she was much better than certain adventure seekers who had become so very common as of late.” the certificate of merit was immediately passed around by the drunken guests, which katerina ivanovna did not prevent, because it really did indicate en toutes lettres that she was the daughter of a decorated court councillor, and as a result, almost in fact a colonel’s daughter. now inspired, katerina ivanovna soon enlarged on all the details of her future splendid and serene way of life in t——; about the gymnasium teachers she would invite to give lectures at her school; about a respectable old frenchman, m. mangot, who had once taught katerina ivanovna french in school and who was living out his years in t—— and would certainly agree to teach in the school for a very reasonable fee. finally the plan included even sonya, “who would accompany katerina ivanovna to t—— and there would assist her in everything.” but here someone at the other end of the table suddenly started chuckling. although katerina ivanovna tried to pretend that she disregarded the laughter at the end of the table, she immediately raised her voice and began animatedly describing sofiya semyonovna’s unquestionable abilities to serve as her assistant, “her gentleness, patience, self-sacrifice, nobility, and her education”; then she patted sonya on the cheek and, standing up, kissed her warmly twice. sonya blushed, but katerina ivanovna suddenly burst into tears, remarking that “she was a nervous fool and was too distraught, that it was high time she stopped, and since the meal was finished, it was now time to serve tea.” at that very moment amaliya ivanovna, now absolutely offended that she had taken not the least part in the entire conversation, and that others weren’t even listening to her at all, suddenly risked a last attempt and, with secret anguish, ventured to make one extremely practical and profound remark to katerina ivanovna, about how in her future school it would be important to pay particular attention to the girls’ clean undergarments ( die wäsche ) and that “she must haff one such good voman”—“ die dame ”—“who the linen lookt after,” and, second, “that all ze girls must at night secretly no novels read.” katerina ivanovna, who was really distraught and very tired and already fed up with the funeral feast, immediately snapped at amaliya ivanovna and said that she was “talking nonsense” and didn’t understand a thing; that die wäsche was the concern of the woman in charge of the linen, and not the director of a boarding school for noble young women; and as far as reading novels was concerned, that was simply indecent, and she asked her to keep quiet. amaliya ivanovna flushed; now angered, she remarked that “she visht ze best,” and that “she visht only ze very best,” and that katerina “for ze apartment had yet to pay ze rent.” katerina ivanovna immediately “put her in her place,” saying that she was lying when she said that “she visht ze best,” because as recently as yesterday, when the deceased was still lying on the table, she had pestered her about the rent for the apartment. to this amaliya ivanovna replied extremely logically that “she invited zose ladies, but zose ladies didn’t come because zose ladies were respectable ladies und couldn’t disreputable ladies visit.” katerina ivanovna immediately “emphasized” to her that since she was a slut, she couldn’t judge what genuine nobility really was. amaliya ivanovna wouldn’t accept this and declared at once that her “ vater from berlin vas a very, very important mann and valked mit ze hends in ze pockets and always said, ‘poof! poof!’ ” and in order to represent her vater more accurately, amaliya ivanovna jumped up from the chair, shoved both her hands into her pockets, puffed out her cheeks, and began making some sort of vague sounds with her mouth similar to puff, puff, to the accompaniment of loud guffaws from all the other lodgers, who intentionally encouraged amaliya ivanovna with their approval, expecting a fight. but katerina ivanovna could no longer stand it and rapidly, for all to hear, “blurted out” that perhaps amaliya ivanovna never even had a vater, that amaliya ivanovna was simply"
dostoevsky,"a drunken petersburg finn, and that most likely she had worked somewhere as a cook before, perhaps even worse than that. amaliya ivanovna turned red as a lobster and shrieked that perhaps katerina ivanovna “had no vater at all; that her vater vas from berlin, and he vore ze long frock coat und kept mit ze puff, puff, puff!” katerina ivanovna remarked with contempt that her own background was known to everyone and that the same certificate of merit indicated in print that her father was a colonel; while amaliya ivanovna’s father (if she even had one) was probably some poor petersburg finn who peddled milk; that most likely she didn’t have a father at all, because even up to now amaliya ivanovna’s patronymic was still unknown: ivanovna or lyudvigovna. then amaliya ivanovna, furious at last, banging her fist on the table, took to shouting that she was amal-ivan, and not lyu­dvigovna, that her vater “vas called johann und he vas ze burgmeister, ” † and that katerina ivanovna’s vater “vas never ze burgmeister .” katerina ivanovna stood up from her place and sternly, in an apparently calm voice (although she was completely pale and her chest was heaving deeply), remarked to her that if she dared “to compare for one moment her worthless vater ” with her own papa, that she, katerina ivanovna, “would tear off amaliya’s cap and trample it underfoot.” after hearing this, amaliya ivanovna ran around the room, shouting with all her might that she was the landlady and that katerina ivanovna “must zis very minute vacate the apartment.” then for some reason she rushed to collect her silver spoons from the table. an uproar and commotion ensued; the children began crying. sonya hastened to restrain katerina ivanovna; but when amaliya ivanovna suddenly yelled something about a yellow ticket, katerina ivanovna pushed sonya away and went after amaliya ivanovna to carry out her threat about the cap immediately. at that very moment the door opened and petr petrovich luzhin suddenly appeared on the threshold of the room. he stood regarding the entire company with a severe and attentive glance. katerina ivanovna rushed to him. * boiled rice with raisins and honey, traditionally eaten at a funeral repast. † “mayor” (german). oceanofpdf.com iii “p etr petrovich!” she cried, “at least you will protect us! make this stupid creature understand that she has no right to treat a respectable lady in distress that way. there are laws about such things. . . . i’ll go to the governor-general himself. . . . she’ll have to answer for it. in memory of my father’s hospitality, protect his orphans.” “excuse me, madam. . . . excuse me, excuse me, madam,” petr petrovich said, waving her away. “as even you must know, i didn’t have the honor of knowing your papa at all . . . excuse me, madam!” someone guffawed loudly. “and i’m not inclined to get involved in your endless quarrels with amaliya ivanovna, ma’am. . . . i came here on necessary business . . . and i wish to speak at once with your stepdaughter, sofiya . . . ivanovna. . . . that’s it, isn’t it? allow me to pass, ma’am . . .” petr petrovich, sidling past katerina ivanovna, headed to the opposite corner, where sonya stood. katerina ivanovna remained standing in the same place as if thunderstruck. she couldn’t understand how petr petrovich could disavow her papa’s hospitality. having once imagined this hospitality, she had come to believe in it as a sacred thing. she was also struck by petr petrovich’s dry, businesslike tone, even full of some contemptuous menace. everyone gradually fell somehow silent at his appearance. besides, this “businesslike and earnest” man seemed in such disharmony with the entire gathering; in addition, it was clear that he had come for something important, probably only some unusual reason could bring him into such company; therefore something was about to happen, something would occur. raskolnikov, standing next to sonya, stepped aside to let him approach; petr petrovich, it seemed, didn’t even notice him. a moment later, lebezyatnikov appeared on the threshold; he didn’t enter the room, but paused, also with some particular curiosity, almost in astonishment; he listened, though for a long time seemed not to understand anything. “excuse me if i’m interrupting, but i’ve come on rather important business, ma’am,” petr petrovich remarked to everyone in general, not addressing anyone in particular. “i’m even glad other people are here. amaliya ivanovna, i humbly request that you, in your capacity as landlady of this apartment, pay special attention to the conversation i’m about to have with sofiya ivanovna. sofiya ivanovna,” he continued, turning directly to an extremely surprised and already frightened sonya, “immediately after your visit to my friend andrey semyonovich lebezyatnikov, a government banknote belonging to me worth one hundred rubles disappeared from my table. if there is any way you know about it and can show us where it is now, then i give you my word of honor, which everyone here can witness, that will be the end of the matter. in the opposite case, i will be forced to take very serious measures, and then . . . you will have only yourself to blame, ma’am!” complete silence reigned in the room. even the crying children quieted down. sonya stood there, deathly pale, regarding luzhin, unable to utter any reply. it was as if she still didn’t understand. several seconds passed. “well, ma’am, how about it?” asked luzhin, staring at her intently. “i don’t know. . . . i don’t know anything . . .” sonya finally uttered in a weak voice. “no? you don’t?” luzhin repeated his question and was silent for several seconds. “think, mademoiselle,” he began sternly, as it were, still exhorting her, “consider carefully. i’m willing to give you more time to reflect. please understand, ma’am: if i were not so certain, with my experience, of course, i wouldn’t risk accusing you so openly; for such"
dostoevsky,"a direct and open, but false, even erroneous accusation, i would, in a certain sense, be held responsible. i know this, ma’am. this morning i exchanged, for some necessary expenses, several five percent bills with the nominal value of three thousand rubles. i have a receipt to that effect in my wallet. upon returning home, i—andrey semyonovich is my witness—began counting the money; after counting two thousand and three hundred rubles, i placed that sum in my wallet and then put my wallet in the side pocket of my jacket. about five hundred rubles in banknotes were left on the table; among them were three notes of one hundred rubles each. at that moment you arrived (at my request); all the while you were extremely agitated, so that three times in the middle of our conversation you even stood up and prepared to leave for some reason, even though the conversation had not yet ended. andrey semyonych can bear witness to all this. most likely, you yourself, mademoiselle, won’t refuse to confirm and declare that i asked you to come, through andrey semyonych, solely in order to talk about the orphaned and desperate situation of your relative katerina ivanovna (whose funeral dinner i was unable to attend), and about how it might be useful to organize something like a subscription, a lottery, or something similar, for her benefit. you thanked me and even shed some tears (i’m relating everything as it happened in order, first, to remind you and, second, to show you that not the smallest detail has been erased from my memory). i took a ten-ruble note from the table and gave it to you, on my own behalf, as a contribution for your relative and as the first form of assistance. andrey semyonovich saw all this. then i escorted you to the door—while you were still agitated—after which, left alone with andrey semyonovich, and conversing with him for almost ten minutes, he left and i turned back to the table where the money was lying, with the aim of finishing my counting and then putting it aside, as i had planned to do previously. to my surprise, a one-hundred-ruble note was not to be found among all the others. please think carefully: i can’t suspect andrey semyonovich, ma’am; i’m even ashamed of the suggestion. i can’t be making a mistake in the amount, because just before your arrival, i’d finished my counting and found the total correct. you’ll agree that recalling your agitation, your haste to leave, and the fact that for a while you had your hands on the table, and, finally, taking into account your social position and its associated habits, i was compelled, so to speak, against my will and with horror, to reach a conclusion—a cruel one, of course, but justified, ma’am! i will add, and i repeat, that in spite of all my evident certainty, i understand that there is still some risk for me in making this accusation now. but as you see, i haven’t left the matter unattended; i have risen up and will tell you why: solely, madam, solely because of your blackest ingratitude! what? i invited you to stop by in the interests of your poor relative; i gave you ten rubles as a contribution within my powers; and you, right here, are repaying me for everything with such an action! no, ma’am, this is not very nice, ma’am! a lesson is needed, ma’am. consider carefully; moreover, as your true friend, i ask you (since at this moment you don’t have a better friend than i) to reconsider! otherwise, i will be merciless! well, ma’am, how about it?” “i didn’t take anything from you,” sonya whispered in horror. “you gave me ten rubles; here, take them back.” she drew her handkerchief from her pocket, untied the knot, pulled out a ten-ruble note, and extended her hand to luzhin. “so you deny knowledge of the other hundred rubles?” he said reproachfully and insistently, not taking the note. sonya looked around. everyone was staring at her with such horrified, severe, mocking, hateful faces. she glanced at raskolnikov . . . he was standing near the wall, arms folded across his chest, regarding her with a fiery gaze. “oh, lord!” sonya burst forth. “amaliya ivanovna, we’ll have to inform the police; therefore i humbly request that you send for the caretaker,” luzhin remarked quietly, even politely. “ gott der barmherzige ! * i knew she vas a thief!” amaliya exclaimed, clasping her hands. “you knew?” luzhin repeated. “that means you already had some reason for coming to that conclusion. i beg you, most respected amaliya ivanovna, remember the words you just spoke here in the presence of witnesses.” loud conversation suddenly arose on all sides. everyone began stirring. “wha-a-at?” katerina ivanovna cried suddenly, coming to her senses—and, as if breaking loose, she rushed at luzhin. “what? you’re accusing her of theft? sonya? ah, what scoundrels, scoundrels!” rushing to sonya, she clutched her tightly in her wasted arms. “sonya! how dare you take ten rubles from him! oh, you stupid girl! give it to me! give me the ten rubles—here!” after snatching the banknote from sonya, katerina ivanovna crumpled it in her hand and hurled it straight at luzhin’s face. the ball of paper hit him in the eye and bounced onto the floor. amaliya ivanovna rushed to pick up the money. petr petrovich grew angry. “restrain this madwoman!” he shouted. just at that moment, several people appeared in the doorway together with lebezyatnikov, among whom were the two recently arrived ladies. “what? madwoman? i’m a madwoman, am i? you fool, you!” katerina ivanovna shrieked. “you’re a fool, a shyster, a vile creature! sonya, sonya steal his money? sonya, a thief? why, she’d even give you money, you fool!” katerina ivanovna began laughing hysterically. “have you ever seen such a fool?” she rushed around the room, pointing out luzhin to everyone. “what? and you, too?” she said, catching sight of the landlady."
dostoevsky,"“you, too, you german sausage-maker, you state that she ‘stole,’ you revolting prussian chicken leg dressed up in crinoline! oh, you! you! she hasn’t left this room; as soon as she returned, you scoundrel, she sat down right next to rodion romanovich! search her! if she didn’t leave the room, the money must still be on her! search her, go on, search her! but if you don’t find it, then, excuse me, my dear, you’ll have to answer for it! to the tsar, the tsar, i’ll go to the tsar himself, the merciful tsar; i’ll throw myself at his feet at once, today! i’m an orphan! they’ll admit me! you think they won’t? you lie! i’ll get to him! i will! you were counting on the fact that she’s timid, right? you were relying on that, were you? but, my friend, i’m fearless! you’ll pay for it! search her! search her, go on, search her!!” in her fury, katerina ivanovna grabbed luzhin and dragged him over to sonya. “i’m ready, ma’am, and will answer for it . . . but calm down, madam, calm down! i see all too well that you’re fearless! this . . . this . . . how to proceed, ma’am?” muttered luzhin. “the police should be present, ma’am . . . although, as it is, there are more than enough witnesses. . . . i’m ready, ma’am. . . . but in any case, it’s difficult for me as a man . . . because of my sex. . . . if, with amaliya ivanovna’s help . . . although, this isn’t the way it’s done. . . . how to proceed?” “anyone you like. let anyone you like search her!” cried katerina ivanovna. “sonya, empty your pockets! there, there! look, you monster, it’s empty; there was a handkerchief and now the pocket’s empty, you see! now the other pocket, there, there! you see? you see?” and katerina didn’t merely empty sonya’s pockets so much as grab both of them, one after the other, and turn them inside out. but from the second pocket, the one on the right, a piece of paper came flying out; describing a parabola in the air, it fell at luzhin’s feet. everyone saw it; many people cried out. petr petrovich bent over, picked up the paper from the floor with his two fingers, unfolded it, and lifted it up for all to see. it was a one-hundred-ruble banknote, folded in eighths. petr petrovich moved his arm around in a circle, displaying the banknote to everyone. “thief! get auss of zis apartment! police! police!” howled amaliya ivanovna. “zey muss to siberia be sent! get auss! ” exclamations flew from all sides. raskolnikov kept silent and didn’t take his eyes off sonya; from time to time he glanced quickly at luzhin. sonya stood in the same place, as if unconscious: she didn’t even seem very surprised. suddenly her entire face turned red: she cried out and covered her face with her hands. “i didn’t do it! i didn’t take it! i don’t know anything about it!” she cried in a heart-rending wail and rushed to katerina ivanovna. she embraced sonya and held her close, as if shielding her with her chest from everyone else. “sonya! sonya! i don’t believe it! you see, i don’t believe it!” cried katerina ivanovna (in spite of the clear evidence); she shook sonya in her arms like a child, kissing her repeatedly, catching hold of her hands and kissing them, too, almost devouring them. “even the idea of your taking it! what stupid people they are! oh, lord! you’re stupid, stupid,” she shouted, turning to face everyone. “you still don’t know, you don’t know, what sort of girl she is, what a heart she has! steal it? sonya? she would take off her last dress, sell it, go barefoot, and give it to you, if you needed it; that’s the sort of person she is! she got a yellow card because my children were dying of hunger; she sold herself for us! ah, her poor deceased father! her poor father! do you see? do you? so much for your funeral feast! good lord! protect her! why are you all standing there? rodion romanovich! why won’t you intervene? do you believe it, too? you’re not worth her little finger, all of you, all, all, all of you! good lord! defend her at last!” the lament of poor, consumptive, bereaved katerina ivanovna seemed to produce a strong effect on the public. there was so much pathos, so much suffering in her wasted, consumptive face distorted by pain, in her dried-out lips caked with blood, in her voice’s hoarse shrieking, in her sobs resembling a child’s complaint, in her trusting, childish, and, at the same time, desperate prayer for help that everyone seemed to pity the poor unfortunate woman. at least petr petrovich immediately pitied her . “madam! madam!” he cried in an imposing voice. “this matter doesn’t involve you! no one will accuse you of having the intention or of complicity, especially since it was you who discovered the banknote by turning her pockets inside out, which means you had no idea of it beforehand. i’m absolutely prepared to sympathize, if, so to speak, it was poverty that incited sofiya semyonovna. but why, mademoiselle, didn’t you want to confess? were you afraid of the disgrace? was it your first time? did you become flustered, perhaps? it’s understandable, ma’am, completely understandable, ma’am. . . . but why did you embark on such a course? ladies and gentlemen!” he turned to everyone present. “ladies and gentlemen! sympathizing and, so to speak, pitying, i may be ready to forgive, even now, in spite of the personal insults i’ve received. and let your present shame, mademoiselle, be a lesson to you for the future,” he said, turning to sonya, “and i shall leave the matter here; so be it, i’ll stop. enough!” petr petrovich cast a sidelong glance at raskolnikov. their eyes"
dostoevsky,"met. raskolnikov’s fiery look was ready to incinerate him. meanwhile, katerina ivanovna seemed not to hear anything more; like a madwoman she was embracing and kissing sonya. the children also embraced sonya from all sides with their little arms, while polechka—who didn’t quite understand what it was all about—seemed to be drowning in tears, shaking with sobs, burying her pretty little face, now swollen from her crying, into sonya’s shoulder. “how despicable!” a loud voice suddenly boomed from the doorway. petr petrovich glanced around quickly. “what baseness!” repeated lebezyatnikov, staring directly at him. petr petrovich actually seemed to shudder. everyone noticed this. (they recalled it later.) lebezyatnikov took a step into the room. “and you dared call me as a witness?” he said, approaching petr petrovich. “what does this mean, andrey semyonych? what are you talking about?” muttered luzhin. “it means you’re a slanderer, that’s what i’m saying!” lebezya­tnikov cried passionately, regarding him severely with his shortsighted little eyes. he was terribly irate. raskolnikov fixed his eyes on him, as if seizing on and weighing every word. silence prevailed once again. petr petrovich seemed almost at a loss, especially at first. “if you’re accusing me . . .” he began, stuttering. “what’s wrong with you? are you in your right mind?” “i am in my right mind, sir, and you . . . are a scoundrel! oh, this is so vile! i heard everything; i waited intentionally to understand it all, because, i confess, even up to this moment it hasn’t been quite logical. . . . but i don’t understand why you did all this.” “but what have i done? will you stop uttering your nonsensical riddles? perhaps you’ve been drinking?” “it’s you, you vile man, who may have been drinking, not me! i never touch vodka, because it’s against my principles! just think, it was he, he himself, who gave sofiya semyonovna that one-hundred-ruble note with his own hands—i saw it, i’m a witness, i’ll swear an oath! it was him, him!” repeated lebezyatnikov, turning to each and every person present. “have you gone mad or what, you pipsqueak?” cried luzhin. “right here in front of you—right here, just now, she confirmed to everyone that she received nothing from me but the ten rubles. how could i have possibly given her anything more?” “i saw it, i saw it!” shouted and affirmed lebezyatnikov. “although it’s against my principles, i’m prepared to swear any sort of oath in court this very minute, because i saw how you secretly slipped it into her pocket! but, fool that i am, i thought you gave it to her out of generosity! in the doorway, as you were saying good-bye, when she turned away and you were shaking her hand with your right hand, you secretly slipped the banknote into her pocket with your left. i saw it! i saw it!” luzhin blanched. “what lies you’re telling!” he cried valiantly. “and how could you, standing over by the window, tell that it was a banknote? you just imagined it . . . in your shortsighted way. you’re delirious!” “no, i didn’t imagine it! even though i was standing far away, i saw everything, everything, and even though from the window it was hard to make out a banknote—you’re right about that—by a special circumstance i know for certain that it was indeed a hundred-ruble banknote, because when you were just about to give sofiya semyonovna a ten-ruble note—i myself saw it—at the same time you took from the table a hundred-ruble note. (i saw it because i was standing nearby and the thought occurred to me just then; therefore, i didn’t forget that you had a banknote in your hand.) you folded it and held it tight in your hand all the while. then i almost forgot again, but when you went to stand up, you transferred it from your right hand to your left and almost dropped it; then i remembered the banknote once more because that same thought occurred to me again, namely, that you wanted to do something generous for her without my knowing. you can imagine how i began to follow things—and i saw how you managed to slip it into her pocket. i saw it, i saw it, and i’ll swear to it!” lebezyatnikov was almost gasping for breath. exclamations of various kinds rang out from all sides, most of them expressing astonishment; but there were also some exclamations that took on a more menacing tone. everyone crowded toward petr petrovich. katerina ivanovna rushed to lebezyatnikov. “andrey semyonych! i’ve been mistaken about you! protect her! you’re the only one who stands up for her! she’s an orphan; god has sent you! andrey semyonych, my dear friend, you kind man!” katerina ivanovna, almost unaware of what she was doing, threw herself on her knees before him. “nonsense!” wailed luzhin, enraged to a fury. “you’re talking nonsense, sir. ‘you forgot, you remembered, you forgot’—what’s all that about? so i planted it on her? why? for what reason? what do i have in common with this . . .” “what for? that’s just what i don’t understand myself; but what’s for sure is that i’m stating the facts! i’m so certain, you disgusting, wicked man, that i can recall precisely how that same question occurred to me just as i was thanking you, shaking your hand. why indeed did you slip it secretly into her pocket? that is, why secretly? was it really simply because you wished to conceal it from me, knowing that i hold opposite principles and reject private charity, which achieves no radical solutions? well, i decided that you were embarrassed to give away such a large sum in front of me. besides that, perhaps, i thought, you wanted to surprise her, astonish her when she found one hundred rubles hidden in her pocket. (because some benefactors very much like to show off their charity; i know this.) then it also occurred to me that you wanted to"
dostoevsky,"test her; that is, after finding it, would she come back to thank you? then, that you wanted to avoid her gratitude. what does it say there: so the right hand, isn’t it, doesn’t know . . . in a word, something like that. . . . well, a lot of different ideas occurred to me at that time, so i decided to consider it all later, but still i thought it indelicate to reveal that i knew your secret. however, one question occurred to me at the time: that sofiya semyonovna might lose the money before she noticed your good deed; therefore, i decided to come here, call her over, and inform her that one hundred rubles had been slipped into her pocket. on the way here, i dropped into the kobylyatnikovs’ to take them a general deduction from the positive method † and, in particular, to recommend an article by piderit (as well as one by wagner); then i came here, and what a scene i found in progress! well, how could i have had all these thoughts and ideas if i really hadn’t seen that you put one hundred rubles into her pocket?” when andrey semyonych finished his lengthy explanation, with such a logical conclusion at the end of his speech, he was terribly tired; sweat was even dripping from his face. alas, he didn’t really know how to express himself properly in russian (not knowing, however, any other language), so now he was suddenly utterly exhausted, as if he had even wasted away following his lawyerly feat. nevertheless, his speech produced an extraordinary effect. he’d spoken with such fervor, such conviction, that everyone apparently believed him. petr petrovich felt that things were not good. “what do i care if such foolish questions occurred to you?” he cried. “that’s no proof, sir! you could have dreamt all this raving in your sleep, and that’s all there is to it, sir! i tell you, sir, you’re lying! you’re lying and slandering me out of some malice toward me, out of anger that i don’t agree with your freethinking, godless social propositions, that’s what, sir!” but this latest turn didn’t work to petr petrovich’s advantage. on the contrary, grumbling resounded on all sides. “ah, so that’s where you’ve got to!” cried lebezyatnikov. “you’re lying! call the police, and i’ll swear an oath! there’s only one thing i don’t understand: why did you risk your reputation on such a vile act? oh, you pitiful, base man!” “i can explain why he took a risk on that act, and if necessary, i myself will take an oath!” raskolnikov spoke at last in a steady voice and stepped forward. he was apparently steady and serene. it somehow was clear to everyone, merely by glancing at him, that he really knew what it was all about and that the matter had reached its denouement. “now i’ve clarified it all to myself,” continued raskolnikov, turning directly to lebezyatnikov. “from the very beginning of this story, i’d already begun to suspect that there was some dirty trick involved, as a result of several special circumstances known only to me, which i’ll now explain to everyone: they embrace the whole point! it was you, andrey semyonych, with your valuable evidence, who clarified everything for me once and for all. i ask you all, all of you, to listen: this gentleman”—he pointed to luzhin—“was recently engaged to a young woman, namely, to my sister, avdotya romanovna raskolnikova. but upon arrival in petersburg two days ago, he quarreled with me at our first meeting and i drove him away, to which event there are two witnesses. this man was very angry. . . . the day before yesterday, i didn’t know he was renting a room here, from you, andrey semyonych; therefore, the same day we quarreled—that is, two days ago—he was a witness to how i, as an acquaintance of the late mr. marmeladov’s, presented his wife, katerina ivanovna, with some money for funeral expenses. he immediately wrote a note to my mother and informed her that i’d given the money not to katerina ivanovna, but to sofiya semyonovna; in addition, he made reference in the vilest language to her . . . her character, that is, he hinted at the nature of my relations with sofiya semyonovna. he did all this, you understand, with the goal of causing a rift between me and my mother and sister, convincing them that i was squandering their last kopecks, with which they were supporting me, for unworthy purposes. yesterday evening, in the presence of my mother and my sister, and in his presence, i established the truth after proving that i had given the money to katerina ivanovna for the funeral, and not to sofiya semyonovna, and that two days ago i was still unacquainted with her and had not even once seen her face-to-face. furthermore, i added that he, petr petrovich luzhin, with all his merits, wasn’t worth sofiya semyonovna’s little finger, about whom he’d expressed himself so offensively. to his question, ‘would i seat sofiya semyonovna next to my sister?’ i replied that i’d done so already, that very day. he grew angry that my mother and my sister, in spite of his slander, didn’t want to quarrel with me; word for word, he began to utter unforgivably impudent things to them. a definitive break occurred, and we drove him from the room. all of this occurred last evening. now i beg your particular attention: imagine if he were now able to demonstrate that sofiya semyonovna is a thief. first he would prove to my sister and my mother that he was almost right in his suspicions; that he had been justified in getting angry at me for having placed my sister on a level with sofiya semyonovna; that by attacking me, he was therefore defending and preserving the honor of my sister and his fiancée. in a word, through it all he could even provoke a"
dostoevsky,"rift between my family and me, and, of course, he hoped once more to restore himself to their good favor. i’m not even mentioning the fact that he’d get his personal revenge against me, because he would have the grounds to suppose that sofiya semyonovna’s honor and happiness were important to me. those were all his calculations! that’s how i understand this affair! that’s the whole reason; there can’t be any other!” raskolnikov finished his speech this way, or almost this way; he was frequently interrupted by exclamations from the listeners, who were, of course, paying great attention. but, in spite of all the interruptions, he spoke briskly, calmly, precisely, clearly, and decisively. his sharp voice, his persuasive tone, and his stern face produced an extraordinary effect on everyone. “yes, yes, that’s true!” lebezyatnikov affirmed in ecstasy. “it must be so, because as soon as sofiya semyonovna entered the room, petr petrovich asked me, ‘were you here? hadn’t i seen you among katerina ivanovna’s guests?’ he called me over to the window so he could question me in secret. therefore it was essential to him that you be here! it’s true, it’s all true!” luzhin remained silent and smiled contemptuously. however, he looked very pale. he seemed to be thinking about how he could extricate himself. perhaps he would have dropped the entire matter with pleasure and walked out, but at the present moment that was almost impossible; that would mean admitting the accuracy of the accusations against him—namely, that he really was slandering sofiya semyonovna. in addition, the people here, many of whom had already drunk a fair amount, were too agitated. the quartermaster, although he didn’t understand everything, was shouting more than anyone and proposed some very unpleasant measures against luzhin. but there were also some people who were not drunk; they came in from the other rooms and gathered together. all three of the little poles were terribly angry and were shouting constantly: ‘pan jest łajdak! ’ ‡ in addition, they were muttering still other threats in polish. sonya listened with effort, but also seemed not to understand everything, as if she were recovering from a fainting spell. but she didn’t take her eyes off raskolnikov, feeling that he was her best defense. katerina ivanovna was breathing with difficulty and wheezing; she seemed to be terribly exhausted. amaliya ivanovna stood there, looking the most foolish of all, her mouth open wide and without a thought in her head. she merely saw that petr petrovich had somehow been exposed. raskolnikov was about to speak again but wasn’t allowed to do so: everyone was shouting and crowding around luzhin with curses and threats. but petr petrovich didn’t cringe. seeing that his attempt to accuse sonya had failed completely, he resorted directly to effrontery. “allow me, ladies and gentlemen, allow me; don’t crowd me. allow me to pass!” he said, making his way through the crowd. “and be so kind as to stop your threats; i can assure that nothing will come of them; you won’t do anything. i’m not easily scared, sirs. on the contrary, ladies and gentlemen, you will be responsible for concealing a criminal act. the thief has been unmasked, and i intend to prosecute, sirs. the court will not be as blind . . . nor drunk, sirs, and they will not believe two acknowledged atheists, troublemakers, and freethinkers who are accusing me out of personal revenge, which, in their own stupidity, they even admit. . . . yes, sirs, allow me to pass!” “i want you out of my room at once; be so good as to leave, and everything between us is over! just think, i did my utmost, i’ve been explaining to him . . . for two whole weeks!” “i myself told you recently that i was leaving, andrey semyonovich, while you were still trying to detain me; now i’ll add simply that you’re a fool, sir. i hope you’ll be cured of your mental illness and your shortsightedness. allow me to pass, ladies and gentlemen!” he pushed his way through; but the quartermaster didn’t want to let him go so easily, with only verbal abuse: he grabbed a glass from the table, swung his arm, and hurled it at petr petrovich; but the glass flew directly at amaliya ivanovna. she screamed, but the quartermaster, who had lost his balance from the swing, fell clumsily under the table. petr petrovich passed into his room, and a half hour later was no longer in the building. sonya, who was timid by nature, had known beforehand that it was easier to demolish her than anyone else and that anyone could insult her almost with impunity. nevertheless, up to this very moment, it had seemed to her that she could somehow avoid misfortune—by her caution, meekness, and humility before each and every person. her disappointment was too painful. of course, she could tolerate everything with patience and almost without complaint—even this. but at first all this was too painful. in spite of her triumph and vindication—after the first fright and the passing of her stupor, when she had grasped and understood everything clearly—a feeling of helplessness and insult weighed painfully on her heart. she became hysterical. finally, unable to refrain, she rushed out of the room and ran home. this was almost immediately following luzhin’s departure. amaliya ivanovna, when the glass had hit her amidst sounds of loud laughter from those present, had also been unable to stand being made a scapegoat. with the shriek of a madwoman, she rushed at katerina ivanovna, holding her to blame for everything. “get auss of my apartment. right now. marsch! ” with these words she began grabbing hold of all of katerina ivanovna’s things she could lay her hands on and flinging them onto the floor. already almost completely exhausted, practically in a faint, pale and gasping for breath, katerina ivanovna jumped off the bed (where she had collapsed in exhaustion) and threw herself at amaliya ivanovna. but"
dostoevsky,"the struggle was too uneven; amaliya ivanovna pushed her away like a feather. “what? it’s not enough they’ve slandered me godlessly—now this creature’s attacking me! what? to be driven out of the apartment onto the street the day of my husband’s funeral, after all my hospitality, driven out with orphans! where will i go?” the poor woman howled, sobbing and panting. “good lord!” she cried suddenly, her eyes flashing. “is there really no justice? who’s supposed to defend us, poor widows and orphans? but we’ll see! there’s justice and truth on earth, there is, and i’ll find it! just you wait now, you godless creature! polechka, stay here with the children; i’ll come back. wait for me, even out on the street! we’ll see if there’s truth to be had on this earth.” throwing over her head the same lightweight green shawl the late marmeladov had mentioned in his account, katerina ivanovna squeezed through the disorderly drunken crowd of lodgers, who were still pushing into the room. she ran out onto the street with a tearful wail—and with the vague intention of finding justice somewhere, this very moment, no matter what. polechka, terrified, cowered with the children on a trunk in the corner, where, embracing the two little ones and trembling, she began waiting for her mother’s return. amaliya ivanovna rushed around the room, screaming, moaning, brawling, and flinging everything she could lay her hands on onto the floor. the lodgers were bawling, each doing his own thing—some were discussing, as best they could, what had just occurred; others were quarreling and cursing; still others struck up a song. “now it’s time for me to leave, too!” thought raskolnikov. “well, then, sofiya semyonovna, we’ll see what you have to say for yourself now!” and he set off toward sonya’s apartment. * “merciful lord!” (german). † a collection of articles translated from french and german and published in petersburg in . ‡ “the man is a scoundrel!” (polish). oceanofpdf.com iv r askolnikov was an active and bold advocate for sonya against luzhin, in spite of the fact that he carried so much of his own distress and suffering in his soul. but having endured so much that morning, he was glad for the chance to alter his focus, which had become so intolerable, not to mention the sincere and personal emotions in his desire to intervene for sonya. in addition, he had in view and at times felt terribly agitated about his forthcoming meeting with sonya: he felt obligated to tell her who’d killed lizaveta; he foresaw terrible suffering for himself, which he tried to push away. therefore, upon leaving katerina ivanovna’s, when he exclaimed, “well, then, sofiya semyonovna, we’ll see what you have to say for yourself now!” he was obviously still in an externally excited state of elation, occasioned by the challenge and recent victory over luzhin. but something strange happened to him. when he arrived at the kapernaumovs’ apartment, he felt a sudden weakness and fear. he stood in front of the door, deep in thought, with a strange question: “do i have to say who killed lizaveta?” the question was strange because he suddenly, just at that moment, felt not only that it was impossible not to say, but that it was impossible to put off this moment for even a little while. he still didn’t know why it was impossible; he merely felt it, and this tormenting awareness of his frailty before this necessity almost overpowered him. in order to cease his deliberations and to end his suffering, he opened the door quickly and looked at sonya from the threshold. she was sitting there, resting her elbows on the little table, covering her face with her hands; upon seeing raskolnikov, she stood up hastily and went to meet him, as if she were expecting him. “what would have happened to me without you?” she said rapidly, greeting him in the middle of the room. apparently she wanted to say this one thing to him as quickly as possible. that was why she’d waited for him. raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she had just stood up. she stopped a few steps away from him, just as she had yesterday. “well, sonya?” he said; suddenly he felt his voice trembling. “the whole matter depended on your ‘social position and its associated habits.’ did you understand that just now?” her face expressed suffering. “just don’t talk to me as you did yesterday!” she interrupted him. “please, don’t start. there’s enough suffering as it is . . .” she smiled quickly, afraid that he wouldn’t like the reproach. “it was foolish of me to leave. what’s happening there now? i wanted to go back at once, but i kept thinking that you’d . . . you’d come here.” he told her that amaliya ivanovna was driving them out of the apartment and that katerina ivanovna was rushing off “to look for justice.” “ah, my god!” sonya cried. “let’s go right now . . .” and she grabbed hold of her cape. “it’s always the same!” cried raskolnikov irritably. “they’re all you ever think about. stay here awhile with me!” “but what about . . . katerina ivanovna?” “ah, katerina ivanovna, of course, you can’t miss her. if she’s gone out of the house, she’ll come to see you herself,” he added peevishly. “if she doesn’t find you here, then it’ll be your fault . . .” sonya sat down on a chair in tormenting indecision. raskolnikov was silent, staring at the floor, thinking about something. “let’s assume that luzhin didn’t want to do it right now,” he began, without looking at sonya. “but what if he had wanted to or it had been part of his plans? he could have had you put in jail if lebezyatnikov and i hadn’t happened to be there! right?” “yes,” she said in a weak voice. “yes!” she repeated, distracted and alarmed. “and i really might"
dostoevsky,"not have been there! and lebezyatnikov? he turned up completely by chance.” sonya was silent. “and if you were taken to jail, what then? do you remember what i was saying yesterday?” once more she made no reply. he waited. “i thought you’d cry out again, ‘ah! don’t say it! stop!’ ” raskolnikov said with a laugh, but his laugh was somehow forced. “why this silence again?” he asked a moment later. “we have to talk about something, don’t we? i’d be interested in knowing how you would now resolve one ‘question,’ as lebezyatnikov says. (he seemed to get a bit muddled.) no, really, i’m being serious. imagine, sonya, that you knew all of luzhin’s intentions beforehand, you knew (that is, for certain) that as a result katerina ivanovna would come to grief, and the children; and you, too, in the bargain (since you consider yourself worthless, let’s say in the bargain ). polechka as well . . . because she’ll take the same road. well, then: suppose that suddenly all this depended on your decision: whether this person is to live, that is, should luzhin live and do nasty things, or should katerina ivanovna die? how would you decide: which of them has to die? i ask you.” sonya looked at him with anxiety: she heard something peculiar in his unsteady voice, which seemed to come from far away. “i had a feeling you’d ask me something like that,” she said, regarding him inquisitively. “all right, so be it; but how would you decide?” “why do you ask something so impossible?” sonya said with distaste. “that means it might be better for luzhin to live and do nasty things! surely you wouldn’t dare to decide that?” “but i can’t know god’s plan. . . . why are you asking something that’s so impossible? why pose such empty questions? how could it happen that it would depend on my decision? who made me a judge to decide who gets to live and who doesn’t?” “if god’s plan is mixed up in this matter, there’s nothing we can do about it,” raskolnikov grumbled sullenly. “tell me plainly what it is you want!” sonya cried, clearly suffering. “you’re leading up to something again. . . . did you really come here just to torment me?” she couldn’t restrain herself and suddenly burst into bitter tears. he looked at her in gloomy anguish. some five minutes passed. “but you’re right, sonya,” he said softly at last. he had in that moment been transformed; his artificially arrogant and weakly challenging tone had disappeared. even his voice suddenly slackened. “yesterday i told you that i’d come not to ask forgiveness, yet i almost began by asking for it. . . . what i said about luzhin and about god was for myself. . . . i asked forgiveness, sonya . . .” he began to smile, but there was something feeble and incomplete in his pale smile. he bent his head down and covered his face with his hands. at once a strange, unexpected sensation of some scathing hatred for sonya passed through his heart. as if surprised by this sensation and frightened by it, he suddenly raised his head and stared directly at her; he met her anxious and painfully solicitous glance directed at him; there was love reflected in it; his hatred vanished like a shadow. that was not it; he had mistaken one feeling for another. it only meant that the moment had come. once more he covered his face with his hands and bent his head down. suddenly he grew pale, stood up from his chair, looked at sonya, and, without uttering a word, sat down automatically on her bed. this moment in his feeling was terribly similar to the one when he’d stood over the old woman, after he had freed the axe from its loop and felt that “he had not a moment to lose.” “what’s the matter with you?” sonya asked, feeling extremely frightened. he couldn’t utter a word. this was not at all the way he had planned to announce it; he himself didn’t understand what was happening to him. she approached him gently, sat down on the bed next to him, and waited, without taking her eyes off him. her heart was pounding and skipping beats. it became unbearable: he turned his deathly pale face toward her; his lips twisted helplessly, trying to utter something. terror passed through sonya’s heart. “what’s the matter with you?” she repeated, withdrawing slightly from him. “nothing, sonya. don’t be afraid. . . . it’s all rubbish. really, if you think about it—it is rubbish,” he muttered with the look of a person unaware of himself and in delirium. “why in the world did i come to torment you with this?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “really. why? i keep posing that question to myself, sonya . . .” perhaps he had even posed this question to himself a quarter of an hour ago, but now he uttered it in complete helplessness, hardly aware of himself and feeling constant tremors throughout his whole body. “oh, how you torment yourself!” she uttered, with feeling, looking intently at him. “it’s all rubbish! . . . that’s what, sonya.” suddenly he smiled for some reason, a pale and feeble smile, for a few seconds. “do you remember what i wanted to tell you yesterday?” sonya waited anxiously. “as i was leaving, i said that i might be saying good-bye to you forever; but if i came today i would tell you . . . who killed lizaveta.” all at once her whole body shuddered. “well, then, i’ve come to tell you.” “so yesterday you were really . . .” she whispered with effort. “how do you know?” she asked quickly, as if coming to her senses suddenly. sonya’s breathing became labored. her face grew paler and paler. “i know.” she was silent for a minute. “did they find him ?” she asked timidly."
dostoevsky,"“no, they didn’t.” “so how do you know about it?” she asked, barely audibly, once again after almost a minute’s silence. he turned toward her and stared at her very, very intensely. “guess,” he said with his previous twisted, feeble smile. convulsions seemed to pass through her whole body. “you’re . . . i . . . why are you . . . scaring me?” she asked, smiling like a child. “it must mean that i’m his close friend . . . if i know,” raskolnikov continued, staring steadfastly at her face as if he lacked the power to look away. “he didn’t want to . . . kill lizaveta. . . . he killed her . . . accidentally. . . . he only wanted to kill the old woman . . . when she was alone . . . and he came. . . . then lizaveta walked in . . . he was there . . . and he killed her.” another terrible minute passed. they both continued staring at each other. “so you can’t guess?” he asked abruptly, with the feeling that he was throwing himself down from a bell tower. “n-no,” sonya whispered, barely audibly. “take a good look.” as soon as he said this, once again a prior, familiar feeling all at once turned his soul to ice: he glanced at her and all of a sudden he seemed to see lizaveta’s face in hers. he clearly recalled lizaveta’s expression as he approached her with his axe and she retreated from him toward the wall, holding up her hand, childlike fear in her face. it was just like little children when they suddenly get frightened of something: they stare motionlessly and anxiously at what’s scaring them, they retreat and, stretching out their little hands, they get ready to burst into tears. almost the same thing was happening now with sonya: just as weakly, with the same fright, she looked at him for a while, and all of a sudden, stretching out her left hand, she gently pushed her fingers against his chest and slowly began standing up from the bed, moving farther and farther away from him, fixing her intense stare on him all the while. her horror was suddenly communicated to him: it was as if the same fright showed in his face; he began staring at her the same way, almost even with the same childlike smile. “have you guessed?” he whispered at last. “good lord!” burst forth from her breast with a terrible wail. she fell helplessly onto the bed and buried her face in the pillow. but a moment later she quickly raised herself up, moved swiftly toward him, seized his two hands, squeezing them tightly with her slender fingers, as if in a vise, and once more fixed her unmoving gaze on his face as if it were glued to it. with this last, despairing look she wanted to search for and find some last vestige of hope. but there was no hope; no doubt remained whatsoever; it was all true ! even afterward, subsequently, when she recalled this moment, she felt strange and full of wonder: why was it that she realized immediately at that time that there was no doubt? she couldn’t say, for example, that she foresaw something of this sort. meanwhile, now, as soon as he had said it, it suddenly seemed to her that it was just as if she had foreseen exactly that. “enough, sonya, enough! don’t torture me!” he begged her pitifully. this wasn’t at all the way he had planned to reveal it to her, but this was how it turned out. as if she were unaware of what she was doing, she jumped up; wringing her hands, she reached the middle of the room, but quickly returned and sat down next to him once again, her shoulder almost touching his. all of a sudden, as if pierced, she shuddered, cried out, and threw herself on her knees before him, not really knowing why she did so. “what have you done, what have you done to yourself?” she said desperately. jumping up from her knees, she threw herself around his neck, embraced him, and squeezed him tightly in her arms. raskolnikov recoiled and regarded her with a sad smile. “you’re so strange, sonya—you hug me and kiss me when i just told you about that. you don’t know what you’re doing.” “no, there’s no one more miserable than you in the whole world!” * she cried as if in a frenzy, without hearing his last remark; she burst into sobs as if hysterical. a long-unfamiliar feeling poured like a wave into his soul and instantly softened it. he didn’t resist it; two tears formed in his eyes and clung to his eyelashes. “so you won’t desert me, sonya?” he asked, regarding her almost with hope. “no, no; never and nowhere!” sonya cried. “i’ll follow you, i’ll follow you everywhere! oh, lord! . . . oh, i’m so unhappy! . . . why, oh, why didn’t i know you before? why didn’t you come sooner? oh, lord!” “i’ve come now.” “now! oh, what can be done now? . . . together, together!” she repeated as if distracted and embraced him again. “i’ll go with you to prison!” all of a sudden, he felt a convulsion and his previous, hateful, almost haughty smile appeared on his lips. “sonya, perhaps i don’t want to go to prison yet,” he said. sonya looked at him quickly. after her initial, passionate, tormenting sympathy for the unfortunate man, the terrible thought of the murder struck her once again. in his altered tone of voice she suddenly heard a murderer. she looked at him in amazement. she still didn’t know anything about it, neither why, nor how, nor what for. now all of these questions flooded into her mind. once again she didn’t believe it: “he’s, he’s a murderer! could that be possible?” “what’s this? where am i"
dostoevsky,"standing?” she asked, deeply perplexed, as if unable to come to her senses. “but how did you, you, a man like you . . . how did you decide to do this? . . . what is this?” “well, yes. to rob her. stop, sonya!” he replied wearily, almost even irritated. sonya stood as if thunderstruck, but cried out: “you were hungry! you did it . . . to help your mother? is that so?” “no, sonya, no,” he muttered, turning aside and hanging his head. “i wasn’t that hungry. . . . i really did want to help my mother, but . . . that’s not completely true. . . . don’t torment me, sonya!” she clasped her hands. “is this really, really all true? good lord, what sort of truth is it? who can believe this? . . . how then, how could you give away your last kopecks, but you killed to rob her! oh!” she cried suddenly. “the money you gave katerina ivanovna . . . that money. . . . good lord, could it have been that money . . . ?” “no, sonya,” he interrupted hastily. “it wasn’t that money, calm down! my mother sent me that money through a certain merchant; i received it when i was ill, the same day i gave it away. . . . razumikhin saw it . . . he took the money for me. . . . that was my money, my own, really mine.” sonya listened to him in bewilderment and tried with all her might to understand something. “as for that money . . . i don’t even know if there was any money there,” he added quietly, as if in deep thought. “i took the purse from her neck, a leather one . . . full, tightly packed. . . . i didn’t look in it; i must not have had time. . . . as for the items, some cuff links and chains—i buried those things and the purse the next morning in a courtyard on voznesensky prospect under a stone. everything’s still there.” sonya listened attentively. “well, then why . . . how did you say: to rob her, but you didn’t take anything?” she asked quickly, grasping at straws. “i don’t know. . . . i still hadn’t decided whether i would take the money or not,” he said, once more as if in deep thought; then, coming to his senses suddenly, he smiled quickly and briefly. “what nonsense i just blurted out, eh?” a thought flashed through sonya’s mind: “is he mad?” but she repressed it at once: no, it’s something else. she didn’t understand a thing, not one thing! “you know, sonya,” he said suddenly with inspiration. “do you know what i can tell you: if i’d merely killed because i was hungry,” he continued, emphasizing every word and regarding her enigmatically but sincerely, “then i would be . . . happy now! you should know that! “what do you care, what do you care,” he cried with actual desperation after a moment, “what do you care if i even confess now that i did something wrong? what do you care about this stupid triumph over me? ah, sonya, is that why i came to see you now?” sonya wanted to say something, but she kept silent. “that’s why i wanted you to come with me yesterday, because you’re all i have left.” “go where?” sonya asked timidly. “not to rob or murder, don’t be alarmed, not for that.” he smiled sarcastically. “we’re very different. . . . you know, sonya, only now, just this moment, did i understand: where i was asking you to go yesterday. yesterday, when i asked you to come with me, i didn’t know where myself. i asked you for one reason; i came for one reason: so you wouldn’t leave me. you won’t leave me, will you, sonya?” she squeezed his hand. “why, why did i tell her? why did i reveal it to her?” he cried in despair a moment later, regarding her with endless suffering. “you expect some explanation from me, sonya; you’re sitting there waiting, i see that; but what can i tell you? you won’t understand anything; you’ll merely be worn out with suffering . . . all because of me! just look, you’re crying and embracing me again—why are you embracing me? because i myself couldn’t endure it and came to unburden myself on someone else: ‘you’ll suffer, too, and it’ll be easier for me!’ can you possibly love such a scoundrel?” “can it be that you’re not suffering as well?” cried sonya. once again the same feeling, like a wave, flooded into his soul and softened him in a moment. “sonya, i have a wicked heart, take note of that: that can explain a great deal. i came to see you precisely because i’m wicked. there are others who wouldn’t have come. but i’m a coward . . . and a scoundrel! but . . . let that be! all this isn’t the point. . . . i must speak now, but i don’t know how to begin . . .” he paused and became thoughtful. “oh, we’re not like each other,” he cried again, “we don’t match. why, why did i come? i’ll never forgive myself for it!” “no, no, it’s good that you came!” sonya exclaimed. “it’s better for me to know! much better!” he looked at her with agony. “what if it really was that?” he said, as if he’d made up his mind. “that’s how it really was! here’s the thing: i wanted to become napoleon, that’s why i killed. . . . well, do you understand now?” “n-no,” sonya whispered innocently and timidly. “but . . . speak, go on! i’ll understand, i’ll understand everything in my own way !” she begged him. “you’ll understand? well, all right, we’ll see!” he fell silent and thought for a long time. “the thing is—i"
dostoevsky,"once posed this question to myself: what would happen, for example, if napoleon were in my place, and if, to begin his career, there was no toulon, no egypt, and no crossing mont blanc; † instead of all these beautiful and monumental things, there was merely some ridiculous old woman, a civil servant’s widow, who, moreover, must be killed so he could steal money from her trunk (for his career, do you understand?); well, would he dare to do it if there was no other way out? would he have been repulsed by the fact that it was too colossal and . . . and sinful? well, i’m telling you that i spent a terribly long time suffering over this ‘question,’ as a result of which i became extremely ashamed when at last i guessed (somehow all of a sudden) that not only wouldn’t he be repulsed, but it wouldn’t even have entered his head that this wasn’t colossal at all . . . and he wouldn’t even have understood one bit: what was there to be repulsed by? and if he had no other way open to him, he would have strangled her without letting her utter a sound, without even stopping to think! and so i . . . stopped thinking . . . and strangled her . . . according to the example of my authority. . . . that’s precisely how it was! do you find it amusing? yes, sonya, the most amusing thing of all may be that this was exactly how it was . . .” sonya didn’t find it amusing in the least. “it would be better if you told me directly . . . without examples,” she said even more timidly and barely audibly. he turned toward her, looked at her glumly, and took her hands. “you’re right again, sonya. this is all nonsense, almost all idle talk! you see: you know that my mother has almost nothing. my sister received an education by chance and is condemned to seek positions as a governess. all their hopes were placed on me alone. i was a student, but was unable to support myself at the university and was forced to leave it for a while. even if things would’ve dragged on like that, in ten or twelve years or so (if circumstances proved favorable), i could hope to become some sort of teacher or civil servant, with a salary of a thousand rubles. . . .” (he was speaking as if he had memorized these words.) “by that time, my mother would have withered away from worry and grief, and i still wouldn’t have had the chance to comfort her, and my sister . . . well, something even worse could have happened to her! who would want to spend his whole life passing things by, turning away from everything, forgetting his mother, and, for example, politely enduring insults to his sister? for what? merely to bury them and then acquire new responsibilities—a wife and children, and then leave them also without a kopeck or a crust of bread? well, well, so i decided, once i got the old woman’s money, to use it for my early years, so as not to torment my mother, to support myself at the university and for my first steps afterward—and to do all that broadly, radically, to start a whole new career and set out on a new, independent way of life. . . . well, well, that’s all there is to it. . . . of course, the fact that i killed the old woman—that was a bad thing. . . . well, that’s enough!” he had dragged himself in some sort of exhaustion to the end of his story and now hung his head. “oh, that’s not it, not it,” sonya exclaimed in anguish. “how could you. . . . no, that’s not right, not right.” “you yourself can see that it’s not right! but i told you sincerely, the whole truth!” “what sort of truth is that? oh, good lord!” “i merely killed a louse, sonya, a useless, vile, pernicious louse!” “that louse was a human being!” “even i know she wasn’t a louse,” he replied, looking at her strangely. “but i’m lying, sonya,” he added. “i’ve been lying for a long time. . . . this isn’t right at all; you’re telling the truth. there are other reasons, completely different reasons! . . . i haven’t talked to anyone for a long time, sonya. . . . my head aches very badly now.” his eyes burned with a feverish fire. he was almost beginning to rave; an anxious smile wandered across his lips. a terrible weakness showed through his agitated state of mind. sonya understood that he was tormented. her head also began spinning. and he was speaking so strangely: as if it were coherent, “but how? how could it be? oh, lord!” she wrung her hands in despair. “no, sonya, that’s not it!” he began again, suddenly raising his head as if struck and aroused again by an unexpected turn of thought. “that’s not it! it would be better . . . to suppose (yes! that would really be better!), to suppose that i’m proud, envious, wicked, loathsome, vengeful, well . . . and, perhaps, even disposed to madness. (let it all come out in one clean sweep! people mentioned madness before, i noticed!) i told you previously that i wasn’t able to support myself at the university. but do you know that i might even have been able to do so? my mother would’ve sent money for the required fees, and i could’ve earned enough for boots, clothes, and bread—most likely! there were lessons to give; i was offered half a ruble for each. razumikhin’s working! but i turned spiteful and didn’t want to do it. turned spiteful, precisely. (that’s a good phrase!) then, like a spider, i took refuge in my corner. you were in my lair, you saw"
dostoevsky,"it. . . . do you know, sonya, that low ceilings and cramped rooms oppress the soul and the mind! oh, how i hated that lair! and yet i didn’t want to leave it. i stayed there intentionally! i didn’t go out for days; i didn’t want to work, and didn’t even want to eat; i just lay there. if nastasya came and brought me food—i’d eat; if she didn’t bring anything—the day would pass; i didn’t ask for anything deliberately, from spite! there was no light at night; i lay there in the darkness because i didn’t want to earn money to buy candles. i was supposed to study, but i sold all my books; now there’s a thick layer of dust on the table covering my papers and notebooks. i much preferred to lie there thinking. i thought all the time. . . . i had such dreams, strange, diverse dreams; there’s no point in trying to tell you about them! but it was only when i started to imagine that. . . . no, that’s not right! once again i’m not telling the truth! you see, at the time i kept asking myself: why am i so stupid, what if other people are stupid and i know for sure that they are? don’t i want to be smarter than they are? then i found out, sonya, that if i waited for everyone to become smart, it would take much too long. . . . i discovered this would never happen, that people wouldn’t change, there’s no one to remake them, and it’s not worth the effort! yes, that’s true! that’s their law. . . . a law, sonya! it’s true! . . . and now i know, sonya, that he who’s strong of mind and spirit, he is their master! he who dares much is right in their eyes. he who can spit on most things is considered their lawgiver, and he who dares more than anyone, he’s the one most in the right! this is how things have always been and this is how they always will be! only a blind man can’t see this!” saying all this, even though raskolnikov was looking at sonya, he no longer worried about whether she would understand him or not. a fever had seized him completely. he was in a state of gloomy ecstasy. (it really was a long time since he’d had anyone to talk to!) sonya understood that this gloomy catechism had become his faith and his law. “that’s when i guessed, sonya,” he continued with enthusiasm, “that power is given only to the one who dares to bend down and pick it up. there’s only one thing that matters, only one: to be able to dare! it was then i conceived an idea, for the first time in my life, one that nobody had ever thought up before me! nobody! it suddenly became clear as day: how could it be that up to now not one person had dared or dares, while bypassing all this absurdity, simply to seize it by the tail and heave it to the devil? i . . . i wanted to dare and so i killed. . . . i only wanted to dare, sonya, and that’s the whole reason!” “oh, stop it, be quiet!” sonya cried, clasping her hands. “you’ve strayed from god, and god has struck you and given you over to the devil!” “by the way, sonya, when i was lying there in the darkness and imagining all these things, was that the devil who was misleading me? huh?” “stop it! don’t make fun, you blasphemer; you don’t understand a thing, not one thing! oh, lord! he won’t understand anything, not one thing!” “be quiet, sonya, i’m not making fun at all. i myself know that the devil was leading me astray. be quiet, sonya, be quiet!” he repeated gloomily and insistently. “i know it all. i’ve thought this through many times already and whispered it all to myself while i lay there in the darkness. . . . i argued it through with myself many times, to the very last detail: i know it all, everything! then i became so fed up with all this chatter, so very fed up! i wanted to forget everything and start all over again, sonya, and to stop chattering! do you really think that i went like a fool, without thinking? i went like a clever man, and that’s just what destroyed me! do you really think i didn’t know, for example, that if i started to ask and examine whether i had the right to take power, that meant of course that i didn’t have that right. or that if i posed the question, is a person a louse, then of course that person is not a louse for me, but is a louse for someone to whom that question never occurs and who acts without asking questions. . . . if i agonized for so long about whether napoleon would’ve advanced or not, then clearly i felt i was not a napoleon. . . . i endured all the torment of this chatter, sonya, and wanted to shake it all off my shoulders: i wanted, sonya, to kill without casuistry, to kill for myself, for myself alone! i didn’t want to lie about it, even to myself! i didn’t kill to help my mother—that’s nonsense! i didn’t kill to acquire the means and power to become a benefactor of humanity. that’s nonsense! i simply killed: i killed for myself, for myself alone. whether i became someone’s benefactor or else, like a spider, caught everyone in my web and sucked out all their vital juices—at that time it didn’t matter to me! . . . the main thing, sonya, was that i didn’t need the money when i killed; it wasn’t the money, so much as it was something else. . . . i know all this now. . ."
dostoevsky,". understand me: perhaps proceeding along the same path, i might never commit another murder. i had to find out something else; something else was urging me along. i had to find out then, and find out quickly, whether i was a louse like everyone else or a human being? could i overstep or not? dare i stoop and take power or not? am i a quivering creature or do i have the right . . .” “to kill? have the right to kill?” sonya clasped her hands. “oh, sonya!” he cried irritably. he was about to protest but remained contemptuously silent. “don’t interrupt me, sonya! i wanted to prove only one thing to you: that yes, it was the devil who led me astray then, but he later showed me that i didn’t have the right to act like that because i’m the same kind of louse as everyone else! he made a fool of me; that’s why i’ve come to you now! receive your guest! if i weren’t a louse, would i have come to see you? listen: when i went to the old woman then, it was only a test. . . . you should know that!” “and you killed! you killed!” “but how did i kill? is that how people kill? do people go to kill the way i did then? i’ll tell you sometime how i acted. . . . did i even kill the old woman? i killed myself, not the old woman! right then and there i did myself in, forever! . . . but it was the devil that killed the old woman, not me. . . . enough, enough, sonya, enough! leave me,” he cried suddenly in a feverish agony. “leave me!” he rested his elbows on his knees and squeezed his head tight in his palms. “what suffering!” burst forth from sonya in a tormented wail. “well, tell me what to do now!” he asked, lifting his head suddenly and looking at her, his face hideously distorted by despair. “what to do?” she cried, jumping up from her place; her eyes, previously full of tears, suddenly began to flash. “stand up!” (she grabbed him by the shoulder; he got up, looking at her almost in bewilderment.) “go at once, this very minute, and stand at the crossroads, bow down, and begin by kissing the ground that you’ve fouled; then bow down to the entire world, all four sides, and say aloud to everyone: ‘i killed!’ then god will send you life once more. will you go? will you?” she asked him, trembling in her whole body, as if in a convulsion; she had grabbed his hands and was holding them tightly in hers, directing her fiery gaze at him. he was amazed and even struck by her sudden enthusiasm. “are you talking about prison, sonya? do you mean that i have to denounce myself?” he asked glumly. “you must accept suffering and atone that way.” “no! i won’t go to them, sonya.” “but how will you live? what will you live with?” she cried. “is that possible now? how will you speak with your mother? (oh, what will happen to them now, what?) what am i saying? you’ve already forsaken your mother and sister. you’ve forsaken them, abandoned them. oh, lord!” she cried. “but he knows this all himself! how on earth, how can you live without anyone? what will become of you?” “don’t be a child, sonya,” he said softly. “what am i guilty of before them? why should i go? what will i say? all this is merely a phantom. . . . they themselves destroy millions of people and consider it a virtue. they’re liars and scoundrels, sonya! . . . i won’t go. what would i say: that i killed but didn’t dare take the money and hid it under a stone?” he added with a bitter smile. “they themselves will laugh at me; they’ll say i’m a fool for not taking it. a coward and a fool! they won’t understand a thing, not a thing, sonya, and they’re not worthy of understanding. why should i go? i won’t. don’t be a child, sonya . . .” “you’ll suffer and die suffering,” she repeated, stretching her arms toward him in desperate entreaty. “perhaps i’m still slandering myself,” he remarked glumly, as if in deep thought. “perhaps i’m still a human being, not a louse, and i rushed to condemn myself. . . . i’ll still fight a while longer.” a haughty grin appeared on his lips. “what a torment to bear! and for your entire life, your entire life . . . !” “i’ll get used to it . . .” he said grimly and thoughtfully. “listen,” he began a moment later, “enough crying; it’s time for action. i came to tell you that they’re looking for me now, they’re trying to catch me . . .” “ah!” screamed sonya, terrified. “why did you scream? you yourself said you wanted me to go to prison, but now you’re frightened? here’s the thing: i won’t give myself up. i’ll still struggle with them, and they won’t do a thing. they have no real evidence. yesterday i was in great danger and thought all was lost; today things have improved. all their evidence cuts two ways—that is, i can turn their accusations to my own advantage, do you understand? and i’ll do so because now i’ve learned how. . . . but they’ll certainly send me to prison. if it hadn’t been for one accidental occurrence, then perhaps they’d have sent me to prison today; perhaps they may still send me to prison today. . . . but that doesn’t mean anything, sonya: i’ll be there a little while and then they’ll release me . . . because they have no real proof and they won’t have, i give you my word. and it’s impossible to drag a man off with what they have. well, enough. . ."
dostoevsky,". i’m saying this so you know. . . . i’ll try to reassure my mother and sister so they won’t be frightened. . . . now my sister seems to be provided for . . . so is my mother, too. . . . well, that’s everything. but be careful. will you come to see me in prison when i have to spend time there?” “oh, i will! i will!” they sat side by side, miserable and dazed, as if they had been cast upon a deserted shore after a storm at sea. he looked at sonya and felt how much love was directed at him; strange to say, he suddenly felt oppressed and pained at being so loved. yes, it was a strange and horrible sensation! coming to see sonya, he felt that she was his only hope and his only way out; he thought he could divest at least a part of his torments. now, all of a sudden, when her entire heart was turned toward him, he felt and was aware that he had become immeasurably unhappier than before. “sonya,” he said, “it’d be better not to come see me when i’m in prison.” sonya made no reply; she wept. several minutes passed. “do you have a cross?” she asked suddenly and unexpectedly, as if she had just remembered. at first he didn’t understand the question. “no, probably not. here, take this one, it’s cypress wood. i have another one, a copper one; it was lizaveta’s. she and i exchanged crosses; she gave me hers, and i gave her my little icon. now i’ll wear lizaveta’s cross, and this one is for you. take it . . . it’s mine! it’s mine!” she urged him. “we’ll go suffer together, we’ll bear our crosses together!” “give it to me!” said raskolnikov. he didn’t want to distress her. but at once he withdrew the hand he had extended to take the cross. “not now, sonya. it’d be better later,” he added, to appease her. “yes, yes, that would be better, much better,” she responded with feeling. “when you accept your suffering, then you’ll wear it. come to see me and i’ll put it on you; we’ll pray and go together.” at that moment, someone knocked on the door three times. “sofiya semyonovna, may i come in?” a very familiar voice asked politely. sonya rushed to the door in a fright. lebezyatnikov’s blond head glanced into the room. * the russian indicates a significant change in sonya’s speech from the formal vy (“you”) to the informal ty . † references to napoleon’s significant military victories and audacious crossing of mont blanc. oceanofpdf.com v l ebezyatnikov looked uneasy. “i’ve come to see you, sofiya semyonovna. excuse me. . . . i thought i might find you here,” he said, turning suddenly to raskolnikov. “that is, i didn’t think anything . . . like that . . . but i did think. . . . katerina ivanovna’s lost her mind,” he blurted out suddenly to sonya, turning away from raskolnikov. sonya screamed. “that is, it seems to be the case. however. . . . we don’t know what to do, that’s what! she came back—it seems she was driven away from somewhere, and perhaps she was even beaten . . . it seems that way, at least. . . . she ran to semyon zakharych’s superior, but he wasn’t home; he was having dinner with another general. . . . just imagine, she rushed to where they were eating . . . to the other general, and imagine—she insisted on calling semyon zakharych’s superior, yes, it seems, calling him away from the table. you can imagine what occurred there. of course, they chased her away; but she herself says she abused him and threw something at him. one can even imagine the scene. . . . i don’t understand why they didn’t arrest her! now she’s telling this to everyone, including amaliya ivanovna, but it’s hard to understand her; she’s shouting and thrashing about. . . . oh, yes: she’s talking and shouting that since everyone’s deserted her now, she’ll take the children and go out onto the street with a barrel organ; the children will sing and dance, and she will, too; they’ll collect money and go to the general’s window to play every day. . . . ‘let him,’ she says, ‘let him see how the well-born children of their father who was a civil servant now go begging in the streets!’ she’s beating the children and they’re crying. she’s teaching lyonya to sing ‘the little hut,’ and teaching her little boy to dance, polina mikhailovna, too, and she’s tearing their clothes; she’s making them little caps like the ones actors wear; she herself wants to carry a washbasin and beat time instead of making music. . . . she won’t listen to anything. . . . just imagine what it’s like! it’s simply impossible!” lebezyatnikov would have gone on, but sonya, who had been listening to him, hardly daring to breathe, suddenly grabbed her cloak and hat and ran out of the room, dressing as she went. raskolnikov ran out after her, and lebezyatnikov followed. “she’s surely gone mad!” he kept telling raskolnikov as they emerged onto the street. “i merely didn’t want to frighten sofiya semyonovna, so i said ‘it seems,’ but there’s no doubt. they say that in consumption there are little tubercles that invade the brain; it’s a pity that i don’t know anything about medicine. i tried, however, to dissuade her, but she won’t listen to a thing.” “did you talk to her about tubercles?” “that is, not exactly about tubercles. besides she wouldn’t have understood anything. what i mean is this: if you convince someone logically that in essence they have nothing to cry about, they’ll stop crying. that’s clear. is it your belief that they won’t stop?” “it would be too easy to live like that,” replied raskolnikov. “as you please, just"
dostoevsky,"as you please; of course, katerina ivanovna would find it rather difficult to understand; but are you aware that in paris they’ve already conducted serious experiments regarding the possibility of treating the insane, using only logical persuasion? one professor there, who died not long ago, a very serious scholar, formulated that it was possible to cure people. his main idea is that the insane have no particular derangement of their organism, but that insanity is, so to speak, a logical error, an error in judgment, an incorrect view of things. he gradually contradicted his patient and, just imagine, they say he achieved results! but since he was also using cold showers while doing this, the results of this treatment can naturally be subject to question. . . . at least, that’s the way it seems . . .” raskolnikov had long since stopped listening. having drawn even with his building, he nodded to lebezyatnikov and turned into the courtyard. lebezyatnikov came to, looked around, and ran on ahead. raskolnikov entered his little room and stood in the middle of it. “why had he come back here?” he looked around at the worn yellowish wallpaper, at the dust, his couch. . . . some sort of sharp, continuous knocking sound could be heard in the courtyard; something somewhere was being hammered, some sort of nail. . . . he went over to the window, stood on his tiptoes, and for a long time surveyed the courtyard with extraordinary attention. but the courtyard was deserted, and no one could be seen knocking. on the left, in the building’s wing, there were a few open windows; pots of straggly geraniums stood on the windowsills. laundry was hanging outside the windows. . . . he knew all this by heart. he turned away and sat down on the couch. never, never before had he felt himself so terribly alone. yes, once again he felt that he might really come to hate sonya, precisely now, when he had made her even unhappier. why had he gone to seek her tears? why was it so necessary for him to ruin her life? “oh, how vile!” “i’ll stay alone!” he said suddenly and decisively; and she won’t visit me in prison!” about five minutes later, he raised his head and smiled strangely. a strange thought occurred to him suddenly: “perhaps it would really be better in prison.” he didn’t remember how long he sat there, his head swarming with vague ideas. all of a sudden the door opened and avdotya romanovna walked in. at first she stopped and regarded him from the threshold, as he had looked at sonya before; then she came in and sat opposite him on a chair, the same place she had been sitting yesterday. he looked at her in silence and without any particular thoughts. “don’t be angry, brother; i’ve come for only a few minutes,” dunya said. her expression was thoughtful, but not stern. her gaze was clear and calm. he saw that this woman had also come to him in love. “brother, now i know everything, everything . dmitry prokofich told me and explained everything. you’re being pursued and tormented on a stupid, foul suspicion. . . . dmitry prokofich told me that there’s no danger and that you shouldn’t be so dismayed by it. i don’t agree with him; i understand completely how outraged you are at everything and how this indignation might leave its traces on you forever. that’s what i’m afraid of. i don’t judge you, nor dare i, for having deserted us; forgive me for having reproached you previously. i myself feel that if i had such deep unhappiness, i too would want to get away from everyone. i won’t say a word to our mother about this, but i’ll talk about you constantly and tell her you’ll come to see her very soon. don’t worry about her; i’ll calm her down; but don’t torment her—come just once; remember, she’s your mother! and now i’ve come merely to say”—dunya began to stand up—“that if, by any chance, you need me or will need me for anything . . . my whole life, or anything . . . just call me and i’ll come. good-bye!” she turned abruptly and headed for the door. “dunya!” raskolnikov stopped her, stood up, and went to her. “this razumikhin, dmitry prokofich, is a very fine man.” dunya blushed slightly. “well!” she asked, after waiting a minute. “he’s a practical man, hardworking, honest, and capable of loving deeply. . . . good-bye, dunya.” dunya blushed fully, then suddenly became anxious: “what’s this, brother, are we parting forever that you’re . . . giving me such instructions?” “it doesn’t matter. good-bye.” he turned and moved away from her, over to the window. she stood there, looking at him uneasily, and then left in alarm. no, he was not being cold to her. there was one moment (the very last one) when he’d desperately wanted to embrace her tightly and say good-bye to her, even to tell her, but he couldn’t resolve even to take hold of her hand: “afterward she might shudder when she recalls that i embraced her now, and she’d say i stole her kiss.” “will this one endure it or not?” he wondered to himself after a few minutes. “no, she won’t endure it; such people are unable to endure something like this ! people like her never endure it . . .” then he thought about sonya. fresh air wafted in through the window. the light was no longer so bright in the courtyard. he suddenly took his cap and left. of course, he was unable and didn’t even want to worry about his unhealthy condition. but all of this constant anxiety and mental anguish couldn’t pass without consequences. if he weren’t still lying there in a real fever, then perhaps it was precisely because this constant inner anxiety was keeping him on his feet for the time being"

(tina turner's album ""private dancer"" even included a song written by david bowie entitled , replete with menacing references to mind-control and cruelty, which conveyed the vague but frightening premonition of a frigidly-controlled future, as apprehended by those to whom is a date in the remote but recent past.) in the less distant past, these books used to be banned in every country under communist rule, and are still occasionally suppressed in the remaining single-party despotisms that disfigure the globe as i write, while animal farm is sometimes forbidden reading in the islamic world—because of its focus on pigs. even as i began to write this introduction, a stage version of animal farm was being produced by a bold theater group in beijing, where the novel itself is still officially unobtainable. so wide and so secure is orwell's reputation, in other words, that it can be shocking to realise that both of his masterpieces were very nearly aborted or strangled at birth. animal farm was almost denied publication, and had to be finished in a terrible, desperate burst of energy on the part of a man who knew that he was dying. probably nothing would have surprised their author more than the near-orthodox esteem in which his last two novels are now held: he never in his life expected to be ""required reading"" in respectable schools. the continuing censorship would have surprised him much less. animal farm was written during the second world war, at a time when london was being bombed by the nazis and churchill's britain was an official friend of stalin's russia. orwell despised hitler and fascism and had fought and been wounded as a volunteer soldier for the spanish republic, but he chose this unpropitious moment to write a deadly satire on the illusion of soviet communism. the original manuscript had to be dug out, in a somewhat scorched and crumpled state, from the ruins of orwell's blitzed north london home. in this condition, it was sent to t. s. eliot, the author of the waste land, who occupied the extremely influential position of editor at faber and faber. eliot was a political and cultural conservative of the determined right, and might have been presumed sympathetic to an anti-stalinist project. but he turned the book down in a letter of extreme condescension which described it as ""generally trotskyite."" this was, bizarrely enough, the same objection that had been made by orwell's leftist opponents. a senior official in the british ministry of information named peter smollett made it his business to warn publishers against accepting the book. his ostensible rationale was that josef stalin was an ally of great britain, and that it would be tactless to publish a satire upon him. the likelihood that the red army would have stopped fighting hider in for this reason was clearly not very great, but conformist and loyalist opinion is always easy to elicit and the evidence that publisher jonathan cape, for example, dropped the book on smollett's instigation is very strong. (smollett himself was later exposed as an agent of the soviet secret intelligence, whose job was to defend the prestige of stalinism rather than to support the war effort.) other publishers like victor gollancz—a leftist sympathiser who had printed earlier orwell works—needed no persuasion in denying him an audience for the twentieth century's most successful satire. in the end, the small house of seeker and warburg agreed to publish animal farm in a very small edition, for an advance of forty-five english pounds (or $, expressed in today's value). however, a group of ukrainian socialists, living in refugee camps in post-war europe, got hold of a copy of the book and immediately understood its profound relevance. they contacted orwell, who agreed to write the only introduction to animal farm that he ever composed, and who gave them the right to reprint the work in the ukrainian language, for free. this edition was distributed among refugees in germany, but most copies were seized by the american military authorities (this, well after the war against hitler was over) and handed over to the red army to be burned. in the united states, the book fared somewhat better. though it was originally refused by the dial press on the absurd grounds that animal stories did not sell"
orwell,"well in america, and though it was declined by angus cameron of random house after arthur schlesinger, jr., had sent him a copy (cameron was a leading communist fellow-traveler), it did eventually see print, from harcourt, brace, in . by that time, orwell had only a few years to live and was to exhaust himself physically and mentally by writing and then typing out . the contrast between the two books is an extraordinary one, which partly reflects orwell's own race against time. animal farm, with its original tongue-in-cheek subtitle ""a fairy story,"" is biting but essentially good-natured. the pastoral setting has a reassuring patina; mr jones, the wicked farmer, is also a figure of farce. the fate of some creatures, most obviously the noble work-horse boxer, has additional pathos and tragedy—in boxer's case because of his dumb, equine bravery—but the pigs are the pigs and they are amusing as well as nasty in their anthropomorphism. (many children have enjoyed the book for its own sake, heedless of the history of the soviet union and its ruthless, witless collectivisation, and martin amis in money has a hilarious passage in which his dumb-ox of a narrator, john self, is given a copy of the novel and laboriously makes the self-same mistake.) in , by contrast, orwell made extensive and almost melodramatic use of his own buried knowledge of cruelty. in his life, he had witnessed sadistic and authoritarian behavior among small boys at english boarding-schools, again while serving as a policeman in colonial burma and further as a journalist pretending to be a loser in slums and sweatshops. he had also gained first-hand experience of political terror as a fighter against both fascism and stalinism in spain. the novel makes a double-distillation of every nightmare of monstrous entrapment and powerlessness to which the average human brain is vulnerable. it also makes an almost conscious attempt to destroy the very concept of hope. those who read it first, like its original publisher fredric warburg, were made physically afraid. i still come across students in their twenties who were terrified by their initial reading. the original title of the novel was the last man in europe, as if to summarise the utter loneliness and despair of winston smith, but it was a stroke of genius that changed this into the almost hieroglyphic title—often rendered in numbers rather than in orwell's words—that we know today. no more than an inversion of the year in which it was being completed, the date gave an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule. this time, no outright attempt at censorship was undertaken. instead, there were efforts to make the novel into something that it was not. the book-of-the-month club in the united states, for example, asked that the passages of emmanuel goldstein's ""theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism"" be dropped—because they, too, were too ""trotskyist"" as well as too dense. orwell declined this demand, at the risk of losing a highly lucrative promotion. he also issued a written statement repudiating those who interpreted or conscripted the novel as an attack on the socialist movement in general. having known continuous neglect and suppression because of his principles, he was to experience a final, closing moment of literary success partly because of those who wished to use his principles against him. having set in england, in order, as he put it, to show that the english were no better than anyone else and that the totalitarian danger existed everywhere, he was in a strong position to appreciate the irony of this exploitation. a later cia-sponsored cartoon-film of animal farm, produced for purposes of cold war propaganda, cut out the closing passage about the restoration of farmer jones as head of the farm. that chapter just did not, for immediate practical purposes, quite ""fit"" the needs of the agency. this makes the same point in a slightly different way. despite being set in england, the book is obviously drawn from orwell's literary knowledge of russia and of the soviet union. the manipulation of numbers by the authorities (most famously the party's ability to insist that two and two can if necessary make five) is anticipated in dostoyevsky's notes from underground. and evgeny zamyatin's we, an early dystopian fantasy written in the early years of communism, was among orwell's acknowledged inspirations. during the hideous period of stalin's ""five year plan,"" it was at one point claimed by the authorities that the goal of the plan had been attained early, in two heroic two-year spurts. this huge lie was sometimes rendered for the stupider believers as + = . orwell's novel is full of meaningless announcements about the continuous achievement of ridiculous ""production targets,"" which form a sort of background noise to the drabness and scarcity of daily life. it was details like this which won orwell a tremendous literary compliment that he didn't live to see. today, czeslaw milosz is the acknowledged literary laureate of his native poland. but in , he was a minor cultural official in recently stalinised warsaw and experiencing the first stirrings of dissent. in his incisive book the captive mind, which was eventually published in , he wrote about his fellow heretics within the apparatus: a few have become acquainted with orwell's ; because it is both difficult to obtain and dangerous to possess, it is known only to certain members of the inner party. orwell fascinates them through his insight into details they know well, and through his use of swiftian satire. such a form of writing is forbidden by the new faith because allegory, by nature manifold in meaning, would trespass beyond the prescriptions of socialist realism and the demands of the censor. even those who know orwell only by hearsay are amazed that a writer who never lived in russia should have so keen a perception into its life. so—orwell writes a book that is published in . his novel describes a secret book that is circulated clandestinely within an ""inner"
orwell,"party."" and within two years, it is itself being passed secretly from hand to hand, by members of an inner party.... i am writing these words in january , the first month of orwell's centenary year. (he only lived to see the first half of the twentieth century, dying in january of .) as i write, all political discussion is dominated by an impending confrontation with two totalitarian states—iraq and north korea. in these countries, absolute power is held by leaders who demand incessant worship of themselves. membership of a party—the iraqi ba'ath party or the workers party of korea—is a prerequisite for access to power at any level of the army or the police. total control is exercised over all forms of printing and communication. the citizen is unambiguously the property of the state and can be tortured or murdered or made to ""disappear"" on a whim. in each case, a nationalist form of collectivist socialism is the ruling ideology, though in the service of an individual caligula. i have visited both of these states and seen their ""hate"" parades, their youth rallies, their round-the-clock cult of the big brother and their exaltation of force and cruelty. in each case, my fellow writers and i had little choice but to employ the term ""orwellian"" to describe what we had seen. we knew it was a bit of a cliche, in other words, but we also knew that it could not be improved upon. in a lesser way than milosz, and at much less risk, we too pay our compliments. it is also true that orwell warned against militarisation, especially in its nuclear form, wherever it occurred. (it's not often pointed out that the slave society he evokes in has been created in part by the misery that follows a short atomic war.) there is no doubt that orwell meant his work to put people on guard against chauvinism and regimentation and hysteria in all their forms: he was highly suspicious of the emerging cold war system of competing superpowers who might use the excuse of each other's existence to impose their will at home and abroad. and in the united states, which has recently taken extraordinary measures in its fight against theocratic nihilism, the excesses of ""homeland security"" and ""total awareness,"" with their new bureaucratic vocabulary, have also led people to reach for the expression ""orwellian."" this, again, is a tribute to his persistent relevance. the insistence upon the importance of language, and of the danger posed by sloganised thinking and official idiom, is among the debts we owe to orwell. in ""the principles of newspeak,"" an appendix to , the author quotes jefferson's preamble to the declaration of independence—""we hold these truths to be self-evident...""—as an instance of something that would be quite impossible to re-cast in newspeak terminology. long may this incompatibility continue and be upheld. neither of these two novels is faultless in historical terms. to take one example that is so glaring that few people notice it, there is no lenin either in animal farm or . there is a stalin figure in each—napoleon and big brother respectively—and a trotsky figure in each—snowball and goldstein—but a whole phase of history and indeed of allegory seems to have been skipped. we have no means of knowing what orwell intended by this astonishing omission, of which he may only have been semi-conscious himself, but it seems probable that he regarded the self-immolation of communism to have been at least partly a great tragedy, as well as a great crime. it was this insight and this perspective that allowed him to re-create the mental atmosphere so hauntingly. it is also this imaginative gift that posthumously made him one of the moral heroes of the revolution of in eastern europe, and of those who led it. it will, one day, give him the same eminence in china and north korea. having been among the bullies and among the bullied at different times of his life, orwell had an innate understanding of what nietzsche called the ""master-slave"" relationship. he knew that there are guilty thrills to be obtained from domination, and he also realised what few people fully appreciate—that there are also guilty thrills to be had from subjecting and abasing oneself. these books can be read, independently of their time and place, as a strong preventive medicine against the mentality of servility, and especially against the lethal temptation to exchange freedom for security: a bargain that invariably ends up with the surrender of both. i have dwelt somewhat on the circumstances in which these works were written and published, because they illustrate another point. it took courage, physical and moral, to write these books and to fight for their right to be read. orwell's life was a struggle in which the distance between what he said and what he meant was as near to nil as made no difference. he was a participant as well as a witness. he suffered a good deal in making the discovery, but he has assisted us in realising that, while the drive to power and corruption and cruelty is certainly latent in human beings, the instinct for liberty is innate as well. this battle takes place within ourselves as well as in the world we inhabit, and these books are weapons of self-respect as well as of self-defense. c hristopher h itchens washington, d.c. january , animal farm m r. j ones, of the manor farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. with the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where mrs. jones was already snoring. as soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all"
orwell,"through the farm buildings. word had gone round during the day that old major, the prize middle white boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. it had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as mr. jones was safely out of the way. old major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was willingdon beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say. at one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. he was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. first came the three dogs, bluebell, jessie, and pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. the hens perched themselves on the windowsills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. the two cart-horses, boxer and clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. a white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. after the horses came muriel, the white goat, and benjamin, the donkey. benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. he seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark—for instance, he would say that god had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies. alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. if asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to boxer; the two of them usually spent their sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking. the two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. at the last moment mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew mr. jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. she took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between boxer and clover; there she purred contentedly throughout major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying. all the animals were now present except moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. when major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began: ""comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that i had last night. but i will come to the dream later. i have something else to say first. i do not think, comrades, that i shall be with you for many months longer, and before i die, i feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as i have acquired. i have had a long life, i have had much time for thought as i lay alone in my stall, and i think i may say that i understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living. it is about this that i wish to speak to you. ""now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. we are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. no animal in england knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. no animal in england is free. the life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth. ""but is this simply part of the order of nature? is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? no, comrades, a thousand times no! the soil of england is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. this single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep—and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our"
orwell,"imagining. why then do we continue in this miserable condition? because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. there, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. it is summed up in a single word—man. man is the only real enemy we have. remove man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever. ""man is the only creature that consumes without producing. he does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. yet he is lord of all the animals. he sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. you cows that i see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year? and what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves? every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies. and you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? the rest have all gone to market to bring in money for jones and his men. and you, clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age? each was sold at a year old—you will never see one of them again. in return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall? ""and even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span. for myself i do not grumble, for i am one of the lucky ones. i am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. such is the natural life of a pig. but no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. you young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. to that horror we all must come—cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. you, boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. as for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond. ""is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? only get rid of man, and the produce of our labour would be our own. almost overnight we could become rich and free. what then must we do? why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! that is my message to you, comrades: rebellion! i do not know when that rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but i know, as surely as i see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done. fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! and above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious. ""and remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. no argument must lead you astray. never listen when they tell you that man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. it is all lies. man serves the interests of no creature except himself. and among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. all men are enemies. all animals are comrades."" at this moment there was a tremendous uproar. while major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him. the dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives. major raised his trotter for silence. ""comrades,"" he said, ""here is a point that must be settled. the wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits—are they our friends or our enemies? let us put it to the vote. i propose this question to the meeting: are rats comrades?"" the vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades. there were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides. major continued: ""i have little more to say. i merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards man and all his ways. whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. and remember also that in fighting against man, we must not come to resemble him. even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. no animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. all the habits of man are evil. and, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. no animal must ever kill any other animal. all animals are equal. ""and now, comrades, i will tell you about my dream of last night. i cannot describe"
orwell,"that dream to you. it was a dream of the earth as it will be when man has vanished. but it reminded me of something that i had long forgotten. many years ago, when i was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. i had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. and what is more, the words of the song also came back—words, i am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. i will sing you that song now, comrades. i am old and my voice is hoarse, but when i have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. it is called 'beasts of england.'"" old major cleared his throat and began to sing. as he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between ""clementine"" and ""la cucaracha."" the words ran beasts of england, beasts of ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken to my joyful tidings of the golden future time. soon or late the day is coming, tyrant man shall be o'erthrown, and the fruitful fields of england shall be trod by beasts alone. rings shall vanish from our noses, and the harness from our back, bit and spur shall rust forever, cruel whips no more shall crack. riches more than mind can picture, wheat and barley, oats and hay, clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels shall be ours upon that day. bright will shine the fields of england, purer shall its waters be, sweeter yet shall blow its breezes on the day that sets us free. for that day we all must labour, though we die before it break; cows and horses, geese and turkeys, all must toil for freedom's sake. beasts of england, beasts of ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken well and spread my tidings of the golden future time. the singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement. almost before major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves. even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. and then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into ""beasts of england"" in tremendous unison. the cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it. they were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted. unfortunately, the uproar awoke mr. jones, who sprang out of bed, feeling sure that there was a fox in the yard. he seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number shot into the darkness. the pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. everyone fled to his own sleeping place. the birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment. t hree nights later old major died peacefully in his sleep. his body was buried at the foot of the orchard. this was early in march. during the next three months there was much secret activity. major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life. they did not know when the rebellion predicted by major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. the work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. preeminent among the pigs were two young boars named snowball and napoleon, whom mr. jones was breeding up for sale. napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking berkshire boar, the only berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. snowball was a more vivacious pig than napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character. all the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. the best known among them was a small fat pig named squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. he was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive. the others said of squealer that he could turn black into white. these three had elaborated old major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of animalism. several nights a week, after mr. jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of animalism to the others. at the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to mr. jones, whom they referred to as ""master,"" or made elementary remarks such as ""mr. jones feeds us. if he were gone, we should starve to death."" others asked such questions as ""why should we care what happens after we are dead?"" or ""if this rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?"" and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this"
orwell,"was contrary to the spirit of animalism. the stupidest questions of all were asked by mollie, the white mare. the very first question she asked snowball was: ""will there still be sugar after the rebellion?"" ""no,"" said snowball firmly. ""we have no means of making sugar on this farm. besides, you do not need sugar. you will have all the oats and hay you want."" ""and shall i still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?"" asked mollie. ""comrade,"" said snowball, ""those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?"" mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced. the pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by moses, the tame raven. moses, who was mr. jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. he claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called sugarcandy mountain, to which all animals went when they died. it was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, moses said. in sugarcandy mountain it was sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. the animals hated moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in sugarcandy mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place. their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, boxer and clover. these two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments. they were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of ""beasts of england,"" with which the meetings always ended. now, as it turned out, the rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. in past years mr. jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. he had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. for whole days at a time he would lounge in his windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. his men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed. june came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. on midsummer's eve, which was a saturday, mr. jones went into willingdon and got so drunk at the red lion that he did not come back till midday on sunday the men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. when mr. jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the news of the world over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. at last they could stand it no longer. one of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horns and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. it was just then that mr. jones woke up. the next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. this was more than the hungry animals could bear. with one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. the situation was quite out of their control. they had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. after only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. a minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph. mrs. jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. meanwhile the animals had chased jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. and so, almost before they knew what was happening, the rebellion had been successfully carried through: jones was expelled, and the manor farm was theirs. for the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of jones's hated reign. the harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which mr. jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well. the reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nose-bags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. so were the whips. all the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days. ""ribbons,"" he said, ""should be considered as clothes, which"
orwell,"are the mark of a human being. all animals should go naked."" when boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest. in a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of mr. jones. napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. then they sang ""beasts of england"" from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before. but they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. a little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm. the animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. yes, it was theirs—everything that they could see was theirs! in the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement. they rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. it was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own. then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse. that was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside. after a moment, however, snowball and napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. they tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the brussels carpet, the lithograph of queen victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. they were just coming down the stairs when mollie was discovered to be missing. going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom. she had taken a piece of blue ribbon from mrs. jones's dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. the others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched. a unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. all were agreed that no animal must ever live there. the animals had their breakfast, and then snowball and napoleon called them together again. ""comrades,"" said snowball, ""it is half-past six and we have a long day before us. today we begin the hay harvest. but there is another matter that must be attended to first."" the pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to mr. jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap. napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. then snowball (for it was snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out manor farm from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted animal farm . this was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. after this they went back to the farm buildings, where snowball and napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn. they explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of animalism to seven commandments. these seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on animal farm must live for ever after. with some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) snowball climbed up and set to work, with squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot. the commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. they ran thus: the seven commandments . whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. . whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. . no animal shall wear clothes. . no animal shall sleep in a bed. . no animal shall drink alcohol. . no animal shall kill any other animal. . all animals are equal. it was very neatly written, and except that ""friend"" was written ""freind"" and one of the ""s's"" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way through. snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. all the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the commandments by heart. ""now, comrades,"" cried snowball, throwing down the paintbrush, ""to the hayfield! let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than jones and his men could do."" but at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing. they had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and"
orwell,"their udders were almost bursting. after a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task. soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable interest. ""what is going to happen to all that milk?"" said someone. ""jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash,"" said one of the hens. ""never mind the milk, comrades!"" cried napoleon, placing himself in front of the buckets. ""that will be attended to. the harvest is more important. comrade snowball will lead the way. i shall follow in a few minutes. forward, comrades! the hay is waiting."" so the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared. h ow they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! but their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped. sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. but the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. as for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than jones and his men had ever done. the pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. with their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership. boxer and clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking behind and calling out ""gee up, comrade!"" or ""whoa back, comrade!"" as the case might be. and every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the hay and gathering it. even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. in the end they finished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually taken jones and his men. moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. there was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. and not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful. all through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. the animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master. with the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. there was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. they met with many difficulties—for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine—but the pigs with their cleverness and boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through. boxer was the admiration of everybody. he had been a hard worker even in jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. from morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. he had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work began. his answer to every problem, every setback, was ""i will work harder!""—which he had adopted as his personal motto. but everyone worked according to his capacity. the hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains. nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared. nobody shirked—or almost nobody. mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. and the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. it was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. she would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. but she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. old benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the rebellion. he did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. about the rebellion and its results he would express no opinion. when asked whether he was not happier now that jones was gone, he would say only ""donkeys live a long time. none of you has ever seen a dead donkey,"" and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer. on sundays there was no work. breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail. first came the hoisting of the flag. snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of mrs. jones's and had"
orwell,"painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. this was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every sunday morning. the flag was green, snowball explained, to represent the green fields of england, while the hoof and horn signified the republic of the animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. after the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the meeting. here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. it was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions. the other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. snowball and napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. but it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it. even when it was resolved—a thing no one could object to in itself—to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. the meeting always ended with the singing of ""beasts of england, and the afternoon was given up to recreation. the pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves. here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse. snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called animal committees. he was indefatigable at this. he formed the egg production; committee for the hens, the clean tails league for the cows, the wild comrades' re-education committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits), the whiter wool movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing. on the whole, these projects were a failure. the attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately. they continued to behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it. the cat joined the re-education committee and was very active in it for some days. she was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. she was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance. the reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. by the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree. as for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. the dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except the seven commandments. muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty. so far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. boxer could not get beyond the letter d. he would trace out a, b, c, d, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding. on several occasions, indeed, he did learn e, f, g, h, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten a, b, c, and d. finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. she would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them. none of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter a. it was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the seven commandments by heart. after much thought snowball declared that the seven commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: ""four legs good, two legs bad."" this, he said, contained the essential principle of animalism. whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. the birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but snowball proved to them that this was not so. ""a bird's wing, comrades,"" he said, ""is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. it should therefore be regarded as a leg. the distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief."" the birds did not understand snowball's long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart. f our legs good, two legs bad, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the seven commandments and in bigger letters. when they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating ""four legs good, two legs bad! four legs good, two legs bad!"" and keep it up for hours on end, never growing tired of it. napoleon took no interest in snowball's committees. he said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up. it happened that jessie"
orwell,"and bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies. as soon as they were weaned, napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education. he took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence. the mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. it was mixed every day into the pigs' mash. the early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. the animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. at this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use. all the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even snowball and napoleon. squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others. ""comrades!"" he cried. ""you do not imagine, i hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? many of us actually dislike milk and apples. i dislike them myself. our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. milk and apples (this has been proved by science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. we pigs are brainworkers. the whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. day and night we are watching over your welfare. it is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples. do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? jones would come back! yes. jones would come back! surely, comrades,"" cried squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, ""surely there is no one among you who wants to see jones come back?"" now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it was that they did not want jones back. when it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say. the importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. so it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone. b y the late summer the news of what had happened on animal farm had spread across half the county. every day snowball and napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the rebellion, and teach them the tune of ""beasts of england."" most of this time mr. jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the red lion at willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. the other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. at heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn jones's misfortune to his own advantage. it was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined animal farm were on permanently bad terms. one of them, which was named foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. its owner, mr. pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. the other farm, which was called pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. its owner was a mr. frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. these two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests. nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on animal farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it. at first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. the whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. they put it about that the animals on the manor farm (they insisted on calling it the manor farm; they would not tolerate the name ""animal farm"") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. when time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, frederick and pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on animal farm. it was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. this was what came of rebelling against the laws of nature, frederick and pilkington said. however, these stories were never fully believed. rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside. bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side. above all, the tune and even the words of ""beasts of england"" were known everywhere. it had spread with astonishing speed. the human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. they could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish."
orwell,"any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. and yet the song was irrepressible. the blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. and when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom. early in october, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of animal farm in the wildest excitement. jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from foxwood and pinchfield, had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm. they were all carrying sticks, except jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands. obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm. this had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. snowball, who had studied an old book of julius caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. he gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post. as the human beings approached the farm buildings, snowball launched his first attack. all the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. however, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. snowball now launched his second line of attack. muriel, benjamin, and all the sheep, with snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while benjamin turned round and lashed at them with his small hoofs. but once again the men, with their sticks and their hob-nailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard. the men gave a shout of triumph. they saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. this was just what snowball had intended. as soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. snowball now gave the signal for the charge. he himself dashed straight for jones. jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. the pellets scored bloody streaks along snowball's back, and a sheep dropped dead. without halting for an instant, snowball flung his fifteen stone against jones's legs. jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. but the most terrifying spectacle of all was boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. his very first blow took a stable-lad from foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. at the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run. panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard. they were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. there was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. at a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road. and so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way. all the men were gone except one. back in the yard boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. the boy did not stir. ""he is dead,"" said boxer sorrowfully. ""i had no intention of doing that. i forgot that i was wearing iron shoes. who will believe that i did not do this on purpose?"" ""no sentimentality, comrade!"" cried snowball, from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. ""war is war. the only good human being is a dead one."" ""i have no wish to take life, not even human life,"" repeated boxer, and his eyes were full of tears. ""where is mollie?"" exclaimed somebody. mollie in fact was missing. for a moment there was great alarm; it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them. in the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger. she had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off. and when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off. the animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. an impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. the flag was run up and ""beasts of england"" was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. at the graveside snowball made a little"
orwell,"speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for animal farm if need be. the animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, ""animal hero, first class,"" which was conferred there and then on snowball and boxer. it consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on sundays and holidays. there was also ""animal hero, second class,"" which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep. there was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. in the end, it was named the battle of the cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung. mr. jones's gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse. it was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year—once on october the twelfth, the anniversary of the battle of the cowshed, and once on midsummer day, the anniversary of the rebellion. a s winter drew on , mollie became more and more troublesome. she was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent. on every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water. but there were also rumours of something more serious. one day as mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, clover took her aside. ""mollie,"" she said, ""i have something very serious to say to you. this morning i saw you looking over the hedge that divides animal farm from foxwood. one of mr. pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the hedge. and—i was a long way away, but i am almost certain i saw this—he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. what does that mean, mollie?"" ""he didn't! i wasn't! it isn't true!"" cried mollie, beginning to prance about and paw the ground. ""mollie! look me in the face. do you give me your word of honour that that man was not stroking your nose?"" ""it isn't true!"" repeated mollie, but she could not look clover in the face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field. a thought struck clover. without saying anything to the others, she went to mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours. three days later mollie disappeared. for some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of willingdon. she was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. a fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock. she appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said. none of the animals ever mentioned mollie again. in january there came bitterly hard weather. the earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields. many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season. it had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifesdy cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. this arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between snowball and napoleon. these two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. if one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots. each had his own following, and there were some violent debates. at the meetings snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times. he was especially successful with the sheep. of late the sheep had taken to bleating ""four legs good, two legs bad"" both in and out of season, and they often interrupted the meeting with this. it was noticed that they were especially liable to break into ""four legs good, two legs bad"" at crucial moments in snowball's speeches. snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the farmer and stockbreeder which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. he talked learnedly about field-drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that snowball's would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time. but of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill. in the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm. after surveying the ground, snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. this would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and"
orwell,"would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. the animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation. within a few weeks snowball's plans for the windmill were fully worked out. the mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to mr. jones— one thousand useful things to do about the house, every man his own bricklayer, and electricity for beginners. snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. he was closeted there for hours at a time. with his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. all of them came to look at snowball's drawings at least once a day. even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. only napoleon held aloof. he had declared himself against the windmill from the start. one day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. he walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word. the whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (how these were to be procured, snowball did not say.) but he maintained that it could all be done in a year. and thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death. the animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogans, ""vote for snowball and the three-day week"" and ""vote for napoleon and the full manger."" benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. he refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on—that is, badly. apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defense of the farm. it was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the battle of the cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate mr. jones. they had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. as usual, snowball and napoleon were in disagreement. according to napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. according to snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. the one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. the animals listened first to napoleon, then to snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment. at last the day came when snowball's plans were completed. at the meeting on the following sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. when the animals had assembled in the big barn, snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. then napoleon stood up to reply. he said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. at this snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment snowball's eloquence had carried them away. in glowing sentences he painted a picture of animal farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals' backs. his imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. by the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. but just at this moment napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at snowball, uttered a high-pitched"
orwell,"whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before. at this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. they dashed straight for snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. in a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. he was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. one of them all but closed his jaws on snowball's tail, but snowball whisked it free just in time. then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more. silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. in a moment the dogs came bounding back. at first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. they kept close to napoleon. it was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to mr. jones. napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where major had previously stood to deliver his speech. he announced that from now on the sunday-morning meetings would come to an end. they were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. in future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. these would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. the animals would still assemble on sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing ""beasts of england,"" and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates. in spite of the shock that snowball's expulsion had given them, the animals were dismayed by this announcement. several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments. even boxer was vaguely troubled. he set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once. but suddenly the dogs sitting round napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of ""four legs good, two legs bad!"" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion. afterwards squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement to the others. ""comrades,"" he said, ""i trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that comrade napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! on the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. no one believes more firmly than comrade napoleon that all animals are equal. he would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. but sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? suppose you had decided to follow snowball, with his moonshine of windmills—snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?"" ""he fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed,"" said somebody. ""bravery is not enough,"" said squealer. ""loyalty and obedience are more important. and as to the battle of the cowshed, i believe the time will come when we shall find that snowball's part in it was much exaggerated. discipline, comrades, iron discipline! that is the watchword for today. one false step, and our enemies would be upon us. surely, comrades, you do not want jones back?"" once again this argument was unanswerable. certainly the animals did not want jones back; if the holding of debates on sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop. boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: ""if comrade napoleon says it, it must be right."" and from then on he adopted the maxim, ""napoleon is always right,"" in addition to his private motto of ""i will work harder."" by this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun. the shed where snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. every sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. the skull of old major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. after the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past. napoleon, with squealer and another pig named minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the"
orwell,"other pigs sitting behind. the rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn. napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of ""beasts of england,"" all the animals dispersed. on the third sunday after snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all. he did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work; it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. the plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. a special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. the building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years. that evening squealer explained privately to the other animals that napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. on the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among napoleon's papers. the windmill was, in fact, napoleon's own creation. why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? here squealer looked very sly. that, he said, was comrade napoleon's cunning. he had seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. now that snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. this, said squealer, was something called tactics. he repeated a number of times, ""tactics, comrades, tactics!"" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. the animals were not certain what the word meant, but squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions. a ll that year the animals worked like slaves. but they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings. throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in august napoleon announced that there would be work on sunday afternoons as well. this work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half. even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. the harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough. it was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one. the windmill presented unexpected difficulties. there was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. but the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. there seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs. only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody—namely, to utilise the force of gravity. huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. the animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope—even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments—they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. the horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even muriel and benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. by late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs. but it was a slow, laborious process. frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. nothing could have been achieved without boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together. when the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. to see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration. clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but boxer would never listen to her. his two slogans, ""i will work harder"" and ""napoleon is always right,"" seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems. he had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour. and in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted. the animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the hardness of their work. if they had no more food than they had had in jones's day, at"
orwell,"least they did not have less. the advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it. and in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. and again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates. nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make themselves felt. there was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm. later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill. how these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine. one sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. from now onwards animal farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. the needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. he was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in willingdon. the hens, said napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill. once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money—had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant meeting after jones was expelled? all the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. the four young pigs who had protested when napoleon abolished the meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. then, as usual, the sheep broke into ""four legs good, two legs bad!"" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. finally napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. there would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. he intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. a mr. whymper, a solicitor living in willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between animal farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every monday morning to receive his instructions. napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of ""long live animal farm!"" and after the singing of ""beasts of england"" the animals were dismissed. afterwards squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest. he assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. it was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by snowball. a few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but squealer asked them shrewdly, ""are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? have you any record of such a resolution? is it written down anywhere?"" and since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken. every monday mr. whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. he was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that animal farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having. the animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. nevertheless, the sight of napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. the human beings did not hate animal farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. they would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. and yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs. one symptom of this was that they had begun to call animal farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the manor farm. they had also dropped their championship of jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county. except through whymper, there was as yet no contact between animal farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with mr. pilkington of foxwood or with mr. frederick of pinchfield—but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously. it was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had"
orwell,"been passed in the early days, and again squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. it was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. it was also more suited to the dignity of the leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of napoleon under the title of ""leader"") to live in a house than in a mere sty. nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. boxer passed it off as usual with ""napoleon is always right!"", but clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the seven commandments which were inscribed there. finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched muriel. ""muriel,"" she said, ""read me the fourth commandment. does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?"" with some difficulty muriel spelt it out. ""it says, 'no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,' "" she announced finally. curiously enough, clover had not remembered that the fourth commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so. and squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective. ""you have heard, then, comrades,"" he said, ""that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse? and why not? you did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? a bed merely means a place to sleep in. a pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. the rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. we have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. and very comfortable beds they are too! but not more comfortable than we need, i can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. you would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades? you would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? surely none of you wishes to see jones back?"" the animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. and when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the morning than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either. by the autumn the animals were tired but happy. they had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything. it was almost half built now. after the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon. in their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing. only old benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time. november came, with raging south-west winds. building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement. finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. the hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance. in the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish. they had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal's throat. a terrible sight had met their eyes. the windmill was in ruins. with one accord they dashed down to the spot. napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone. napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. his tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity. suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up. ""comrades,"" he said quietly, ""do you know who is responsible for this? do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill? snowball!"" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. ""snowball has done this thing! in sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year. comrades, here and now i pronounce the death sentence upon snowball. animal hero, second class,' and half a bushel of apples to any animal who brings him to justice. a full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!"" the animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even snowball could be"
orwell,"guilty of such an action. there was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out ways of catching snowball if he should ever come back. almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll. they could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be snowball's. he gave it as his opinion that snowball had probably come from the direction of foxwood farm. ""no more delays, comrades!"" cried napoleon when the footprints had been examined. ""there is work to be done. this very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. we will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. forward, comrades! long live the windmill! long live animal farm!"" i t was a bitter winter. the stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into february. the animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time. out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was snowball who had destroyed the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin. the animals knew that this was not the case. still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone. for a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. they were always cold, and usually hungry as well. only boxer and clover never lost heart. squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of ""i will work harder!"" in january food fell short. the corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it. then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. the potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. for days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. starvation seemed to stare them in the face. it was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about animal farm. once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of mr. whymper to spread a contrary impression. hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. in addition, napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. on some suitable pretext whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. he was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on animal farm. nevertheless, towards the end of january it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. in these days napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. when he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. frequently he did not even appear on sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually squealer. one sunday morning squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. napoleon had accepted, through whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. the price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier. when the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. they had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that it would really happen. they were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder. for the first time since the expulsion of jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. led by three young black minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart napoleon's wishes. their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. he ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. the dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out."
orwell,"for five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes. nine hens had died in the meantime. their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis. whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away. all this while no more had been seen of snowball. he was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either foxwood or pinchfield. napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before. it happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared. it was well seasoned, and whymper had advised napoleon to sell it; both mr. pilkington and mr. frederick were anxious to buy it. napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. it was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with frederick, snowball was declared to be in hiding at foxwood, while, when he inclined toward pilkington, snowball was said to be at pinchfield. suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! the animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. he stole the corn, he upset the milkpails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to snowball. if a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that snowball had thrown it down the well. curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. the cows declared unanimously that snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep. the rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with snowball. napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into snowball's activities. with his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance. at every few steps napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell. he snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cowshed, in the hen-houses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of snowball almost everywhere. he would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, and exclaim in a terrible voice, ""snowball! he has been here! i can smell him distinctly!"" and at the word ""snowball"" all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth. the animals were thoroughly frightened. it seemed to them as though snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. in the evening squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report. ""comrades!"" cried squealer, making little nervous skips, ""a most terrible thing has been discovered. snowball has sold himself to frederick of pinchfield farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us! snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. but there is worse than that. we had thought that snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. but we were wrong, comrades. do you know what the real reason was? snowball was in league with jones from the very start! he was jones's secret agent all the time. it has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. to my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. did we not see for ourselves how he attempted—fortunately without success—to get us defeated and destroyed at the battle of the cowshed?"" the animals were stupefied. this was a wickedness far outdoing snowball's destruction of the windmill. but it was some minutes before they could fully take it in. they all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen snowball charging ahead of them at the battle of the cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from jones's gun had wounded his back. at first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on jones's side. even boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. he lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts. ""i do not believe that,"" he said. ""snowball fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed. i saw him myself. did we not give him 'animal hero, first class,' immediately afterwards?"" ""that was our mistake, comrade. for we know now—it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found—that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom."" ""but he was wounded,"" said boxer. ""we all saw him running with blood."" ""that was part of the arrangement!"" cried squealer. ""jones's shot only grazed him. i could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read it. the plot was for snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. and he very nearly succeeded—i will even say, comrades, he"
orwell,"would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic leader, comrade napoleon. do you not remember how, just at the moment when jones and his men had got inside the yard, snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? and do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that comrade napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'death to humanity!' and sank his teeth in jones's leg? surely you remember that, comrades?"" exclaimed squealer, frisking from side to side. now when squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the animals that they did remember it. at any rate, they remembered that at the critical moment of the battle snowball had turned to flee. but boxer was still a little uneasy. ""i do not believe that snowball was a traitor at the beginning,"" he said finally. ""what he has done since is different. but i believe that at the battle of the cowshed he was a good comrade."" ""our leader, comrade napoleon,"" announced squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, ""has stated categorically—categorically, comrade—that snowball was jones's agent from the very beginning—yes, and from long before the rebellion was ever thought of."" ""ah, that is different!"" said boxer. ""if comrade napoleon says it, it must be right."" ""that is the true spirit, comrade!"" cried squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at boxer with his little twinkling eyes. he turned to go, then paused and added impressively: ""i warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. for we have reason to think that some of snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!"" four days later, in the late afternoon, napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard. when they were all gathered together, napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself ""animal hero, first class,"" and ""animal hero, second class""), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines. they all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen. napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-pitched whimper. immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to napoleon's feet. the pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. to the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves upon boxer. boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. the dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs. boxer looked at napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go. napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered boxer to let the dog go, whereat boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling. presently the tumult died down. the four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances. napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes. they were the same four pigs as had protested when napoleon abolished the sunday meetings. without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over animal farm to mr. frederick. they added that snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been jones's secret agent for years past. when they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess. the three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward and stated that snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey napoleon's orders. they, too, were slaughtered. then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in the night. then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool—urged to do this, so she said, by snowball—and two other sheep confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. they were all slain on the spot. and so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of jones. when it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body. they were shaken and miserable. they did not know which was more shocking—the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. in the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves. since jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal. not even a rat had been killed. they had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth—clover, muriel, benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens—everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before napoleon ordered the animals to assemble. for some time nobody spoke. only boxer remained on his feet."
orwell,"he fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. finally he said: ""i do not understand it. i would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. it must be due to some fault in ourselves. the solution, as i see it, is to work harder. from now onwards i shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings."" and he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night. the animals huddled about clover, not speaking. the knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. most of animal farm was within their view—the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. it was a clear spring evening. the grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. never had the farm—and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property—appeared to the animals so desirable a place. as clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. if she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. these scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old major first stirred them to rebellion. if she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of major's speech. instead—she did not know why—they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. there was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. she knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of napoleon. but still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. it was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of jones's gun. such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them. at last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing ""beasts of england."" the other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over—very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before. they had just finished singing it for the third time when squealer, attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say. he announced that, by a special decree of comrade napoleon, ""beasts of england"" had been abolished. from now onwards it was forbidden to sing it. the animals were taken aback. ""why?"" cried muriel. ""it's no longer needed, comrade,"" said squealer stiffly. ""'beasts of england' was the song of the rebellion. but the rebellion is now completed. the execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act. the enemy both external and internal has been defeated. in 'beasts of england' we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. but that society has now been established. clearly this song has no longer any purpose."" frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of ""four legs good, two legs bad,"" which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion. so ""beasts of england"" was heard no more. in its place minimus, the poet, had composed another song which began: animal farm, animal farm, never through me shalt thou come to harm! and this was sung every sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag. but somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to ""beasts of england."" a few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered—or thought they remembered—that the sixth commandment decreed ""no animal shall kill any other animal."" and though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this. clover asked benjamin to read her the sixth commandment, and when benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched muriel. muriel read the commandment for her. it ran: ""no animal shall kill any other animal without cause. "" somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals' memory. but they saw now that the commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with snowball. throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year. to rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by"
orwell,"the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. there were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in jones's day. on sunday mornings squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred percent, three hundred percent, or five hundred percent, as the case might be. the animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the rebellion. all the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food. all orders were now issued through squealer or one of the other pigs. napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight. when he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud ""cock-a-doodle-doo"" before napoleon spoke. even in the farmhouse, it was said, napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others. he took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the crown derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room. it was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries. napoleon was now never spoken of simply as ""napoleon."" he was always referred to in formal style as ""our leader, comrade napoleon,"" and the pigs liked to invent for him such titles as father of all animals, terror of mankind, protector of the sheepfold, ducklings' friend, and the like. in his speeches, squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of napoleon's wisdom, the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. it had become usual to give napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. you would often hear one hen remark to another, ""under the guidance of our leader, comrade napoleon, i have laid five eggs in six days""; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, ""thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!"" the general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled ""comrade napoleon,"" which was composed by minimus and which ran as follows: friend of fatherless! fountain of happiness! lord of the swill-bucket! oh, how my soul is on fire when igaze at thy calm and commanding eye, like the sun in the sky, comrade napoleon! thou art the giver of all that thy creatures love, full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon; every beast great or small sleeps at peace in his stall, thou watchest over all, comrade napoleon! had i a sucking-pig, ere he had grown as big even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin, he should have learned to be faithful and true to thee, yes, his first squeak should be "" comrade napoleon! "" napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the seven commandments. it was surmounted by a portrait of napoleon, in profile, executed by squealer in white paint. meanwhile, through the agency of whymper, napoleon was engaged in complicated negotiations with frederick and pilkington. the pile of timber was still unsold. of the two, frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. at the same time there were renewed rumours that frederick and his men were plotting to attack animal farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. snowball was known to be still skulking on pinchfield farm. in the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder napoleon. they were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for napoleon's safety were taken. four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned. at about the same time it was given out that napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to mr. pilkington; he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between animal farm and foxwood. the relations between napoleon and pilkington, though they were only conducted through whymper, were now almost friendly. the animals distrusted pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to frederick, whom they both feared and hated. as the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger. frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of animal farm they would ask no questions. moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from pinchfield about the cruelties that frederick practised upon his animals. he had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade ded to their spurs. the animals' blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured"
orwell,"to be allowed to go out in a body and attack pinchfield farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. but squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in comrade napoleon's strategy. nevertheless, feeling against frederick continued to run high. one sunday morning napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description. the pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of ""death to humanity"" in favour of ""death to frederick."" in the late summer yet another of snowball's machinations was laid bare. the wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. a gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. the animals now also learned that snowball had never—as many of them had believed hitherto—received the order of ""animal hero, first class."" this was merely a legend which had been spread some time after the battle of the cowshed by snowball himself. so far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing cowardice in the battle. once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault. in the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort—for the harvest had to be gathered at almost the same time—the windmill was finished. the machinery had still to be installed, and whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed. in the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day! tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time. moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before. nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time! and when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running—when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph. napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named napoleon mill. two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in the barn. they were struck dumb with surprise when napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to frederick. tomorrow frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it away. throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with pilkington, napoleon had really been in secret agreement with frederick. all relations with foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been sent to pilkington. the pigeons had been told to avoid pinchfield farm and to alter their slogan from ""death to frederick"" to ""death to pilkington."" at the same time napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on animal farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated. all these rumours had probably originated with snowball and his agents. it now appeared that snowball was not, after all, hiding on pinchfield farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he was living—in considerable luxury, so it was said—at foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of pilkington for years past. the pigs were in ecstasies over napoleon's cunning. by seeming to be friendly with pilkington he had forced frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds. but the superior quality of napoleon's mind, said squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even frederick. frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. but napoleon was too clever for him. he had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed. already frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the windmill. meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. when it was all gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to inspect frederick's bank-notes. smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations, napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen. the animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill. and boxer put out his nose to sniff at the banknotes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath. three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse. the next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from napoleon's apartments. the news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. the banknotes were forgeries! frederick had got the timber for nothing! napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon frederick. when captured, he said, frederick should be boiled alive. at the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was"
orwell,"to be expected. frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm. in addition, four pigeons were sent to foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with pilkington. the very next morning the attack came. the animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news that frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate. boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they had had in the battle of the cowshed. there were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. the animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of napoleon and boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. a number of them were already wounded. they took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knotholes. the whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. for the moment even napoleon seemed at a loss. he paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching. wistful glances were sent in the direction of foxwood. if pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be won. but at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from pilkington. on it was pencilled the words: ""serves you right."" meanwhile frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. the animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. they were going to knock the windmill down. ""impossible!"" cried napoleon. ""we have built the walls far too thick for that. they could not knock it down in a week. courage, comrades!"" but benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. the two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill. slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, benjamin nodded his long muzzle. ""i thought so,"" he said. ""do you not see what they are doing? in another moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole."" terrified, the animals waited. it was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings. after a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions. then there was a deafening roar. the pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. when they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. slowly the breeze drifted it away. the windmill had ceased to exist! at this sight the animals' courage returned to them. the fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile, contemptible act. a mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. this time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail. it was a savage, bitter battle. the men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. a cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. even napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. but the men did not go unscathed either. three of them had their heads broken by blows from boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by jessie and bluebell. and when the nine dogs of napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. they saw that they were in danger of being surrounded. frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life. the animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge. they had won, but they were weary and bleeding. slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. the sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. and for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! even the foundations were partially destroyed. and in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. this time the stones had vanished too. the force of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds of yards. it was as though the windmill had never been. as they approached the farm squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction. and the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun. ""what is that gun firing for?"" said boxer. ""to celebrate our victory!"" cried squealer. ""what victory?"" said boxer. his knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg. ""what victory, comrade? have we not driven the enemy off our soil—the sacred soil of animal farm?"" ""but they have destroyed the windmill. and we had"
orwell,"worked on it for two years!"" ""what matter? we will build another windmill. we will build six windmills if we feel like it. you do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. the enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. and now—thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon—we have won every inch of it back again!"" ""then we have won back what we had before,"" said boxer. ""that is our victory,"" said squealer. they limped into the yard. the pellets under the skin of boxer's leg smarted painfully. he saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task. but for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been. but when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again—seven times it was fired in all—and heard the speech that napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory. the animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral. boxer and clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. two whole days were given over to celebrations. there were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog. it was announced that the battle would be called the battle of the windmill, and that napoleon had created a new decoration, the order of the green banner, which he had conferred upon himself. in the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten. it was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. it had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied. that night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of ""beasts of england"" were mixed up. at about half-past nine napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of mr. jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again. but in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. not a pig appeared to be stirring. it was nearly nine o'clock when squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill. he called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart. comrade napoleon was dying! a cry of lamentation went up. straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. with tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should do if their leader were taken away from them. a rumour went round that snowball had after all contrived to introduce poison into napoleon's food. at eleven o'clock squealer came out to make another announcement. as his last act upon earth, comrade napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death. by the evening, however, napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following morning squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery. by the evening of that day napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed whymper to purchase in willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. a week later napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up. it was given out that the pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that napoleon intended to sow it with barley. about this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was able to understand. one night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. it was a moonlit night. at the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the seven commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint. the dogs immediately made a ring round squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. none of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing. but a few days later muriel, reading over the seven commandments to herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong. they had thought the fifth commandment was ""no animal shall drink alcohol,"" but there were two words that they had forgotten. actually the commandment read: ""no animal shall drink alcohol to excess. "" b oxer's split hoof was a long time in healing. they had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended. boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. in the evenings he would admit privately to clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and benjamin urged boxer to work less hard. ""a"
orwell,"horse's lungs do not last for ever,"" she said to him. but boxer would not listen. he had, he said, only one real ambition left—to see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement. at the beginning, when the laws of animal farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. as yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. for a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year. meanwhile life was hard. the winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter. once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs. a too rigid equality in rations, squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of animalism. in any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. for the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (squealer always spoke of it as a ""readjustment,"" never as a ""reduction""), but in comparison with the days of jones, the improvement was enormous. reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. the animals believed every word of it. truth to tell, jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories. they knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep. but doubtless it had been worse in the old days. they were glad to believe so. besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference, as squealer did not fail to point out. there were many more mouths to feed now. in the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. the young pigs were piebald, and as napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. it was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. for the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. they took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. about this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on sundays. the farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. there were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill. then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. a stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. rations, reduced in december, were reduced again in february, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil. but the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. one afternoon in late february a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been dis-used in jones's time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. the animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. but no warm mash appeared, and on the following sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. the field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley. and the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the crown derby soup tureen. but if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. there were more songs, more speeches, more processions. napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a spontaneous demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and"
orwell,"triumphs of animal farm. at the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. the dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched napoleon's black cockerel. boxer and clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, ""long live comrade napoleon!"" afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in napoleon's honour, and a speech by squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. the sheep were the greatest devotees of the spontaneous demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of ""four legs good, two legs bad!"" but by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. they found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit. so that, what with the songs, the processions, squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time. in april, animal farm was proclaimed a republic, and it became necessary to elect a president. there was only one candidate, napoleon, who was elected unanimously. on the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details about snowball's complicity with jones. it now appeared that snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the battle of the cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on jones's side. in fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words ""long live humanity!"" on his lips. the wounds on snowball's back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by napoleon's teeth. in the middle of the summer moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years. he was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about sugarcandy mountain. he would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. ""up there, comrades,"" he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak—""up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see—there it lies, sugarcandy mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!"" he even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. many of the animals believed him. their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? a thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards moses. they all declared contemptuously that his stories about sugarcandy mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day. after his hoof had healed up, boxer worked harder than ever. indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year. apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in march. sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but boxer never faltered. in nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength was not what it had been. it was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. the others said, ""boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on""; but the spring came and boxer grew no fatter. sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. at such times his lips were seen to form the words, ""i will work harder""; he had no voice left. once again clover and benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but boxer paid no attention. his twelfth birthday was approaching. he did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on pension. late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that something had happened to boxer. he had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill. and sure enough, the rumour was true. a few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news: ""boxer has fallen! he lying on his side and can't get up!"" about half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the windmill stood. there lay boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. his eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat. a thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth. clover dropped to her knees at his side. ""boxer!"" she cried, ""how are you?"" ""it is my lung,"" said boxer in a weak voice. ""it does not matter. i think you will be able to finish the windmill without"
orwell,"me. there is a pretty good store of stone accumulated. i had only another month to go in any case. to tell you the truth, i had been looking forward to my retirement. and perhaps, as benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me."" ""we must get help at once,"" said clover. ""run, somebody, and tell squealer what has happened."" all the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give squealer the news. only clover remained, and benjamin, who lay down at boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail. after about a quarter of an hour squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern. he said that comrade napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send boxer to be treated in the hospital at willingdon. the animals felt a little uneasy at this. except for mollie and snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. however, squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in willingdon could treat boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. and about half an hour later, when boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall, where clover and benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him. for the next two days boxer remained in his stall. the pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and clover administered it to boxer twice a day after meals. in the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while benjamin kept the flies off him. boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened. if he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. it would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. he intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet. however, benjamin and clover could only be with boxer after working hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. the animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. it was the first time that they had ever seen benjamin excited—indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. ""quick, quick!"" he shouted. ""come at once! they're taking boxer away!"" without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. and boxer's stall was empty. the animals crowded round the van. ""good-bye, boxer!"" they chorused, ""good-bye!"" ""fools! fools!"" shouted benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. ""fools! do you not see what is written on the side of that van?"" that gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. muriel began to spell out the words. but benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read: ""'alfred simmonds, horse slaughterer and glue boiler, willingdon. dealer in hides and bone-meal. kennels supplied.' do you not understand what that means? they are taking boxer to the knacker's!"" a cry of horror burst from all the animals. at this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot. all the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. clover forced her way to the front. the van began to gather speed. clover tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. ""boxer!"" she cried. ""boxer! boxer! boxer!"" and just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, boxer's face, with the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van. ""boxer!"" cried clover in a terrible voice. ""boxer! get out! get out quickly! they're taking you to your death!"" all the animals took up the cry of ""get out, boxer, get out!"" but the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. it was uncertain whether boxer had understood what clover had said. but a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. he was trying to kick his way out. the time had been when a few kicks from boxer's hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood. but alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. in desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. ""comrades, comrades!"" they shouted. ""don't take your own brother to his death!"" but the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace. boxer's face did not reappear at the window too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. boxer was never seen again. three days later it"
orwell,"was announced that he had died in the hospital at willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have. squealer came to announce the news to the others. he had, he said, been present during boxer's last hours. ""it was the most affecting sight i have ever seen!"" said squealer, lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear. ""i was at his bedside at the very last. and at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. 'forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'forward in the name of the rebellion. long live animal farm! long live comrade napoleon! napoleon is always right.' those were his very last words, comrades."" here squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. he fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded. it had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour had been circulated at the time of boxer's removal. some of the animals had noticed that the van which took boxer away was marked ""horse slaughterer,"" and had actually jumped to the conclusion that boxer was being sent to the knacker's. it was almost unbelievable, said squealer, that any animal could be so stupid. surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved leader, comrade napoleon, better than that? but the explanation was really very simple. the van had previously been the property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old name out. that was how the mistake had arisen. the animals were enormously relieved to hear this. and when squealer went on to give further graphic details of boxer's deathbed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive meditines for which napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy. napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in boxer's honour. it had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on boxer's grave. and in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in boxer's honour. napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of boxer's two favourite maxims, ""i will work harder"" and ""comrade napoleon is always right""—maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own. on the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. that night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. no one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky. y ears passed . the seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by. a time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the rebellion, except clover, benjamin, moses the raven, and a number of the pigs. muriel was dead; bluebell, jessie, and pincher were dead. jones too was dead—he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the county. snowball was forgotten. boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him. clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes. she was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired. the talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been dropped. napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone. squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes. only old benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever. there were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. many animals had been born to whom the rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival. the farm possessed three horses now besides clover. they were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very stupid. none of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter b. they accepted everything that they were told about the rebellion and the principles of animalism, especially from clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it. the farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from mr. pilkington. the windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it. whymper had bought himself a dogcart. the windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. it was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. the animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed. but the luxuries of which snowball had once taught the animals to dream,"
orwell,"the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about. napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of animalism. the truest happiness he said, lay in working hard and living frugally. somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer—except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs. perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. it was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. there was, as squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. for example, squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called ""files,"" ""reports,"" ""minutes,"" and ""memoranda."" these were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. this was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, squealer said. but still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good. as for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been. they were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies. sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the rebellion, when jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. they could not remember. there was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better. the animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now. only old benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse—hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life. and yet the animals never gave up hope. more, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of animal farm. they were still the only farm in the whole county—in all england!—owned and operated by animals. not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. and when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of jones, the writing of the seven commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. none of the old dreams had been abandoned. the republic of the animals which major had foretold, when the green fields of england should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be within the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. even the tune of ""beasts of england"" was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. it might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. if they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. no creature among them went upon two legs. no creature called any other creature ""master."" all animals were equal. one day in early summer squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings. the sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under squealer's supervision. in the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. it ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them. squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. he was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed. it was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. it was clover's voice. she neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. then they saw what clover had seen. it was a pig walking on his hind legs. yes, it was squealer. a little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard. and a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully. and finally there was a tremendous baying"
orwell,"of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him. he carried a whip in his trotter. there was a deadly silence. amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. it was as though the world had turned upside-down. then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything—in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened—they might have uttered some word of protest. but just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of— ""four legs good, two legs better! four legs good, two legs better! four legs good, two legs better! "" it went on for five minutes without stopping. and by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse. benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. he looked round. it was clover. her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the seven commandments were written. for a minute or two they stood gazing at the tarred wall with its white lettering. ""my sight is failing,"" she said finally. ""even when i was young i could not have read what was written there. but it appears to me that that wall looks different. are the seven commandments the same as they used to be, benjamin?"" for once benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. there was nothing there now except a single commandment. it ran: all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others after that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. it did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to john bull, tit-bits, and the daily mirror. it did not seem strange when napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth—no, not even when the pigs took mr. jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which mrs. jones had been used to wear on sundays. a week later, in the afternoon, a number of dogcarts drove up to the farm. a deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of inspection. they were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill. the animals were weeding the turnip field. they worked diligently, hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors. that evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse. and suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. what could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? with one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden. at the gate they paused, half frightened to go on, but clover led the way in. they tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window. there, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table. the pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs. the company had been enjoying a game of cards, but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. a large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. no one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window. mr. pilkington, of foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. in a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. but before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say. it was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said—and, he was sure, to all others present—to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. there had been a time—not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments—but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of animal farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. it had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neigh-bourhood. too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. they had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. but all such doubts were now dispelled. today he and his friends had visited animal farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. he believed that"
orwell,"he was right in saying that the lower animals on animal farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately. he would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between animal farm and its neighbours. between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. their struggles and their difficulties were one. was not the labour problem the same everywhere? here it became apparent that mr. pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. after much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: ""if you have your lower animals to contend with,"" he said, ""we have our lower classes!"" this bon mot set the table in a roar; and mr. pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on animal farm. and now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full. ""gentlemen,"" concluded mr. pilkington, ""gentlemen, i give you a toast: to the prosperity of animal farm!"" there was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against mr. pilkington's before emptying it. when the cheering had died down, napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say. like all of napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. he too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. for a long time there had been rumours—circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy—that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. they had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. nothing could be further from the truth! their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. this farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. the title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly. he did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence still further. hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as ""comrade."" this was to be suppressed. there had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden. this, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried. his visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. if so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed. it would be a plain green flag from now onwards. he had only one criticism, he said, to make of mr. pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech. mr. pilkington had referred throughout to ""animal farm."" he could not of course know—for he, napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it—that the name ""animal farm"" had been abolished. henceforward the farm was to be known as ""the manor farm""—which, he believed, was its correct and original name. ""gentlemen,"" concluded napoleon, ""i will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. fill your glasses to the brim. gentlemen, here is my toast: to the prosperity of the manor farm!"" there was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs. but as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. what was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. but what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away. but they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. an uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. they rushed back and looked through the window again. yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. there were shoutings, hangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. the source of the trouble appeared to be that napoleon and mr. pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously. twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. no question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. the creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which. one i i t was a bright cold day in april, and the clocks were striking thirteen. winston smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. at one end of it a colored poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to"
orwell,"the wall. it depicted simply an enormous face, more than a meter wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black mustache and ruggedly handsome features. winston made for the stairs. it was no use trying the lift. even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week. the flat was seven flights up, and winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. on each landing, opposite the lift shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. b ig b rother i s w atching y ou , the caption beneath it ran. inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron. the voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. the instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. he moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagerness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. his hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. the black-mustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. there was one on the house front immediately opposite. b ig b rother i s w atching y ou , the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into winston's own. down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word ingsoc. in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. it was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. the patrols did not matter, however. only the thought police mattered. behind winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfillment of the ninth three-year plan. the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. any sound that winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it; moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. how often, or on what system, the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. you had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. it was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. a kilometer away the ministry of truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. this, he thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was london, chief city of airstrip one, itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania. he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this. were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with balks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken houses? but it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible. the ministry of truth—minitrue, in newspeak * —was startlingly different from any other object in sight. it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, three hundred meters into the air. from where winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the party: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. the ministry of truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided: the ministry of truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts; the ministry of peace, which concerned itself with war; the ministry of love, which maintained law and order; and the ministry of plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. their names,"
orwell,"in newspeak: minitrue, minipax, miniluv, and miniplenty. the ministry of love was the really frightening one. there were no windows in it at all. winston had never been inside the ministry of love, nor within half a kilometer of it. it was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons. winston turned round abruptly. he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-colored bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. he took down from the shelf a bottle of colorless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin . it gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of chinese rice-spirit. winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine. instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. the stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. the next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out onto the floor. with the next he was more successful. he went back to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. from the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. for some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an unusual position. instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. by sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. he could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. it was a peculiarly beautiful book. its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. he could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (""dealing on the free market,"" it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. he had carried it guiltily home in his brief case. even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession. the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. this was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labor camp. winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. the pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink pencil. actually he was not used to writing by hand. apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose. he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. a tremor had gone through his bowels. to mark the paper was the decisive act. in small clumsy letters he wrote: april th, . he sat back. a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. to begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was . it must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in or ; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. for whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? for the future, for the unborn. his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against"
orwell,"the newspeak word doublethink. for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. how could you communicate with the future? it was of its nature impossible. either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless. for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. the telescreen had changed over to strident military music. it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. the actual writing would be easy. all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. at this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. he dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. the seconds were ticking by. he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin. suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: april th, . last night to the flicks. all warfilms. one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean. audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him. first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turnedpink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank, then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middleaged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms; little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood, then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never— winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. it was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today. it had happened that morning at the ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen. it was nearly eleven hundred, and in the records department, where winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the center of the hall, opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the two minutes hate. winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. he did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the fiction department. presumably—since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. she was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick dark hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. a narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the junior anti-sex league, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. he knew the reason. it was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. he disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. it was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. once when they passed in the corridor she had given him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him"
orwell,"and for a moment had filled him with black terror. the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police. that, it was true, was very unlikely. still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him. the other person was a man named o'brien, a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature. a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching. o'brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming—in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. it was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. winston had seen o'brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. he felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o'brien's urbane manner and his prizefighter's physique. much more it was because of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope—that o'brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect. something in his face suggested it irresistibly. and again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess; indeed, there was no way of doing so. at this moment o'brien glanced at his wristwatch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over. he took a chair in the same row as winston, a couple of places away. a small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them. the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind. the next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. it was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck. the hate had started. as usual, the face of emmanuel goldstein, the enemy of the people, had flashed onto the screen. there were hisses here and there among the audience. the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the party, almost on a level with big brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. the program of the two minutes hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure. he was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the party's purity. all subsequent crimes against the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters; perhaps even—so it was occasionally rumored—in some hiding place in oceania itself. winston's diaphragm was constricted. he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. it was a lean jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. it resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheeplike quality. goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. he was abusing big brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party, and even contained newspeak words: more newspeak words, indeed, than any party member would normally use in real life. and all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to goldstein's bleating voice. before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. the self-satisfied sheeplike face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne; besides, the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia, since when oceania was at war with"
orwell,"one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other. but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day, and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were—in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police. he was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state. the brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. there were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. it was a book without a title. people referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. but one knew of such things only through vague rumors. neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy. people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. the little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. even o'brien's heavy face was flushed. he was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. the dark-haired girl behind winston had begun crying out ""swine! swine! swine!"" and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dietionary and flung it at the screen. it struck goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. within thirty seconds any pretense was always unnecessary. a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. thus, at one moment winston's hatred was not turned against goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against big brother, the party, and the thought police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true. at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into adoration, and big brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of asia, and goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. it was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. he would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian. he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. he hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity. the hate rose to its climax. the voice of goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his submachine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. but in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother, black-haired, black mustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. nobody heard what big brother was saying. it was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. then the face of big brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen,"
orwell,"as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. the little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward oyer the back of the chair in front of her. with a tremulous murmur that sounded like ""my savior!"" she extended her arms toward the screen. then she buried her face in her hands. it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer. at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of ""b-b!...b-b!...b-b!"" over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first ""b"" and the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. winston's entrails seemed to grow cold. in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this subhuman chanting of ""b-b!...b-b!"" always filled him with horror. of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. to dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression in his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened—if, indeed, it did happen. momentarily he caught o'brien's eye. o'brien had stood up. he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen winston knew—yes, he knew! —that o'brien was thinking the same thing as himself. an unmistakable message had passed. it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. ""i am with you,"" o'brien seemed to be saying to him. ""i know precisely what you are feeling. i know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. but don't worry, i am on your side!"" and then the flash of intelligence was gone, and o'brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's. that was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. such incidents never had any sequel. all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the party. perhaps the rumors of vast underground conspiracies were true after all—perhaps the brotherhood really existed! it was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth. some days he believed in it, some days not. there was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hands which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. it was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at o'brien again. the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. it would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. for a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. but even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live. winston roused himself and sat up straighter. he let out a belch. the gin was rising from his stomach. his eyes refocused on the page. he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. and it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. his pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals— down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again, filling half a page. he could not help feeling a twinge of panic. it was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary; but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether. he did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. whether he wrote down with big brother, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference. whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. the thought police would get him just the same. he had committed—would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itself. thoughtcrime, they called it. thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. you might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you. it was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night. the sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. in the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. people simply disappeared, always during the night. your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. you were"
orwell,"abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word. for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother— he sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. the next moment he started violently. there was a knocking at the door. already! he sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. but no, the knocking was repeated. the worst thing of all would be to delay. his heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. he got up and moved heavily toward the door. ii a s he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. down with big brother was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done. but, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet. he drew in his breath and opened the door. instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. a colorless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside. ""oh, comrade,"" she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, ""i thought i heard you come in. do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? it's got blocked up and—"" it was mrs. parsons, the wife of a neighbor on the same floor. (""mrs."" was a word somewhat discountenanced by the party—you were supposed to call everyone ""comrade""—but with some women one used it instinctively.) she was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. winston followed her down the passage. these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation. victory mansions were old flats, built in or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window pane for two years. ""of course it's only because tom isn't home,"" said mrs. parsons vaguely. the parsons's flat was bigger than winston's, and dingy in a different way. everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. games impedimenta—hockey sticks, boxing gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out—lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise books. on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies, and a full-sized poster of big brother. there was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which—one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how—was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen. ""it's the children,"" said mrs. parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door. ""they haven't been out today. and of course—"" she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe. he hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing. mrs. parsons looked on helplessly. ""of course if tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,"" she said. ""he loves anything like that. he's ever so good with his hands, tom is."" parsons was winston's fellow employee at the ministry of truth. he was a fattish but active man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the party depended. at thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the youth league, and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age. at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. he would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the community center every evening for the past four years. an overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone. ""have you got a spanner?"" said winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint. ""a spanner,"" said mrs. parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. ""i don't know, i'm sure. perhaps the children—"" there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living room. mrs. parsons brought the spanner. winston let"
orwell,"out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. he cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room. ""up with your hands!"" yelled a savage voice. a handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, gray shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies. winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's demeanor, that it was not altogether a game. ""you're a traitor!"" yelled the boy. ""you're a thought-criminal! you're a eurasian spy! i'll shoot you, i'll vaporize you, i'll send you to the salt mines!"" suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting ""traitor!"" and ""thought-criminal!"", the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. it was somehow slightly frightening, like the gamboling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, winston thought. mrs. parsons's eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children, and back again. in the better light of the living room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face. ""they do get so noisy,"" she said. ""they're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. i'm too busy to take them and tom won't be back from work in time."" ""why can't we go and see the hanging?"" roared the boy in his huge voice. ""want to see the hanging! want to see the hanging!"" chanted the little girl, still capering round. some eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the park that evening, winston remembered. this happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. children always clamored to be taken to see it. he took his leave of mrs. parsons and made for the door. but he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. it was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. he spun round just in time to see mrs. parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult. ""goldstein!"" bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. but what most struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's grayish face. back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. the music from the telescreen had stopped. instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland and the faroe islands. with those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. nearly all children nowadays were horrible. what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party. on the contrary, they adored the party and everything connected with it. the songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of big brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them. all their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the state, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. it was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. and with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which the times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak—""child hero"" was the phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising remark and denounced his parents to the thought police. the sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. he picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. suddenly he began thinking of o'brien again. years ago—how long was it? seven years it must be—he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. and someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: ""we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."" it was said very quietly, almost casually—a statement, not a command. he had walked on without pausing. what was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. it was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. he could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen o'brien for the first time; nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as o'brien's. but at any rate the identification existed. it was o'brien who had spoken to him out of the dark. winston had never been able to feel sure—even after this morning's flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure—whether o'brien was a friend or an enemy. nor did it even seem to matter greatly. there was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship. ""we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,"" he had said. winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way"
orwell,"or another it would come true. the voice from the telescreen paused. a trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. the voice continued raspingly: ""attention! your attention, please! a newsflash has this moment arrived from the malabar front. our forces in south india have won a glorious victory. i am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. here is the newsflash—"" bad news coming, thought winston. and sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to twenty. winston belched again. the gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. the telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into ""oceania, 'tis for thee."" you were supposed to stand to attention. however, in his present position he was invisible. ""oceania, 'tis for thee"" gave way to lighter music. winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. the day was still cold and clear. somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present. down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word ingsoc fitfully appeared and vanished. ingsoc. the sacred principles of ingsoc. newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. he was alone. the past was dead, the future was unimaginable. what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure forever? like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. he took a twenty-five-cent piece out of his pocket. there, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother. even from the coin the eyes pursued you. on coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere. always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed—no escape. nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside your skull. the sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the ministry of truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. his heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. it was too strong, it could not be stormed. a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. for the future, for the past—for an age that might be imaginary. and in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapor. only the thought police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive? the telescreen struck fourteen. he must leave in ten minutes. he had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty. curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. he was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. but so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. he went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote: to the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone—to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: from the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of big brother, from the age of doublethink—greetings! he was already dead, he reflected. it seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. the consequences of every act are included in the act itself. he wrote: thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death. now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. two fingers of his right hand were inkstained. it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. some nosing zealot in the ministry (a woman, probably; someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the fiction department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen, what he had been writing—and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose. he put the diary away in the drawer. it was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. a hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. with the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was"
orwell,"bound to be shaken off if the book was moved. iii w inston was dreaming of his mother. he must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. she was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles. the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties. at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. he did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. both of them were looking up at him. they were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. they were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. there was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight forever. he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here. he knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things. he could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. it was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there were still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. his mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. such things, he saw, could not happen today. today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking. suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. the landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country. it was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair. somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees. the girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the field. with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him; indeed, he barely looked at it. what overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. winston woke up with the word ""shakespeare"" on his lips. the telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. it was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a member of the outer party received only three thousand clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pajamas was six hundred—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. the physical jerks would begin in three minutes. the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. his veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. ""thirty to forty group!"" yapped a piercing female voice. ""thirty to forty group! take your places, please. thirties to forties!"" winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny"
orwell,"but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym shoes, had already appeared. ""arms bending and stretching!"" she rapped out. ""take your time by me. one, two, three, four! one, two, three, four! come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! one, two, three four! one, two, three, four!..."" the pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winston's mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. as he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. it was extraordinarily difficult. beyond the late fifties everything faded. when there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. everything had been different then. even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. airstrip one, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called england or britain, though london, he felt fairly certain, had always been called london. winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester. he did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. his mother, in her slow dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. she was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station. there were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair; his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. he reeked of gin. it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. in his childish way winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. it also seemed to him that he knew what it was. someone whom the old man loved, a little granddaughter perhaps, had been killed. every few minutes the old man kept repeating: ""we didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em. i said so, ma, didn't i? that's what come of trusting 'em. i said so all along. we didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers."" but which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted winston could not now remember. since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself, some of which he remembered vividly. but to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. at this moment, for example, in (if it was ), oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia. in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. actually, as winston well knew, it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia. but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. officially the change of partners had never happened. oceania was at war with eurasia: therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia. the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible. the frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles)—the frightening thing was that it might all be true. if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened — that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death. the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia. he, winston smith, knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago. but where did that knowledge exist? only in his own consciousness, which in"
orwell,"any case must soon be annihilated. and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. ""who controls the past,"" ran the party slogan, ""controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."" and yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. it was quite simple. all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. ""reality control,"" they called it; in newspeak, ""doublethink."" ""stand easy!"" barked the instructress, a little more genially. winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. to know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. even to understand the word ""doublethink"" involved the use of doublethink. the instructress had called them to attention again. ""and now let's see which of us can touch our toes!"" she said enthusiastically. ""right over from the hips, please, comrades. one- two! one- two!..."" winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit. the half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. the past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother. he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. in the party histories, of course, big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days. his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motor cars or horse carriages with glass sides. there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence. he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before , but it was possible that in its oldspeak form—""english socialism,"" that is to say—it had been current earlier. everything melted into mist. sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. it was not true, for example, as was claimed in the party history books, that the party had invented airplanes. he remembered airplanes since his earliest childhood. but you could prove nothing. there was never any evidence. just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of a historical fact. and on that occasion— ""smith!"" screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. "" smith w! yes, you! bend lower, please! you can do better than that. you're not trying. lower, please! that's better, comrade. now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me."" a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winston's body. his face remained completely inscrutable. never show dismay! never show resentment! a single flicker of the eyes could give you away. he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and—one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency—bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes. "" there, comrades! that's how i want to see you doing it. watch me again. i'm thirty-nine and i've had four children. now look."" she bent over again. ""you see my knees aren't bent. you can all do it if you want to,"" she added as she straightened herself up. ""anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes. we don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. remember our boys on the malabar front! and the sailors in the floating fortresses! just think what they have to put up with. now try again. that's better, comrade, that's much better,"" she added encouragingly as winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years. iv w ith the deep , unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started, winston pulled the speakwrite toward him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk. in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. to the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. this last was for the disposal of wastepaper. similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building,"
orwell,"not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. when one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of wastepaper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building. winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated jargon—not actually newspeak, but consisting largely of newspeak words—which was used in the ministry for internal purposes. they ran: times .. bb speech malreported africa rectify times .. forecasts yp th quarter misprints verify current issue times .. miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify times .. reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside. it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. the other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures. winston dialed ""back numbers"" on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay. the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. for example, it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that big brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa. as it happened, the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone. it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. or again, the times of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of , which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth three-year plan. today's issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. as for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. as short a time ago as february, the ministry of plenty had issued a promise (a ""categorical pledge"" were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during . actually, as winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grams to twenty at the end of the present week. all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april. as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames. what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound tracks, cartoons, photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. all history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. in no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. the largest section of the records department, far larger than the one on which winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. a number of the times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. even the written instructions which winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed; always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy. but actually, he thought as he readjusted the ministry of plenty's figures, it was not even forgery."
orwell,"it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. for example, the ministry of plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at a hundred and forty-five million pairs. the actual output was given as sixty-two millions. winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. in any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than a hundred and forty-five millions. very likely no boots had been produced at all. likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot. and so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain. winston glanced across the hall. in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. he looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winston's direction. winston hardly knew tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs. in the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate. he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in, day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. there was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. and a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and meters, was engaged in producing garbled versions—definitive texts, they were called—of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies. and this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the records department. beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. there were the huge printing shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. there was the teleprograms section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. and somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence. and the records department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programs, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's spelling book to a newspeak dictionary. and the ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime, and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. there was even a whole sub-section— pornosec, it was called in newspeak—engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at. three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working; but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him. when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle, took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning. winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work. most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate pieces"
orwell,"of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say. winston was good at this kind of thing. on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles, which were written entirely in newspeak. he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. it ran: times .. reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. in oldspeak (or standard english) this might be rendered: the reporting of big brother's order for the day in the times of december rd is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to nonexistent persons. rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing. winston read through the offending article. big brother's order for the day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses. a certain comrade withers, a prominent member of the inner party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the order of conspicuous merit, second class. three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. that was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. the great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special showpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. more commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. in some cases they might not even be dead. perhaps thirty people personally known to winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another. winston stroked his nose gently with a paper clip. in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. he raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. it was perfectly possible. so tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person; on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said. and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth. winston did not know why withers had been disgraced. perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. or perhaps—what was likeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. the only real clue lay in the words ""refs unpersons,"" which indicated that withers was already dead. you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time forever. withers, however, was already an unperson. he did not exist: he had never existed. winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother's speech. it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject. he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of overproduction in the ninth three-year plan, might complicate the records too much. what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy. suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready-made as it were, the image of a certain comrade ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy. it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence. winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite toward him and began dictating in big brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them (""what lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? the lessons—which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc—that,"" etc., etc.), easy to imitate. at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a submachine gun, and a model helicopter. at six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he had joined the spies; at nine he had been a troop leader. at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior"
orwell,"anti-sex league. at nineteen he had designed a hand grenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one eurasian prisoners in one burst. at twenty-three he had perished in action. pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all—an end, said big brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. big brother added a few remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of comrade ogilvy's life. he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally. winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit; in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail. once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. there was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. comrade ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. comrade ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as charlemagne or julius caesar. v i n the low-ceilinged canteen, deep under ground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin. on the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip. ""just the man i was looking for,"" said a voice at winston's back. he turned round. it was his friend syme, who worked in the research department. perhaps ""friend"" was not exactly the right word. you did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades; but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others. syme was a philologist, a specialist in newspeak. indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary. he was a tiny creature, smaller than winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you. ""i wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades,"" he said. ""not one!"" said winston with a sort of guilty haste. ""i've tried all over the place. they don't exist any longer."" everyone kept asking you for razor blades. actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up. there had been a famine of them for months past. at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply. sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. you could only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the ""free"" market. ""i've been using the same blade for six weeks,"" he added untruthfully. the queue gave another jerk forward. as they halted he turned and faced syme again. each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the edge of the counter. ""did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?"" said syme. ""i was working,"" said winston indifferently. ""i shall see it on the flicks, i suppose."" ""a very inadequate substitute,"" said syme. his mocking eyes roved over winston's face. ""i know you,"" the eyes seemed to say, ""i see through you. i know very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged."" in an intellectual way, syme was venomously orthodox. he would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, the trials and confessions of thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love. talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes. ""it was a good hanging,"" said syme reminiscently. ""i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. i like to see them kicking. and above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue—a quite bright blue. that's the detail that appeals to me."" ""nex', please!"" yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle. winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. onto each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—a metal pannikin of pinkish-gray stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless victory coffee, and one saccharine tablet. ""there's a table over there, under that telescreen,"" said syme. ""let's pick up a gin on the way."" the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. they threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays onto the metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit."
orwell,"winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. he began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. from the table at winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room. ""how is the dictionary getting on?"" said winston, raising his voice to overcome the noise. ""slowly,"" said syme. ""i'm on the adjectives. it's fascinating."" he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak. he pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting. ""the eleventh edition is the definitive edition,"" he said. ""we're getting the language into its final shape—the shape it's going to have when nobody speaks anything else. when we've finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. you think, i dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. but not a bit of it! we're destroying words—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. we're cutting the language down to the bone. the eleventh edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year ."" he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant's passion. his thin dark face had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy. ""it's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. it isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. after all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? a word contains its opposite in itself. take 'good,' for instance. if you have a word like 'good,' what need is there for a word like 'bad'? 'ungood' will do just as well—better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not. or again, if you want a stronger version of 'good,' what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like 'excellent' and 'splendid' and all the rest of them? 'plusgood' covers the meaning, or 'doubleplusgood' if you want something stronger still. of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of newspeak there'll be nothing else. in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality, only one word. don't you see the beauty of that, winston? it was b.b.'s idea originally, of course,"" he added as an afterthought. a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston's face at the mention of big brother. nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm. ""you haven't a real appreciation of newspeak, winston,"" he said almost sadly. ""even when you write it you're still thinking in oldspeak. i've read some of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally. they're good enough, but they're translations. in your heart you'd prefer to stick to oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. you don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?"" winston did know that, of course. he smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. syme bit off another fragment of the dark-colored bread, chewed it briefly, and went on: ""don't you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. already, in the eleventh edition, we're not far from that point. but the process will still be continuing long after you and i are dead. every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. even now, of course, there's no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. it's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. but in the end there won't be any need even for that. the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is newspeak,"" he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. ""has it ever occurred to you, winston, that by the year , at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?"" ""except—"" began winston doubtfully, and then stopped. it had been on the tip of his tongue to say ""except the proles,"" but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. syme, however, had divined what he was about to say. ""the proles are not human beings,"" he said carelessly. ""by —earlier, probably—all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared. the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. chaucer, shakespeare, milton, byron—they'll exist only in newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. even the literature of the party will change. even the slogans will change. how could you have a slogan like 'freedom is slavery' when the concept of freedom has been abolished? the whole climate of thought"
orwell,"will be different. in fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think. orthodoxy is unconsciousness."" one of these days, thought winston with sudden deep conviction, syme will be vaporized. he is too intelligent. he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. the party does not like such people. one day he will disappear. it is written in his face. winston had finished his bread and cheese. he turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. at the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. a young woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said. from time to time winston caught some such remark as ""i think you're so right, i do so agree with you,"" uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. but the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department. he was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. his head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes. what was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth, it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. just once winston caught a phrase—""complete and final elimination of gold-steinism""—jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. for the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. and yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army, he might be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabar front—it made no difference. whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure ingsoc. as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. it was not the man's brain that was speaking; it was his larynx. the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck. syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. the voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din. ""there is a word in newspeak,"" said syme. ""i don't know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. it is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. applied to an opponent, it is abuse; applied to someone you agree with, it is praise."" unquestionably syme will be vaporized, winston thought again. he thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. there was something subtly wrong with syme. there was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. you could not say that he was unorthodox. he believed in the principles of ingsoc, he venerated big brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary party member did not approach. yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. he said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the chestnut tree café, haunt of painters and musicians. there was no law, not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the chestnut tree café, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. the old, discredited leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged. goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. syme's fate was not difficult to foresee. and yet it was a fact that if syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, winston's, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the thought police. so would anybody else, for that matter, but syme more than most. zeal was not enough. orthodoxy was unconsciousness. syme looked up. ""here comes parsons,"" he said. something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, ""that bloody fool."" parsons, winston's fellow tenant at victory mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. at thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, gray shirt, and red neckerchief of the spies. in visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. he greeted them both with a cheery ""hullo, hullo!"" and sat down at the table, giving off an"
orwell,"intense smell of sweat. beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. his powers of sweating were extraordinary. at the community center you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle. syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying it with an ink pencil between his fingers. ""look at him working away in the lunch hour,"" said parsons, nudging winston. ""keenness, eh? what's that you've got there, old boy? something a bit too brainy for me, i expect. smith, old boy, i'll tell you why i'm chasing you. it's that sub you forgot to give me."" ""which sub is that?"" said winston, automatically feeling for money. about a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them. ""for hate week. you know—the house-by-house fund. i'm treasurer for our block. we're making an all-out effort—going to put on a tremendous show. i tell you, it won't be my fault if old victory mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. two dollars you promised me."" winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which parsons entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate. ""by the way, old boy,"" he said, ""i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. i gave him a good dressing down for it. in fact i told him i'd take the catapult away if he does it again."" ""i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,"" said winston. ""ah, well—what i mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it? mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness! all they think about is the spies, and the war, of course. d'you know what that little girl of mine did last saturday, when her troop was on a hike out berkhampstead way? she got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. they kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when they got into amersham, handed him over to the patrols."" ""what did they do that for?"" said winston, somewhat taken aback. parsons went on triumphantly: ""my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. but here's the point, old boy. what do you think put her onto him in the first place? she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes—said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. so the chances were he was a foreigner. pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?"" ""what happened to the man?"" said winston. ""ah, that i couldn't say, of course. but i wouldn't be altogether surprised if—"" parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion. ""good,"" said syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper. ""of course we can't afford to take chances,"" agreed winston dutifully. ""what i mean to say, there is a war on,"" said parsons. as though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads. however, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty. ""comrades!"" cried an eager youthful voice. ""attention, comrades! we have glorious news for you. we have won the battle for production! returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than twenty per cent over the past year. all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. here are some of the completed figures. foodstuffs—"" the phrase ""our new, happy life"" recurred several times. it had been a favorite of late with the ministry of plenty. parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. he could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. he had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. with the tobacco ration at a hundred grams a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe up to the top. winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grams a week. and only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grams a week. was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grams. syme, too—in some more complex way, involving doublethink—syme swallowed it. was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory? the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. as compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking pots, more fuel, more ships,"
orwell,"more helicopters, more books, more babies—more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. as syme had done earlier, winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-colored gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. he meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. had it always been like this? had food always tasted like this? he looked round the canteen. a low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. in any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-colored, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. and though, of course, it grew worse as one's body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one's socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different? he looked round the canteen again. nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. on the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beedelike man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. how easy it was, thought winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in airstrip one were small, dark, and ill-favored. it was curious how that beedelike type proliferated in the ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. it was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party. the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth. ""the ministry of plenty's certainly done a good job this year,"" he said with a knowing shake of his head. ""by the way, smith old boy, i suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?"" ""not one,"" said winston. ""i've been using the same blade for six weeks myself."" ""ah, well—just thought i'd ask you, old boy."" ""sorry,"" said winston. the quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs. parsons, with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs. parsons would be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. o'brien would be vaporized. parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. the little beedelike men who scuttled so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries—they, too, would never be vaporized. and the girl with dark hair, the girl from the fiction department—she would never be vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish, though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say. at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. it was the girl with dark hair. she was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity. the instant that she caught his eye she looked away again. the sweat started out on winston's backbone. a horrible pang of terror went through him. it was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. why was she watching him? why did she keep following him about? unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. but yesterday, at any rate, during the two minutes hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough. his earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the thought police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. he did not know how long she had been looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control. it was terribly dangerous to"
orwell,"let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. the smallest thing could give you away. a nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. in any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. there was even a word for it in newspeak: facecrime, it was called. the girl had turned her back on him again. perhaps after all she was not really following him about; perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. his cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. he would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it. quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. parsons had begun talking again. ""did i ever tell you, old boy,"" he said, chuckling round the stem of his pipe, ""about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of b.b.? sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. burned her quite badly, i believe. little beggars, eh? but keen as mustard! that's a first-rate training they give them in the spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. what d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with? ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! my little girl brought one home the other night—tried it out on our sitting room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole. of course it's only a toy, mind you. still, gives 'em the right idea, eh?"" at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. it was the signal to return to work. all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of winston's cigarette. vi w inston was writing in his diary: it was three years ago. it was on a dark evening, in a narrow side street near one of the big railway stations. she was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. she had a young face, painted very thick. it was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. party women never paint their faces. there was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. she said two dollars. i — for the moment it was too difficult to go on. he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring. he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him. your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back: a quite ordinary-looking man, a party member, aged thirty-five or forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief case. they were a few meters apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. it happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. he remembered thinking at the time: that poor devil is done for. and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. there was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see. he drew in his breath and went on writing: i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen. there was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. she — his teeth were set on edge. he would have liked to spit. simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine, his wife. winston was married—had been married, at any rate; probably he still was married, for so far as he knew his wife was not dead. he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odor of the basement kitchen, an odor compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. only the proles used scent. in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication. when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts. consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. it was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labor camp: not more, if you had committed no other offense. and it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. the poorer quarters swarmed with"
orwell,"women who were ready to sell themselves. some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless, and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members. but—though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening. the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though the principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another. the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party. sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. this again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards. there were even organizations such as the junior anti-sex league, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination ( artsem, it was called in newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. this, winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party. the party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. he did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. and so far as the women were concerned, the party's efforts were largely successful. he thought again of katharine. it must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted. it was curious how seldom he thought of her. for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. they had only been together for about fifteen months. the party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children. katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. she had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. very early in their married life he had decided—though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people—that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none, that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her. ""the human sound track"" he nicknamed her in his own mind. yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing—sex. as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression. she would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting. it was extraordinarily embarrassing and, after a while, horrible. but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this. they must, she said, produce a child if they could. so the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible. she used even to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. she had two names for it. one was ""making a baby,"" and the other was ""our duty to the party"" (yes, she had actually used that phrase). quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. but luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted. winston sighed inaudibly. he picked up his pen again and wrote: she threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt. i — he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharine's white body, frozen forever by the hypnotic power of the party. why did it always have to be like this? why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. the women of the party were all alike. chastity was as deeply ingrained in them as party loyalty. by careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. his"
orwell,"reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. they were all impregnable, as the party intended that they should be. and what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. the sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. desire was thoughtcrime. even to have awakened katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife. but the rest of the story had got to be written down. he wrote: i turned up the lamp. when i saw her in the light — after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright. for the first time he could see the woman properly. he had taken a step toward her and then halted, full of lust and terror. he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out; for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do—! it had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask. there were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. she had no teeth at all. he wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting: when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. but i went ahead and did it just the same. he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. he had written it down at last, but it made no difference. the therapy had not worked. the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever. vii if there is hope [wrote winston] it lies in the proles. if there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five per cent of the population of oceania, could the force to destroy the party ever be generated. the party could not be overthrown from within. its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. even if the legendary brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflecion of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word. but the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning. surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? and yet—! he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices—women's voices—had burst from a side street a little way ahead. it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud ""oh-o-o-o-oh!"" that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell. his heart had leapt. it's started! he had thought. a riot! the proles are breaking loose at last! when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. they were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking pots of any kind were always difficult to get. now the supply had unexpectedly given out. the successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamored round the stall, accusing the stallkeeper of favoritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. there was a fresh outburst of yells. two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another's hands. for a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. winston watched them disgustedly. and yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered? he wrote: until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious. that, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks. the party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. but simultaneously, true to the principles of doublethink, the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. in reality very little was known about the proles. it was not necessary to know much. so long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance."
orwell,"left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. they were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. to keep them in control was not difficult. a few agents of the thought police moved always among them, spreading false rumors and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party. it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. and even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. the larger evils invariably escaped their notice. the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes. even the civil police interfered with them very little. there was a vast amount of criminality in london, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them. promiscuity went unpunished; divorce was permitted. for that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. they were beneath suspicion. as the party slogan put it: ""proles and animals are free."" winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. it had begun itching again. the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like. he took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs. parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary: in the old days [it ran], before the glorious revolution, london was not the beautiful city that we know today. it was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under. children no older than you are had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters, who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. these rich men were called capitalists. they were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page. you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. this was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it. the capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. they owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. if anyone disobeyed them they could throw him into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death. when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as ""sir."" the chief of all the capitalists was called the king, and — but he knew the rest of the catalogue. there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine-tails, the lord mayor's banquet, and the practice of kissing the pope's toe. there was also something called the jus primae noctis, which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children. it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories. how could you tell how much of it was lies? it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution. the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve. great areas of it, even for a party member, were neutral and nonpolitical, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. the ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually"
orwell,"working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face. the reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. he seemed to see a vision of london, vast and ruinous, city of a million dust bins, and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs. parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe. he reached down and scratched his ankle again. day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. the party claimed, for example, that today forty per cent of adult proles were literate; before the revolution, it was said, the number had only been fifteen per cent. the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only a hundred and sixty per thousand, whereas before the revolution it had been three hundred—and so it went on. it was like a single equation with two unknowns. it might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy. for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat. everything faded into mist. the past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. just once in his life he had possessed— after the event: that was what counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification. he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds. in , it must have been—at any rate, it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted. but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier. the story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all. by none of them was left, except big brother himself. all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries. goldstein had fled and was hiding, no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. among the last survivors were three men named jones, aaronson, and rutherford. it must have been in that these three had been arrested. as often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted party members, intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. after confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. all three had written long, abject articles in the times, analyzing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends. some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree café. he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. they were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic early days of the party. the glamor of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. he had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother. but also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end. they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave. there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. it was not wise even to be seen in the neighborhood of such people. they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavored with cloves which was the speciality of the café. of the three, it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston. rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution. even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the times. they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats—an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past. he was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy gray hair, his face pouched and seamed, with protuberant lips. at one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging sloping bulging, falling away in every direction. he seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time. the place was almost empty. a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. the three"
orwell,"men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking. uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. there was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out, but no game started. and then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens. the tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. there came into it—but it was something hard to describe. it was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note; in his mind winston called it a yellow note. and then a voice from the telescreen was singing: "" under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me: there lie they, and here lie we under the spreading chestnut tree. "" the three men never stirred. but when winston glanced again at rutherford's ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. and for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses. a little later all three were rearrested. it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their re-lease. at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. they were executed, and their fate was recorded in the party histories, a warning to posterity. about five years after this, in , winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance. it was a half-page torn out of the times of about ten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included the date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york. prominent in the middle of the group were jones, aaronson, and rutherford. there was no mistaking them; in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom. the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil. they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia, and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. the date had stuck in winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. there was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies. of course, this was not in itself a discovery. even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. but this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. it was enough to blow the party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known. he had gone straight on working. as soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen. he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair, so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. to keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort; but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him. then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers. within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes. that was ten—eleven years ago. today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. was the party's hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed? but today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. already, at the time when he made his discovery, oceania was no longer at war with eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. since then there had been other changes—two, three, he could not remember how many. very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. the past not only changed, but changed continuously. what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. he took up his pen again and wrote: i understand how: i do not understand why. he wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable. he might be alone in holding that belief, and"
orwell,"if alone, then a lunatic. but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was that he might also be wrong. he picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece. the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you—something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. in the end the party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. the heresy of heresies was common sense. and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. for, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? or that the force of gravity works? or that the past is unchangeable? if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then? but no! his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. the face of o'brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind. he knew, with more certainty than before, that o'brien was on his side. he was writing the diary for o'brien— to o'brien; it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its color from that fact. the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. it was their final, most essential command. his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. and yet he was in the right! they were wrong and he was right. the obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. truisms are true, hold onto that! the solid world exists, its laws do not change. stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the earth's center. with the feeling that he was speaking to o'brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. if that is granted, all else follows. viii f rom somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not victory coffee—came floating out into the street. winston paused involuntarily. for perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood. then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound. he had walked several kilometers over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community center: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the center were carefully checked. in principle a party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. it was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreations; to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. there was a word for it in newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him. the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the center, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. on impulse he had turned away from the bus stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself along unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going. ""if there is hope,"" he had written in the diary, ""it lies in the proles."" the words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. he was somewhere in the vague, brown-colored slums to the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station. he was walking up a cobbled street of little two-story houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of rat holes. there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles. in and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alleyways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. most of the people paid no attention to winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached. ""'yes,' i says to 'er, 'that's all very well,' i says. 'but if you'd of been in my place you'd of done the same as what i done. it's easy to criticize,' i says, 'but you ain't got the"
orwell,"same problems as what i got.'"" ""ah,"" said the other, ""that's jest it. that's jest where it is."" the strident voices stopped abruptly. the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. but it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this. indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. ""may i see your papers, comrade? what are you doing here? what time did you leave work? is this your usual way home?""—and so on and so forth. not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route, but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it. suddenly the whole street was in commotion. there were yells of warning from all sides. people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. a young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement. at the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran toward winston, pointing excitedly to the sky. ""steamer!"" he yelled. ""look out, guv'nor! bang over'ead! lay down quick!"" ""steamer"" was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. winston promptly flung himself on his face. the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly traveled faster than sound. winston clasped his forearms about his head. there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered onto his back. when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window. he walked on. the bomb had demolished a group of houses two hundred meters up the street. a black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming round the ruins. there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast. he kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side street to the right. within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. it was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking shops which the proles frequented (""pubs,"" they called them) were choked with customers. from their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. in an angle formed by a projecting house front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder. even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows. ""can't you bleeding well listen to what i say? i tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen months!"" ""yes, it 'as, then!"" ""no, it 'as not! back 'ome i got the 'ole lot of 'em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper. i takes 'em down reg'lar as the clock. an' i tell you, no number ending in seven—"" ""yes, a seven 'as won! i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. four oh seven, it ended in. it were in february—second week in february."" ""february your grandmother! i got it all down in black and white. an' i tell you, no number—"" ""oh, pack it in!"" said the third man. they were talking about the lottery. winston looked back when he had gone thirty meters. they were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. the lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. it was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. where the lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. winston had nothing to do with the running of the lottery, which was managed by the ministry of plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons. in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange. but if there was hope, it lay in the proles. you had to cling onto that. when you put"
orwell,"it in words it sounded reasonable; it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. the street into which he had turned ran downhill. he had a feeling that he had been in this neighborhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. at this moment winston remembered where he was. the alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. and in a small stationer's shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink. he paused for a moment at the top of the steps. on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. a very old man, bent but active, with white mustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the revolution happened. he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution. the older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender. if there was anyone still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. he would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him. he would say to him: ""tell me about your life when you were a boy. what was it like in those days? were things better than they are now, or were they worse?"" hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the steps and crossed die narrow street. it was madness, of course. as usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe him. he pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. as he entered, the din of voices dropped to about half its volume. behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds. the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. a knot of others, standing round with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene. ""i arst you civil enough, didn't i?"" said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. ""you telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer?"" ""and what in hell's name is a pint?"" said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter. ""'ark at 'im! calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is! why, a pint's the 'alf of a quart, and there's four quarts to the gallon. 'ave to teach you the a, b, c next."" ""never heard of 'em,"" said the barman shortly. ""liter and half-liter—that's all we serve. there's the glasses on the shelf in front of you."" ""i likes a pint,"" persisted the old man. ""you could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough. we didn't 'ave these bleeding liters when i was a young man."" ""when you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,"" said the barman, with a glance at the other customers. there was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by winston's entry seemed to disappear. the old man's white-stubbled face had flushed pink. he turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into winston. winston caught him gently by the arm. ""may i offer you a drink?"" he said. ""you're a gent,"" said the other, straightening his shoulders again. he appeared not to have noticed winston's blue overalls. ""pint!"" he added aggressively to the barman. ""pint of wallop."" the barman swished two half-liters of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. the proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. the game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. winston's presence was forgotten for a moment. there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard. it was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in. ""'e could 'a drawed me off a pint,"" grumbled the old man as he settled down behind his glass. ""a 'alf liter ain't"
orwell,"enough. it don't satisfy. and a 'ole liter's too much. it starts my bladder running. let alone the price."" ""you must have seen great changes since you were a young man,"" said winston tentatively. the old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the gents, as though it were in the barroom that he expected the changes to have occurred. ""the beer was better,"" he said finally. ""and cheaper! when i was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint. that was before the war, of course."" ""which war was that?"" said winston. ""it's all wars,"" said the old man vaguely. he took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again. ""'ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth!"" in his lean throat the sharp-pointed adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-liters. the old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full liter. ""you are very much older than i am,"" said winston. ""you must have been a grown man before i was born. you can remember what it was like in the old days, before the revolution. people of my age don't really know anything about those times. we can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be true. i should like your opinion on that. the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now. there was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty—worse than anything we can imagine. here in london, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. half of them hadn't even boots on their feet. they worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. and at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were called—who were rich and powerful. they owned everything that there was to own. they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats—"" the old man brightened suddenly. ""top 'ats!"" he said. ""funny you should mention 'em. the same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday, i donno why. i was jest thinking, i ain't seen a top 'at in years. gorn right out, they 'ave. the last time i wore one was at my sister-in-law's funeral. and that was—well, i couldn't give you the date, but it must'a been fifty years ago. of course it was only 'ired for the occasion, you understand."" ""it isn't very important about the top hats,"" said winston pa-tiently. ""the point is, these capitalists—they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were the lords of the earth. everything existed for their benefit. you—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves. they could do what they liked with you. they could ship you off to canada like cattle. they could sleep with your daughters if they chose. they could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o'-nine-tails. you had to take your cap off when you passed them. every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who—"" the old man brightened again. ""lackeys!"" he said. ""now there's a word i ain't 'eard since ever so long. lackeys! that reg'lar takes me back, that does. i recollect—oh, donkey's years ago—i used to sometimes go to 'yde park of a sunday afternoon to 'ear the blokes making speeches. salvation army, roman catholics, jews, indians—all sorts there was. and there was one bloke—well, i couldn't give you 'is name, but a real powerful speaker 'e was. 'e didn't 'alf give it 'em! 'lackeys!' 'e says, 'lackeys of the bourgeoisie! flunkies of the ruling class!' parasites—that was another of them. and 'yenas—'e definitely called 'em 'yenas. of course 'e was referring to the labour party, you understand."" winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross purposes. ""what i really wanted to know was this,"" he said. ""do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days? are you treated more like a human being? in the old days, the rich people, the people at the top—"" ""the 'ouse of lords,"" put in the old man reminiscently. ""the house of lords, if you like. what i am asking is, were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you were poor? is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them 'sir' and take off your cap when you passed them?"" the old man appeared to think deeply. he drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering. ""yes,"" he said. ""they liked you to touch your cap to 'em. it showed respect, like. i didn't agree with it, myself, but i done it often enough. had to, as you might say."" ""and was it usual—i'm only quoting what i've read in history books—was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter?"" ""one of 'em pushed me once,"" said the old man. ""i recollect it as if it was yesterday. it was boat race night—terrible rowdy they used to get on boat race night—and i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue. quite a gent, 'e was—dress shirt, top 'at, black overcoat. 'e was kind of zigzagging across the pavement, and i bumps into 'im accidental-like. 'e says, 'why can't you look where you're going?' 'e says. i says, 'ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement?' 'e says, 'i'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me.' i says, 'you're drunk. i'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute,' i says. 'an"
orwell,"if you'll believe me, 'e puts 'is 'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus. well, i was young in them days, and i was going to 'ave fetched 'im one, only—"" a sense of helplessness took hold of winston. the old man's memory was nothing but a rubbish heap of details. one could question him all day without getting any real information. the party histories might still be true, after a fashion; they might even be completely true. he made a last attempt. ""perhaps i have not made myself clear,"" he said. ""what i'm trying to say is this. you have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before the revolution. in , for instance, you were already grown up. would you say, from what you can remember, that life in was better than it is now, or worse? if you could choose, would you prefer to live then or now?"" the old man looked meditatively at the darts board. he finished up his beer, more slowly than before. when he spoke it was with a tolerant, philosophic air, as though the beer had mellowed him. ""i know what you expect me to say,"" he said. ""you expect me to say as i'd sooner be young again. most people'd say they'd sooner be young, if you arst 'em. you got your 'ealth and strength when you're young. when you get to my time of life you ain't never well. i suffer something wicked from my feet, and my bladder's jest terrible. six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed. on the other 'and there's great advantages in being a old man. you ain't got the same worries. no truck with women, and that's a great thing. i ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you'd credit it. nor wanted to, what's more."" winston sat back against the window sill. it was no use going on. he was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. the extra half-liter was already working on him. winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, ""was life better before the revolution than it is now?"" would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. but in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. they remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago; but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. they were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. and when memory failed and written records were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested. at this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. he halted and looked up. he was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling houses. immediately above his head there hung three discolored metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. he seemed to know the place. of course! he was standing outside the junk shop where he had bought the diary. a twinge of fear went through him. it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again. and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway. if questioned, he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades. the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell. he was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. his hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. his spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. his voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles. ""i recognized you on the pavement,"" he said immediately. ""you're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album. that was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. cream laid, it used to be called. there's been no paper like that made for—oh, i dare say fifty years."" he peered at winston over the top of his spectacles. ""is there anything special i can do for you? or did you just want to look round?"" ""i was passing,"" said winston vaguely. ""i just looked in. i don't want anything in particular."" ""it's just as well,"" said the other, ""because i don't suppose i could have satisfied you."" he made an apologetic gesture with his soft-palmed hand. ""you see how it is; an empty shop, you"
orwell,"might say. between you and me, the antique trade's just about finished. no demand any longer, and no stock either. furniture, china, glass—it's all been broken up by degrees. and of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down. i haven't seen a brass candlestick in years."" the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. the floor-space was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture frames. in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as though they might include something interesting. as winston wandered toward the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up. it was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. there was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the color and the texture of the glass. at the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. ""what is it?"" said winston, fascinated. ""that's coral, that is,"" said the old man. ""it must have come from the indian ocean. they used to kind of embed it in the glass. that wasn't made less than a hundred years ago. more, by the look of it."" ""it's a beautiful thing,"" said winston. ""it is a beautiful thing,"" said the other appreciatively. ""but there's not many that'd say so nowadays."" he coughed. ""now, if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that'd cost you four dollars. i can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, i can't work it out, but it was a lot of money. but who cares about genuine antiques nowadays—even the few that's left?"" winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket. what appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. the soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. the thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. it was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. it was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a party member to have in his possession. anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two. ""there's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,"" he said. ""there's not much in it. just a few pieces. we'll do with a light if we're going upstairs."" he lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots. winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in. there was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace. an old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it. ""we lived here till my wife died,"" said the old man half apologetically. ""i'm selling the furniture off by little and little. now that's a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. but i dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome."" he was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. the thought flitted through winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. it was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob, utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock. ""there's no telescreen!"" he could not help murmuring. ""ah,"" said the old man, ""i never had one of those things. too expensive. and i never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. now that's a nice gateleg table in the corner there. though of course you'd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps."" there was a small bookcase in the other corner, and winston had already gravitated toward it. it contained nothing but rubbish. the hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else. it was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than ."
orwell,"the old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed. ""now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—"" he began delicately. winston came across to examine the picture. it was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. there was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. winston gazed at it for some moments. it seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue. ""the frame's fixed to the wall,"" said the old man, ""but i could unscrew it for you, i dare say."" ""i know that building,"" said winston finally. ""it's a ruin now. it's in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice."" ""that's right. outside the law courts. it was bombed in—oh, many years ago. it was a church at one time. st. clement's dane, its name was."" he smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added: "" oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's! "" ""what's that?"" said winston. ""oh— oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's. that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy. how it goes on i don't remember, but i do know it ended up, here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head. it was a kind of a dance. they held out their arms for you to pass tinder, and when they came to here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you. it was just names of churches. all the london churches were in it—all the principal ones, that is."" winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building. anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middle ages. the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books. statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered. ""i never knew it had been a church,"" he said. ""there's a lot of them left, really,"" said the old man, ""though they've been put to other uses. now, how did that rhyme go? ah! i've got it! oranges and lemons, say the hells of st. clement's, you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin's — there, now, that's as far as i can get. a farthing, that was a small copper coin, looked something like a cent."" ""where was st. martin's?"" said winston. ""st. martin's? that's still standing. it's in victory square, alongside the picture gallery. a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps."" winston knew the place well. it was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like. ""st. martin's in the fields it used to be called,"" supplemented the old man, ""though i don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts."" winston did not buy the picture. it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame. but he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not weeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shopfront—but charrington. mr. charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it. all the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through winston's head: oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's, you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin's! it was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost london that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing. he got away from mr. charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitering the street before stepping out of the door. he had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a month, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the center. the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. however—! yes, he thought again, he would come back. he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. he would buy the engraving of st. clement's danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr. charrington's memory. even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. for perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out onto the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window. he had even started humming"
orwell,"to an improvised tune— oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's, you owe me three farthings, say the— suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten meters away. it was the girl from the fiction department, the girl with dark hair. the light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. she looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him. for a few seconds winston was too paralyzed to move. then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. at any rate, one question was settled. there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. she must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure back street, kilometers distant from any quarter where party members lived. it was too great a coincidence. whether she was really an agent of the thought police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. it was enough that she was watching him. probably she had seen him go into the pub as well. it was an effort to walk. the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away. the worst thing was the pain in his belly. for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind. the street was a blind alley. winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his steps. as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. but he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. he could not run, he could not strike a blow. besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. he thought also of hurrying to the community center and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. but that too was impossible. a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet. it was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. the lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin. then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. but he did not open it at once. from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness. it was at night that they came for you, always at night. the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. undoubtedly some people did so. many of the disappearances were actually suicides. but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable. he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed. he might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough; but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one's own body. even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. and it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. on the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralyzed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth. he opened the diary. it was important to write something down. the woman on the telescreen had started a new song. her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. he tried to think of o'brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away. it would not matter if they killed you at once. to be killed was what you expected. but before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the groveling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair. why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever"
orwell,"failed to confess. when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time? he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o'brien. ""we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,"" o'brien had said to him. he knew what it meant, or thought he knew. the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. he put a cigarette in his mouth. half the tobacco promptly fell out onto his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. the face of big brother swam into his mind, displacing that of o'brien. just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. the face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting, but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark mustache? like a leaden knell the words came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. two i i t was the middle of the morning, and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory. a solitary figure was coming toward him from the other end of the long, brightly lit corridor. it was the girl with dark hair. four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk shop. as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same color as her overalls. probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were ""roughed in."" it was a common accident in the fiction department. they were perhaps four meters apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. she must have fallen right on the injured arm. winston stopped short. the girl had risen to her knees. her face had turned a milky yellow color against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain. a curious emotion stirred in winston's heart. in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him; in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. already he had instinctively started forward to help her. in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body. ""you're hurt?"" he said. ""it's nothing. my arm. it'll be all right in a second."" she spoke as though her heart were fluttering. she had certainly turned very pale. ""you haven't broken anything?"" ""no, i'm all right. it hurt for a moment, that's all."" she held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. she had regained some of her color, and appeared very much better. ""it's nothing,"" she repeated shortly. ""i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. thanks, comrade!"" and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. there was no question that she had done it intentionally. it was something small and flat. as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. it was a scrap of paper folded into a square. while he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded. obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it. for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water closets and read it at once. but that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously. he went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite toward him. ""five minutes,"" he told himself, ""five minutes at the very least!"" his heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention. whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political meaning. so far as he could see there were two possibilities. one, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the thought police, just as he had feared. he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. but there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress"
orwell,"it. this was, that the message did not come from the thought police at all, but from some kind of underground organization, perhaps the brotherhood existed after all! perhaps the girl was part of it! no doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him. and even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death—still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite. he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube. eight minutes had gone by. he readjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work toward him, with the scrap of paper on top of it. he flattened it out. on it was written, in a large unformed handwriting: i love you. for several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole. when he did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to make sure that the words were really there. for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly. lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment. he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week. he was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of big brother's head, two meters wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of spies. the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. she appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again. the afternoon was more bearable. immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party who was now under a cloud. this was the kind of thing that winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out. tonight was one of his nights at the community center. he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the center, took part in the solemn foolery of a ""discussion group,"" played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled ""ingsoc in relation to chess."" his soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the center. at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. it was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed—in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent—that he was able to think continuously. it was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. he knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note. obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone; but that was of no importance. he thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you. actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table. obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated. if she had worked"
orwell,"in the records department it might have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay, and he had no pretext for going there. if he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the ministry, which was bound to be noticed. as for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. by a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. actually, few people ever wrote letters. for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. in any case he did not know the girl's name, let alone her address. finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen. if he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round—if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words. for a week after this, life was like a restless dream. on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown. presumably she had been changed onto a later shift. they passed each other without a glance. on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. he did not touch the diary during those days. if there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. there was no inquiry he could make. she might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of oceania—worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him. the next day she reappeared. her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking plaster round her wrist. the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone. it was early, and the place was not very full. the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine. but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. he walked casually toward her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. she was perhaps three meters away from him. another two seconds would do it. then a voice behind him called, ""smith!"" he pretended not to hear. ""smith!"" repeated the voice, more loudly. it was no use. he turned round. a blond-headed, silly-faced young man named wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. it was not safe to refuse. after having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. it was too noticeable. he sat down with a friendly smile. the silly blond face beamed into his. winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it. the girl's table filled up a few minutes later. but she must have seen him coming toward her, and perhaps she would take the hint. next day he took care to arrive early. surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly moving, beedelike man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. as winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl's table. his hopes sank again. there was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. with ice at his heart winston followed. it was no use unless he could get the girl alone. at this moment there was a tremendous crash. the little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. he started to his feet with a malignant glance at winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. but it was all right. five seconds later, with a thundering heart, winston was sitting at the girl's table. he did not look at her. he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. it was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. a week had gone by since she had first approached. she would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind! it was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not"
orwell,"happen in real life. he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. in his vague way ampleforth was attached to winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him. there was perhaps a minute in which to act. both winston and the girl were eating steadily. the stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. in a low murmur winston began speaking. neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices. ""what time do you leave work?"" ""eighteen-thirty."" ""where can we meet?"" ""victory square, near the monument."" ""it's full of telescreens."" ""it doesn't matter if there's a crowd."" ""any signal?"" ""no. don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people. and don't look at me. just keep somewhere near me."" ""what time?"" ""nineteen hours."" ""all right."" ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table. the girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while winston stayed to smoke a cigarette. they did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another. winston was in victory square before the appointed time. he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which big brother's statue gazed southward toward the skies where he had vanquished the eurasian airplanes (the eastasian airplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the battle of airstrip one. in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell. at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. again the terrible fear seized upon winston. she was not coming, she had changed her mind! he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-colored pleasure from identifying st. martin's church, whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed ""you owe me three farthings."" then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. there were telescreens all round the pediment. but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. winston followed. as he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of eurasian prisoners was passing. already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square. winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd. soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. he was next to the girl. they were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them. a long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with submachine guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street. in the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together. their sad mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks, utterly incurious. occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg irons. truckload after truckload of the sad faces passed. winston knew they were there, but he saw them only intermittently. the girl's shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. she had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. she began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks. ""can you hear me?"" ""yes."" ""can you get sunday afternoon off?"" ""yes."" ""then listen carefully. you'll have to remember this. go to paddington station—"" with a sort of military precision that astonished him, she outlined the route that he was to follow. a half-hour railway journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometers along the road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead tree with moss on it. it was as though she had a map inside her head. ""can you remember all that?"" she murmured finally. ""yes."" ""you turn left, then right, then left again. and the gate's got no top bar."" ""yes. what time?"" ""about fifteen. you may have to wait. i'll get there by another way. are you sure you remember everything?"" ""yes."" ""then get away from me as quick as you can."" she need not have told him that. but for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. the trucks were still filing past, the people still insatiably gaping. at the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only from the party"
orwell,"members among the crowd, and had soon stopped. the prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. foreigners, whether from eurasia or from eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. one literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war criminals; the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labor camps. the round mongol faces had given way to faces of a more european type, dirty, bearded, and exhausted. from over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away again. the convoy was drawing to an end. in the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound together. it was almost time for winston and the girl to part. but at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze. it could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. he had time to learn every detail of her hand. he explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its row of calluses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. in the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what color the girl's eyes were. they were probably brown, but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. to turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. with hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at winston out of nests of hair. ii w inston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. under the trees to the left of them the ground was misty with bluebells. the air seemed to kiss one's skin. it was the second of may. from somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves. he was a bit early. there had been no difficulties about the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been. presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. in general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in london. there were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention. for distances of less than a hundred kilometers it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any party member they found there and asked awkward questions. however, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed. the train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather. the wooden-seated carriage in which he traveled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with ""in-laws"" in the country, and, as they freely explained to winston, to get hold of a little black-market butter. the lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle track which plunged between the bushes. he had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. the bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. he knelt down and began picking some, partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. he had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. he went on picking bluebells. it was the best thing to do. it might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. to look round was to show guilt. he picked another and another. a hand fell lightly on his shoulder. he looked up. it was the girl. she shook her head, evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers. his first feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all. the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him. already, on the walk from the station, the may sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of london in the pores of his skin. it occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. they came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. the"
orwell,"girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. when winston followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. the girl stopped and turned. ""here we are,"" she said. he was facing her at several paces' distance. as yet he did not dare move nearer to her. ""i didn't want to say anything in the lane,"" she went on, ""in case there's a mike hidden there. i don't suppose there is, but there could be. there's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice. we're all right here."" he still had not the courage to approach her. ""we're all right here?"" he repeated stupidly. ""yes. look at the trees."" they were small ashes, which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles, none of them thicker than one's wrist. ""there's nothing big enough to hide a mike in. besides, i've been here before."" they were only making conversation. he had managed to move closer to her now. she stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act. the bluebells had cascaded onto the ground. they seemed to have fallen of their own accord. he took her hand. ""would you believe,"" he said, ""that till this moment i didn't know what color your eyes were?"" they were brown, he noted, a rather light shade of brown, with dark lashes. ""now that you've seen what i'm really like, can you still bear to look at me?"" ""yes, easily."" ""i'm thirty-nine years old. i've got a wife that i can't get rid of. i've got varicose veins. i've got five false teeth."" ""i couldn't care less,"" said the girl. the next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms. at the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. the youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. she had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. he had pulled her down onto the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. but the truth was that he had no physical sensation except that of mere contact. all he felt was incredulity and pride. he was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. it was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women—he did not know the reason. the girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. she sat against him, putting her arm round his waist. ""never mind, dear. there's no hurry. we've got the whole afternoon. isn't this a splendid hide-out? i found it when i got lost once on a community hike. if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred meters away."" ""what is your name?"" said winston. ""julia. i know yours. it's winston—winston smith."" ""how did you find that out?"" ""i expect i'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. tell me, what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note?"" he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. it was even a sort of love offering to start off by telling the worst. ""i hated the sight of you,"" he said. ""i wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards. two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone. if you really want to know, i imagined that you had something to do with the thought police."" the girl laughed delightedly, evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise. ""not the thought police! you didn't honestly think that?"" ""well, perhaps not exactly that. but from your general appearance—merely because you're young and fresh and healthy, you understand—i thought that probably—"" ""you thought i was a good party member. pure in word and deed. banners, processions, slogans, games, community hikes—all that stuff. and you thought that if i had a quarter of a chance i'd denounce you as a thought-criminal and get you killed off?"" ""yes, something of that kind. a great many young girls are like that, you know."" ""it's this bloody thing that does it,"" she said, ripping off the scarlet sash of the junior anti-sex league and flinging it onto a bough. then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. she broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to winston. even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. it was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. but at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. the first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling. ""where did you get this stuff?"" he said. ""black market,"" she said indifferently. ""actually i am that sort of girl, to look at. i'm good at games. i was a troop leader in the spies. i do voluntary work three evenings a week for the junior anti-sex league. hours and hours i've spent pasting their bloody rot all over london. i always carry one end of a banner in the processions. i always look cheerful and"
orwell,"i never shirk anything. always yell with the crowd, that's what i say. it's the only way to be safe."" the first fragment of chocolate had melted on winston's tongue. the taste was delightful. but there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness, something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape, like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye. he pushed it away from him, aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not. ""you are very young,"" he said. ""you are ten or fifteen years younger than i am. what could you see to attract you in a man like me?"" ""it was something in your face. i thought i'd take a chance. i'm good at spotting people who don't belong. as soon as i saw you i knew you were against them ."" them, it appeared, meant the party, and above all the inner party, about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made winston feel uneasy, although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. a thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language. party members were supposed not to swear, and winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. julia, however, seemed unable to mention the party, and especially the inner party, without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways. he did not dislike it. it was merely one symptom of her revolt against the party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. they had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. he noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. they did not speak above a whisper. outside the clearing, julia said, it was better to go quietly. presently they had reached the edge of the little wood. she stopped him. ""don't go out into the open. there might be someone watching. we're all right if we keep behind the boughs."" they were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. the sunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces. winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. he knew it by sight. an old, close-bitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. in the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair. surely somewhere nearby, but out of sight, there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming. ""isn't there a stream somewhere near here?"" he whispered. ""that's right, there is a stream. it's at the edge of the next field, actually. there are fish in it, great big ones. you can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees, waving their tails."" ""it's the golden country—almost,"" he murmured. ""the golden country?"" ""it's nothing, really. a landscape i've seen sometimes in a dream."" ""look!"" whispered julia. a thrush had alighted on a bough not five meters away, almost at the level of their faces. perhaps it had not seen them. it was in the sun, they in the shade. it spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. in the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. winston and julia clung together, fascinated. the music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. for whom, for what, was that bird singing? no mate, no rival was watching it. what made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? he wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. he and julia had only spoken in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, beedelike man was listening intently—listening to that. but by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. it was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. he stopped thinking and merely felt. the girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. he pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water. their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. when they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply. the bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings. winston put his lips against her ear. "" now, "" he whispered. ""not here,"" she whispered back. ""come back to the hide-out. it's safer."" quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back to the clearing. when they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. they were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth. she stood looking at him for an instant,"
orwell,"then felt at the zipper of her overalls. and, yes! it was almost as in his dream. almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated. her body gleamed white in the sun. but for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile. he knelt down before her and took her hands in his. ""have you done this before?"" ""of course. hundreds of times—well, scores of times, anyway."" ""with party members?"" ""yes, always with party members."" ""with members of the inner party?"" ""not with those swine, no. but there's plenty that would if they got half a chance. they're not so holy as they make out."" his heart leapt. scores of times she had done it; he wished it had been hundreds—thousands. anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. who knew? perhaps the party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. if he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine! he pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face. ""listen. the more men you've had, the more i love you. do you understand that?"" ""yes, perfectly."" ""i hate purity, i hate goodness! i don't want any virtue to exist anywhere. i want everyone to be corrupt to the bones."" ""well then, i ought to suit you, dear. i'm corrupt to the bones."" ""you like doing this? i don't mean simply me; i mean the thing in itself?"" ""i adore it."" that was above all what he wanted to hear. not merely the love of one person, but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the party to pieces. he pressed her down upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. this time there was no difficulty. presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. the sun seemed to have grown hotter. they were both sleepy. he reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour. winston woke first. he sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. there was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely. the short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. it occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived. the young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling. but the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. he pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. in the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. but you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. no emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. it was a blow struck against the party. it was a political act. iii ""w e can come here once again,"" said julia. ""it's generally safe to use any hide-out twice. but not for another month or two, of course."" as soon as she woke up her demeanor had changed. she became alert and businesslike, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. it seemed natural to leave this to her. she obviously had a practical cunning which winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round london, stored away from innumerable community hikes. the route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different railway station. ""never go home the same way as you went out,"" she said, as though enunciating an important general principle. she would leave first, and winston was to wait half an hour before following her. she had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence. it was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. she would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing thread. if she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition. but with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting. ""and now i must go,"" she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions. ""i'm due back at nineteen-thirty. i've got to put in two hours for the junior anti-sex league, handing out leaflets, or something. isn't it bloody? give me a brush-down, would you. have i got any twigs in my hair? are you sure? then good-by, my love, good-by!"" she flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise. even now he had not found out her surname or her address. however, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication. as it happened, they never"
orwell,"went back to the clearing in the wood. during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love. that was in another hiding place known to julia, the belfry of a ruined church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. it was a good hiding place when once you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous. for the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time. in the street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. as they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the following day. julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which she called ""talking by installments."" she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. they were passing in silence down a side street (julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved and the air darkened, and winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. suddenly he became aware of julia's face a few centimeters from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. even her lips were white. she was dead! he clasped her against him, and found that he was kissing a live warm face. but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster. there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. winston's working week was sixty hours, julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide. julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free. she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior anti-sex league, preparing banners for hate week, making collections for the savings campaign, and suchlike activities. it paid, she said; it was camouflage. if you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members. so, one evening every week, winston spent four hours of paralyzing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens. when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up. it was a blazing afternoon. the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung. they sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrow slits and make sure that no one was coming. julia was twenty-six years old. she lived in a hostel with thirty other girls (""always in the stink of women! how i hate women!"" she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the fiction department. she enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. she was ""not clever,"" but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery. she could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the planning committee down to the final touching-up by the rewrite squad. but she was not interested in the finished product. she ""didn't much care for reading,"" she said. books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces. she had no memories of anything before the early sixties, and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. at school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. she had been a troop leader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior anti-sex league. she had always borne an excellent character. she had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in pornosec, the sub-section of the fiction department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. it was nicknamed muck house by the people who worked in it, she remarked. there she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like spanking stories or one night in a girls' school, to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal. ""what are these books like?"" said winston curiously. ""oh, ghastly rubbish. they're boring, really. they only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit. of course i was only on the kaleidoscopes. i was never in the rewrite squad."
orwell,"i'm not literary, dear—not even enough for that."" he learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec, except the head of the department, were girls. the theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled. ""they don't even like having married women there,"" she added. ""girls are always supposed to be so pure. here's one who isn't, anyway."" she had had her first love affair when she was sixteen, with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. ""and a good job too,"" said julia, ""otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed."" since then there had been various others. life as she saw it was quite simple. you wanted a good time; ""they,"" meaning the party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. she seemed to think it just as natural that ""they"" should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught. she hated the party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it. except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine. he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use. she had never heard of the brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. any kind of organized revolt against the party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid. the clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same. he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation—people who had grown up in the world of the revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the party as something unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog. they did not discuss the possibility of getting married. it was too remote to be worth thinking about. no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine, winston's wife, could somehow have been got rid of. it was hopeless even as a daydream. ""what was she like, your wife?"" said julia. ""she was—do you know the newspeak word goodthinkful? meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?"" ""no, i didn't know the word, but i know the kind of person, right enough."" he began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. she described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him. with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things; katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one. ""i could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,"" he said. he told her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week. ""she hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing it. she used to call it—but you'll never guess."" ""our duty to the party,"" said julia promptly. ""how did you know that?"" ""i've been at school too, dear. sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens. and in the youth movement. they rub it into you for years. i dare say it works in a lot of cases. but of course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites."" she began to enlarge upon the subject. with julia, everything came back to her own sexuality. as soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. unlike winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the party's sexual puritanism. it was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. what was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war fever and leader worship. the way she put it was: ""when you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything. they can't bear you to feel like that. they want you to be bursting with energy all the time. all this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. if you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about big brother and the three-year plans and the two minutes hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?"" that was very true, he thought. there was a direct, intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy. for how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force? the sex impulse was dangerous to the party, and the party had turned it to account. they had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. the family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children in almost the old-fashioned way. the children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations. the family had become in effect an extension of the thought police. it was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately. abruptly his mind went back to katharine. katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to"
orwell,"the thought police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. but what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which had brought the sweat out on his forehead. he began telling julia of something that had happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon, eleven years ago. it was three or four months after they were married. they had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in kent. they had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. it was a sheer drop often or twenty meters, with boulders at the bottom. there was nobody of whom they could ask the way. as soon as she realized that they were lost katharine became very uneasy. to be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrongdoing. she wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction. but at this moment winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them. one tuft was of two colors, magenta and brick red, apparently growing on the same root. he had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to katharine to come and look at it. ""look, katharine! look at those flowers. that clump down near the bottom. do you see they're two different colors?"" she had already turned to go, but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment. she even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing. he was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on her waist to steady her. at this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were. there was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not even a bird awake. in a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds. it was the hottest, sleepiest hour of the afternoon. the sun blazed down upon them, the sweat tickled his face. and the thought struck him.... ""why didn't you give her a good shove?"" said julia. ""i would have."" ""yes, dear, you would have. i would have, if i'd been the same person then as i am now. or perhaps i would—i'm not certain."" ""are you sorry you didn't?"" ""yes. on the whole i'm sorry i didn't."" they were sitting side by side on the dusty floor. he pulled her closer against him. her head rested on his shoulder, the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung. she was very young, he thought, she still expected something from life, she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing. ""actually it would have made no difference,"" he said. ""then why are you sorry you didn't do it?"" ""only because i prefer a positive to a negative. in this game that we're playing, we can't win. some kinds of failure are better than other kinds, that's all."" he felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. she always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. she would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated. in a way she realized that she herself was doomed, that sooner or later the thought police would catch her and kill her, but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose. all you needed was luck and cunning and boldness. she did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness, that the only victory lay in the far future, long after you were dead, that from the moment of declaring war on the party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse. ""we are the dead,"" he said. ""we're not dead yet,"" said julia prosaically. ""not physically. six months, a year—five years, conceivably. i am afraid of death. you are young, so presumably you're more afraid of it than i am. obviously we shall put it off as long as we can. but it makes very little difference. so long as human beings stay human, death and life are the same thing."" ""oh, rubbish! which would you sooner sleep with, me or a skeleton? don't you enjoy being alive? don't you like feeling: this is me, this is my hand, this is my leg, i'm real, i'm solid, i'm alive! don't you like this? "" she twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him. he could feel her breasts, ripe yet firm, through her overalls. her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigor into his. ""yes, i like that,"" he said. ""then stop talking about dying. and now listen, dear, we've got to fix up about the next time we meet. we may as well go back to the place in the wood. we've given it a good long rest. but you must get there by a different way this time. i've got it all planned out. you take the train—but look, i'll draw it out for you."" and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust, and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor. iv w inston looked round the shabby little room above mr. charrington's shop. beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster. the old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. in the corner, on the gateleg table, the"
orwell,"glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness. in the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups, provided by mr. charrington. winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil. he had brought an envelope full of victory coffee and some saccharine tablets. the clock's hands said seven-twenty, it was nineteen-twenty really. she was coming at nineteen-thirty. folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly. of all the crimes that a party member could commit, this one was the least possible to conceal. actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table. as he had foreseen, mr. charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room. he was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him. nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love affair. instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible. privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing. everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. and when they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself. he even, seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the house, one of them through the backyard, which gave on an alley. under the window somebody was singing. winston peeped out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. the june sun was still high in the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a norman pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothesline, pegging out a series of square white things which winston recognized as babies' diapers. whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto: "" it was only an 'opeless fanty, it passed like an ipril dye, but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred they 'ave stolen my 'eart awye! "" the tune had been haunting london for weeks past. it was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub-section of the music department. the words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator. but the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound. he could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks to the absence of a telescreen. folly, folly, folly! he thought again. it was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught. but the temptation of having a hiding place that was truly their own, indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. for some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of hate week. it was more than a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work onto everybody. finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day. they had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood. on the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. as usual winston hardly looked at julia as they drifted toward one another in the crowd, but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual. ""it's all off,"" she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak. ""tomorrow, i mean."" ""what?"" ""tomorrow afternoon. i can't come."" ""why not?"" ""oh, the usual reason. it's started early this time."" for a moment he was violently angry. during the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. at the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it. their first love-making had been simply an act of the will. but after the second time it was different. the smell of her hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him, or into the air all round him. she had become a physical necessity, something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. when she said that she could not come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. but just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. she gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. it struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not felt for her before, suddenly took hold of him. he wished that they were a married couple of ten years' standing. he wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now, but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household. he wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met. it was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day,"
orwell,"that the idea of renting mr. charrington's room had occurred to him. when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness. both of them knew that it was lunacy. it was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. as he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love. it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's consciousness. there it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as surely as precedes . one could not avoid it, but one could perhaps postpone it; and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious, willful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened. at this moment there was a quick step on the stairs. julia burst into the room. she was carrying a tool bag of coarse brown canvas, such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the ministry. he started forward to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly because she was still holding the tool bag. ""half a second,"" she said. ""just let me show you what i've brought. did you bring some of that filthy victory coffee? i thought you would. you can chuck it away again, because we shan't be needing it. look here."" she fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. underneath were a number of neat paper packets. the first packet that she passed to winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling. it was filled with some kind of heavy, sandlike stuff which yielded wherever you touched it. ""it isn't sugar?"" he said. ""real sugar?"" not saccharine, sugar. and here's a loaf of bread—proper white bread, not our bloody stuff—and a little pot of jam. and here's a tin of milk—but look! this is the one i'm really proud of. i had to wrap a bit of sacking round it, because—"" but she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up. the smell was already filling the room, a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood, but which one did occasionally meet with even now, blowing down a passageway before a door slammed, or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost again. ""it's coffee,"" he murmured, ""real coffee."" ""it's inner party coffee. there's a whole kilo here,"" she said. ""how did you manage to get hold of all these things?"" ""it's all inner party stuff. there's nothing those swine don't have, nothing. but of course waiters and servants and people pinch things, and—look, i got a little packet of tea as well."" winston had squatted down beside her. he tore open a corner of the packet. ""it's real tea. not blackberry leaves."" ""there's been a lot of tea about lately. they've captured india, or something,"" she said vaguely. ""but listen, dear. i want you to turn your back on me for three minutes. go and sit on the other side of the bed. don't go too near the window. and don't turn round till i tell you."" winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain. down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line. she took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling: "" they sye that time 'eals all things, they sye you can always forget; but the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years they twist my 'eartstrings yet! "" she knew the whole driveling song by heart, it seemed. her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged with a sort of happy melancholy. one had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content if the june evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing rubbish. it struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the party singing alone and spontaneously. it would even have seemed slightly unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about. ""you can turn round now,"" said julia. he turned round, and for a second almost failed to recognize her. what he had actually expected was to see her naked. but she was not naked. the transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. she had painted her face. she must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials. her lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. it was not very skilfully done, but winston's standards in such matters were not high. he had never before seen or imagined a woman of the party with cosmetics on her face. the improvement in her appearance was startling. with just a few dabs of color in the right places she had become not only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect. as he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. he remembered the half-darkness of a basement kitchen and a woman's cavernous mouth. it was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment it did not seem to matter. ""scent, too!"" he said. ""yes, dear, scent, too. and do you know what i'm going to do next? i'm going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers. i'll wear silk stockings and high-heeled shoes! in"
orwell,"this room i'm going to be a woman, not a party comrade."" they flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed. it was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence. until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meager body, with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discolored patch over his ankle. there were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth, and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them. ""it's sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?"" said julia. one never saw a double bed nowadays except in the homes of the proles. winston had occasionally slept in one in his boyhood; julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember. presently they fell asleep for a little while. when winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. he did not stir, because julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. most of her make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. a yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in the pan was boiling fast. down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street. he wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary. julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove. ""half that water's boiled away,"" she said. ""i'll get up and make some coffee in another moment. we've got an hour. what time do they cut the lights off at your flats?"" ""twenty-three thirty."" ""it's twenty-three at the hostel. but you have to get in earlier than that, because—hi! get out, you filthy brute!"" she suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a shoe from the floor, and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm, exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at goldstein, that morning during the two minutes hate. ""what was it?"" he said in surprise. ""a rat. i saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting. there's a hole down there. i gave him a good fright, anyway."" ""rats!"" murmured winston. ""in this room!"" ""they're all over the place,"" said julia indifferently as she lay down again. ""we've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel. some parts of london are swarming with them. did you know they attack children? yes, they do. in some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes. it's the great huge brown ones that do it. and the nasty thing is that the brutes always—"" "" don't go on! "" said winston, with his eyes tightly shut. ""dearest! you've gone quite pale. what's the matter? do they make you feel sick?"" ""of all horrors in the world—a rat!"" she pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body. he did not reopen his eyes immediately. for several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. it was always very much the same. he was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. in the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception, because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. with a deadly effort, like wrenching a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. he always woke up without discovering what it was, but somehow it was connected with what julia had been saying when he cut her short. ""i'm sorry,"" he said, ""it's nothing. i don't like rats, that's all."" ""don't worry, dear, we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here. i'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go. and next time we come here i'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly."" already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten. feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. julia got out of bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. the smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive. what was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine. with one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other, julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping herself down in the ragged armchair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. she brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. he took it out of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass. ""what is it, do you think?"" said julia. ""i don't"
orwell,"think it's anything—i mean, i don't think it was ever put to any use. that's what i like about it. it's a little chunk of history that they've forgotten to alter. it's a message from a hundred years ago, if one knew how to read it."" ""and that picture over there—"" she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall—""would that be a hundred years old?"" ""more. two hundred, i dare say. one can't tell. it's impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays."" she went over to look at it. ""here's where that brute stuck his nose out,"" she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. ""what is this place? i've seen it before somewhere."" ""it's a church, or at least it used to be. st. clement's dane its name was."" the fragment of rhyme that mr. charrington had taught him came back into his head, and he added half-nostalgically: "" oranges and lemons, say the hells of st. clement's! "" to his astonishment she capped the line: "" you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin's, when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey —"" ""i can't remember how it goes on after that. but anyway i remember it ends up, here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!' "" it was like the two halves of a countersign. but there must be another line after the bells of old bailey. perhaps it could be dug out of mr. charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted. ""who taught you that?"" he said. ""my grandfather. he used to say it to me when i was a little girl. he was vaporized when i was eight—at any rate, he disappeared. i wonder what a lemon was,"" she added inconsequently. ""i've seen oranges. they're a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin."" ""i can remember lemons,"" said winston. ""they were quite common in the fifties. they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them."" ""i bet that picture's got bugs behind it,"" said julia. ""i'll take it down and give it a good clean some day. i suppose it's almost time we were leaving. i must start washing this paint off. what a bore! i'll get the lipstick off your face afterwards."" winston did not get up for a few minutes more. the room was darkening. he turned over toward the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight. the inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself. there was such a depth of it, and yet it was almost as transparent as air. it was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. he had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. the paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was julia's life and his own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal. v s yme had vanished. a morning came, and he was missing from work; a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. on the next day nobody mentioned him. on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the records department to look at the notice board. one of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the chess committee, of whom syme had been one. it looked almost exactly as it had looked before—nothing had been crossed out—but it was one name shorter. it was enough. syme had ceased to exist; he had never existed. the weather was baking hot. in the labyrinthine ministry the windowless, air-conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature, but outside the pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the tubes at the rush hours was a horror. the preparations for hate week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the ministries were working overtime. processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxwork displays, film shows, telescreen programs all had to be organized; stands had to be erected, effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumors circulated, photographs faked. julia's unit in the fiction department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. winston, in addition to his regular work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of the times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. late at night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously febrile air. the rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumors. the new tune which was to be the theme song of hate week (the ""hate song,"" it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens. it had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. the proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular ""it was only a hopeless fancy."" the parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a piece of toilet paper. winston's evenings were fuller than ever. squads of volunteers, organized by parsons, were preparing the street for hate week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers. parsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundred meters"
orwell,"of bunting. he was in his native element and as happy as a lark. the heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings. he was everywhere at once, pushing, pulling, sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid-smelling sweat. a new poster had suddenly appeared all over london. it had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure of a eurasian soldier, three or four meters high, striding forward with expressionless mongolian face and enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. from whatever angle you looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed to be pointed straight at you. the thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of big brother. the proles, normally apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism. as though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual. one fell on a crowded film theater in stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. the whole population of the neighborhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting. another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground, and several dozen children were blown to pieces. there were further angry demonstrations, goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumor flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation. in the room over mr. charrington's shop, when they could get there, julia and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake of coolness. the rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat. it did not seem to matter. dirty or clean, the room was paradise. as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counterattack. four, five, six—seven times they met during the month of june. winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. he seemed to have lost the need for it. he had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided, leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped. the process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. now that they had a secure hiding place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time. what mattered was that the room over the junk shop should exist. to know that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. the room was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. mr. charrington, thought winston, was another extinct animal. he usually stopped to talk with mr. charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers. he led a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. he seemed glad of the opportunity to talk. wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman. with a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that—a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby's hair—never asking that winston should buy it, merely that he should admire it. to talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn-out musical box. he had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. there was one about four and twenty blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the death of poor cock robin. ""it just occurred to me you might be interested,"" he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment. but he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme. both of them knew—in a way, it was never out of their minds—that what was now happening could not last long. there were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. but there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence. so long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them. getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself was sanctuary. it was as when winston had gazed into the heart of"
orwell,"the paperweight, with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that once inside it time could be arrested. often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape. their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. or katharine would die, and by subtle maneuvrings winston and julia would succeed in getting married. or they would commit suicide together. or they would disappear, alter themselves out of recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory, and live out their lives undetected in a back street. it was all nonsense, as they both knew. in reality there was no escape. even the one plan that was practicable, suicide, they had no intention of carrying out. to hang on from day to day and from week to week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct, just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available. sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. even if the fabulous brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty of finding one's way into it. he told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and o'brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into o'brien's presence, announce that he was the enemy of the party, and demand his help. curiously enough this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. she was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe o'brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. but she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist. the tales about goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. times beyond number, at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals ""death to the traitors!"" during the two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at goldstein. yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent. she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties. such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination; and in any case the party was invincible. it would always exist, and it would always be the same. you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up. in some ways she was far more acute than winston, and far less susceptible to party propaganda. once when he happened in some connection to mention the war against eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fired by the government of oceania itself, ""just to keep people frightened."" this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life. often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her. she believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the party had invented airplanes. (in his own school-days, winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the party claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when julia was at school, it was already claiming the airplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) and when he told her that airplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting. after all, what did it matter who had invented airplanes? it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania, four years ago, had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia. it was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham; but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed. ""i thought we'd always been at war with eurasia,"" she said vaguely. it frightened him a little. the invention of airplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switch-over in the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. he argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. in the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time eastasia and not eurasia had been the enemy. but the issue still struck her as unimportant. ""who cares?"" she said impatiently. ""it's always one bloody war after another, and one knows the news is all lies anyway."" sometimes he talked to her of the"
orwell,"records department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. such things did not appear to horrify her. she did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths. he told her the story of jones, aaronson, and rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers. it did not make much impression on her. at first, indeed, she failed to grasp the point of the story. ""were they friends of yours?"" she said. ""no, i never knew them. they were inner party members. besides, they were far older men than i was. they belonged to the old days, before the revolution. i barely knew them by sight."" ""then what was there to worry about? people are being killed off all the time, aren't they?"" he tried to make her understand. ""this was an exceptional case. it wasn't just a question of somebody being killed. do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? if it survives anywhere, it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. already we know almost literally nothing about the revolution and the years before the revolution. every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been re-painted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. and that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. history has stopped. nothing exists except an endless present in which the party is always right. i know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when i did the falsification myself. after the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. the only evidence is inside my own mind, and i don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. just in that one instance, in my whole life, i did possess actual concrete evidence after the event—years after it."" ""and what good was that?"" ""it was no good, because i threw it away a few minutes later. but if the same thing happened today, i should keep it."" ""well, i wouldn't!"" said julia. ""i'm quite ready to take risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of old newspaper. what could you have done with it even if you had kept it?"" ""not much, perhaps. but it was evidence. it might have planted a few doubts here and there, supposing that i'd dared to show it to anybody. i don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime. but one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there—small groups of people banding themselves together, and gradually growing, and even leaving a few records behind, so that the next generation can carry on where we leave off."" ""i'm not interested in the next generation, dear. i'm interested in us. "" ""you're only a rebel from the waist downwards,"" he told her. she thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight. in the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest. whenever he began to talk of the principles of ingsoc, doublethink, the mutability of the past and the denial of objective reality, and to use newspeak words, she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing. one knew that it was all rubbish, so why let oneself be worried by it? she knew when to cheer and when to boo, and that was all one needed. if he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep. she was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position. talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. in a way, the world-view of the party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. they could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. by lack of understanding they remained sane. they simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird. vi i t had happened at last. the expected message had come. all his life, it seemed to him, he had been waiting for this to happen. he was walking down the long corridor at the ministry, and he was almost at the spot where julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him. the person, whoever it was, gave a small cough, evidently as a prelude to speaking. winston stopped abrupdy and turned. it was o'brien. at last they were face to face, and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away. his heart bounded violently. he would have been incapable of speaking. o'brien, however, had continued forward in the same movement, laying a friendly hand for a moment on winston's arm, so that the two of them were walking side by side. he began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of inner party members. ""i had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you,"" he said. ""i was reading one of your newspeak articles in the times the other day. you take a scholarly interest in newspeak, i believe?"" winston had recovered part of his self-possession. ""hardly scholarly,"" he said. ""i'm only an amateur. it's not my subject. i have never had anything to do with the actual construction"
orwell,"of the language."" ""but you write it very elegantly,"" said o'brien. ""that is not only my own opinion. i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert. his name has slipped my memory for the moment."" again winston's heart stirred painfully. it was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to syme. but syme was not only dead, he was abolished, an unperson. any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous. o'brien's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal, a code word. by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices. they had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor, but now o'brien halted. with the curious, disarming friendliness that he always managed to put into the gesture, he resettled his spectacles on his nose. then he went on: ""what i had really intended to say was that in your article i noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete. but they have only become so very recently. have you seen the tenth edition of the newspeak dictionary?"" ""no,"" said winston. ""i didn't think it had been issued yet. we are still using the ninth in the records department."" ""the tenth edition is not due to appear for some months, i believe. but a few advance copies have been circulated. i have one myself. it might interest you to look at it, perhaps?"" ""very much so,"" said winston, immediately seeing where this tended. ""some of the new developments are most ingenious. the reduction in the number of verbs—that is the point that will appeal to you, i think. let me see, shall i send a messenger to you with the dictionary? but i am afraid i invariably forget anything of that kind. perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you? wait. let me give you my address."" they were standing in front of a telescreen. somewhat absent-mindedly o'brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather-covered notebook and a gold ink pencil. immediately beneath the telescreen, in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing, he scribbled an address, tore out the page, and handed it to winston. ""i am usually at home in the evenings,"" he said. ""if not, my servant will give you the dictionary."" he was gone, leaving winston holding the scrap of paper, which this time there was no need to conceal. nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it, and some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers. they had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most. there was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have. it had been contrived as a way of letting winston know o'brien's address. this was necessary, because except by direct inquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived. there were no directories of any kind. ""if you ever want to see me, this is where i can be found,"" was what o'brien had been saying to him. perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary. but at any rate, one thing was certain. the conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist, and he had reached the outer edges of it. he knew that sooner or later he would obey o'brien's summons. perhaps tomorrow, perhaps after a long delay—he was not certain. what was happening was only the working-out of a process that had started years ago. the first step had been a secret, involuntary thought; the second had been the opening of the diary. he had moved from thoughts to words, and now from words to actions. the last step was something that would happen in the ministry of love. he had accepted it. the end was contained in the beginning. but it was frightening; or, more exactly, it was like a foretaste of death, like being a little less alive. even while he was speaking to o'brien, when the meaning of the words had sunk in, a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body. he had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave, and it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him. vii w inston had woken up with his eyes full of tears. julia rolled sleepily against him, murmuring something that might have been ""what's the matter?"" ""i dreamt—"" he began, and stopped short. it was too complex to be put into words. there was the dream itself, and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking. he lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream. it was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain. it had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances. the dream had also been comprehended by—indeed, in some sense it had consisted in—a gesture of the arm made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the jewish woman he had seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the helicopter blew them both to pieces. ""do you know,"" he said, ""that until this moment i believed i had murdered my mother?"" ""why did you murder her?"" said julia, almost asleep. ""i didn't murder her. not physically."" in the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother, and within a few moments of waking"
orwell,"the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back. it was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years. he was not certain of the date, but he could not have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened. his father had disappeared some time earlier; how much earlier, he could not remember. he remembered better the rackety, uneasy circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air raids and the sheltering in tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same color, the enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the distance—above all, the fact that there was never enough to eat. he remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which traveled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oilcake. when his father disappeared, his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. she seemed to have become completely spiritless. it was evident even to winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen. she did everything that was needed—cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece—always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an artist's lay-figure moving of its own accord. her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness. for hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made simian by thinness. very occasionally she would take winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything. he was aware, in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the never-mentioned thing that was about to happen. he remembered the room where they lived, a dark, close smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. there was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. he remembered his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. above all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes. he would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food, he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he would attempt a sniveling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share. his mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. she took it for granted that he, ""the boy,"" should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more. at every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. he would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister's plate. he knew that he was starving the other two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. the clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. between meals, if his mother did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf. one day a chocolate ration was issued. there had been no such issue for weeks or months past. he remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate. it was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces in those days) between the three of them. it was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts. suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else, winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece. his mother told him not to be greedy. there was a long, nagging argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances, bargainings. his tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. in the end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to winston, giving the other quarter to his sister. the little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. winston stood watching her for a moment. then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door. ""winston, winston!"" his mother called after him. ""come back! give your sister back her chocolate!"" he stopped, but he did not come back. his mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face. even now she was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was, that was on the point of happening. his sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a feeble wail. his mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast. something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. he turned and fled down the stairs, with the chocolate growing sticky in"
orwell,"his hand. he never saw his mother again. after he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours, until hunger drove him home. when he came back his mother had disappeared. this was already becoming normal at that time. nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister. they had not taken any clothes, not even his mother's overcoat. to this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead. it was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labor camp. as for his sister, she might have been removed, like winston himself, to one of the colonies for homeless children (reclamation centers, they were called) which had grown up as a result of the civil war; or she might have been sent to the labor camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die. the dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained. his mind went back to another dream of two months ago. exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy white-quilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him and drowning deeper every minute, but still looking up at him through the darkening water. he told julia the story of his mother's disappearance. without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position. ""i expect you were a beastly little swine in those days,"" she said indistinctly. ""all children are swine."" ""yes. but the real point of the story—"" from her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again. he would have liked to continue talking about his mother. he did not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman, still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. her feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. it would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. if you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still gave him love. when the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the child in her arms. it was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more chocolate, it did not avert the child's death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. the refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper. the terrible thing that the party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world. when once you were in the grip of the party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from doing, made literally no difference. whatever happened you vanished, and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again. you were lifted clean out of the stream of history. and yet to the people of only two generations ago, this would not have seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. they were governed by private loyalties which they did not question. what mattered were individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. the proles, it suddenly occurred to him, had remained in this condition. they were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. for the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world. the proles had stayed human. they had not become hardened inside. they had held onto the primitive emotions which he himself had to relearn by conscious effort. and in thinking this he remembered, without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk. ""the proles are human beings,"" he said aloud. ""we are not human."" ""why not?"" said julia, who had woken up again. he thought for a little while. ""has it ever occurred to you,"" he said, ""that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it's too late, and never see each other again?"" ""yes, dear, it has occurred to me, several times. but i'm not going to do it, all the same."" ""we've been lucky,"" he said ""but it can't last much longer. you're young. you look normal and innocent. if you keep clear of people like me, you might stay alive for another fifty years."" ""no. i've thought it all out. what you do, i'm going to do. and don't be too downhearted. i'm rather good at staying alive."" ""we may be together for another six months—a year—there's no knowing. at the end we're certain to be apart. do you realize how utterly alone we shall be? when once they get hold of us there will be nothing, literally nothing, that either of us can do for the other. if i confess they'll shoot you, and if i refuse to confess, they'll shoot you just the same. nothing that i can do or say, or stop myself from saying, will put off your death for as much as five minutes. neither of us will even know whether the"
orwell,"other is alive or dead. we shall be utterly without power of any kind. the one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another, although even that can't make the slightest difference."" ""if you mean confessing,"" she said, ""we shall do that, right enough. everybody always confesses. you can't help it. they torture you."" ""i don't mean confessing. confession is not betrayal. what you say or do doesn't matter; only feelings matter. if they could make me stop loving you—that would be the real betrayal."" she thought it over. ""they can't do that,"" she said finally. ""it's the one thing they can't do. they can make you say anything— anything —but they can't make you believe it. they can't get inside you."" ""no,"" he said a little more hopefully, ""no; that's quite true. they can't get inside you. if you can feel that staying human is worth while, even when it can't have any result whatever, you've beaten them."" he thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping ear. they could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. with all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands. one did not know what happened inside the ministry of love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning. facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden. they could be tracked down by inquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture. but if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it ultimately make? they could not alter your feelings; for that matter you could not alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. they could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable. viii t hey had done it, they had done it at last! the room they were standing in was long-shaped and softly lit. the telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur; the richness of the dark-blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet. at the far end of the room o'brien was sitting at a table under a green-shaded lamp, with a mass of papers on either side of him. he had not bothered to look up when the servant showed julia and winston in. winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak. they had done it, they had done it at last, was all he could think. it had been a rash act to come here at all, and sheer folly to arrive together; though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on o'brien's doorstep. but merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve. it was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling places of the inner party, or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived. the whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats, the richness and spaciousness of everything, the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco, the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down, the white-jacketed servants hurrying to and fro—everything was intimidating. although he had a good pretext for coming here, he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black-uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner, demand his papers, and order him to get out. o'brien's servant, however, had admitted the two of them without demur. he was a small, dark-haired man in a white jacket, with a diamond-shaped, completely expressionless face which might have been that of a chinese. the passage down which he led them was softly carpeted, with cream-papered walls and white wainscoting, all exquisitely clean. that too was intimidating. winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies. o'brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently. his heavy face, bent down so that one could see the line of the nose, looked both formidable and intelligent. for perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring. then he pulled the speakwrite toward him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the ministries: ""items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusful estimates machinery overheads stop end message."" he rose deliberately from his chair and came toward them across the soundless carpet. a little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the newspeak words, but his expression was grimmer than usual, as though he were not pleased at being disturbed. the terror that winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment. it seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake. for what evidence had he in reality that o'brien was any kind of political conspirator? nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark; beyond that, only his own secret imaginings, founded on a dream. he could not even fall back on the pretense that he had come to borrow the dictionary, because in that case julia's presence was impossible to explain. as o'brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him. he stopped, turned aside, and pressed a switch on the wall. there was a sharp snap. the voice had stopped. julia uttered a tiny sound, a sort of squeak of surprise. even in the midst of his panic, winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his"
orwell,"tongue. ""you can turn it off!"" he said. ""yes,"" said o'brien, ""we can turn it off. we have that privilege."" he was opposite them now. his solid form towered over the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. he was waiting, somewhat sternly, for winston to speak, but about what? even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted. nobody spoke. after the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent. the seconds marched past, enormous. with difficulty winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on o'brien's. then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile. with his characteristic gesture o'brien resettled his spectacles on his nose. ""shall i say it, or will you?"" he said. ""i will say it,"" said winston promptly. ""that thing is really turned off?"" ""yes, everything is turned off. we are alone."" ""we have come here because—"" he paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives. since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from o'brien, it was not easy to say why he had come here. he went on, conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious: ""we believe that there is some kind of conspiracy, some kind of secret organization working against the party, and that you are involved in it. we want to join it and work for it. we are enemies of the party. we disbelieve in the principles of ingsoc. we are thought-criminals. we are also adulterers. i tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy. if you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way, we are ready."" he stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the feeling that the door had opened. sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had come in without knocking. winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses. ""martin is one of us,"" said o'brien impassively. ""bring the drinks over here, martin. put them on the round table. have we enough chairs? then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort. bring a chair for yourself, martin. this is business. you can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes."" the little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet still with a servantlike air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye. it struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part, and that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment. o'brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. it aroused in winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding—a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. seen from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby. it had a sour-sweet smell. he saw julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity. ""it is called wine,"" said o'brien with a faint smile. ""you will have read about it in books, no doubt. not much of it gets to the outer party, i am afraid."" his face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: ""i think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. to our leader: to emmanuel goldstein."" winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about. like the glass paperweight or mr. charrington's half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. for some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. the truth was that after years of gin drinking he could barely taste it. he set down the empty glass. ""then there is such a person as goldstein?"" he said. ""yes, there is such a person, and he is alive. where, i do not know."" ""and the conspiracy—the organization? it is real? it is not simply an invention of the thought police?"" ""no, it is real. the brotherhood, we call it. you will never learn much more about the brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it. i will come back to that presently."" he looked at his wristwatch. ""it is unwise even for members of the inner party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour. you ought not to have come here together, and you will have to leave separately. you, comrade""—he bowed his head to julia—""will leave first. we have about twenty minutes at our disposal. you will understand that i must start by asking you certain questions. in general terms, what are you prepared to do?"" ""anything that we are capable of,"" said winston. o'brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing winston. he almost ignored julia, seeming to take it for granted that winston could speak for her. for a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes. he began asking his questions in a low, expressionless voice, as though this were a routine, a sort of catechism, most of whose answers were known to him already. ""you are prepared to give your lives?"" ""yes."" ""you are prepared to commit murder?"" ""yes."" ""to commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people?"" ""yes."" ""to betray your country to foreign powers?"" ""yes."" ""you are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the"
orwell,"minds of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases—to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the party?"" ""yes."" ""if, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child's face—are you prepared to do that?"" ""yes."" ""you are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock worker?"" ""yes."" ""you are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?"" ""yes."" ""you are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another again?"" ""no!"" broke in julia. it appeared to winston that a long time passed before he answered. for a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech. his tongue worked soundlessly, forming the opening syllables first of one word, then of the other, over and over again. until he had said it, he did not know which word he was going to say. ""no,"" he said finally. ""you did well to tell me,"" said o'brien. ""it is necessary for us to know everything."" he turned himself toward julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it: ""do you understand that even if he survives, it may be as a different person? we may be obliged to give him a new identity. his face, his movements, the shape of his hands, the color of his hair—even his voice would be different. and you yourself might have become a different person. our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition. sometimes it is necessary. sometimes we even amputate a limb."" winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at martin's mongolian face. there were no scars that he could see. julia had turned a shade paler, so that her freckles were showing, but she faced o'brien boldly. she murmured something that seemed to be assent. ""good. then that is settled."" there was a silver box of cigarettes on the table. with a rather absent-minded air o'brien pushed them toward the others, took one himself, then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro, as though he could think better standing. they were very good cigarettes, very thick and well-packed, with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper. o'brien looked at his wristwatch again. ""you had better go back to your pantry, martin,"" he said. ""i shall switch on in a quarter of an hour. take a good look at these comrades' faces before you go. you will be seeing them again. i may not."" exactly as they had done at the front door, the little man's dark eyes flickered over their faces. there was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. he was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to feel none. it occurred to winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression. without speaking or giving any kind of salutation, martin went out, closing the door silently behind him. o'brien was strolling up and down, one hand in the pocket of his black overalls, the other holding his cigarette. ""you understand,"" he said, ""that you will be fighting in the dark. you will always be in the dark. you will receive orders and you will obey them, without knowing why. later i shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in, and the strategy by which we shall destroy it. when you have read the book, you will be full members of the brotherhood. but between the general aims that we are fighting for, and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know anything. i tell you that the brotherhood exists, but i cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. from your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. you will have three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear. as this was your first contact, it will be preserved. when you receive orders, they will come from me. if we find it necessary to communicate with you, it will be through martin. when you are finally caught, you will confess. that is unavoidable. but you will have very little to confess, other than your own actions. you will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people. probably you will not even betray me. by that time i may be dead, or i shall have become a different person, with a different face."" he continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet. in spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements. it came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or manipulated a cigarette. more even than of strength, he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. however much in earnest he might be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. when he spoke of murder, suicide, venereal disease, amputated limbs, and altered faces, it was with a faint air of persiflage. ""this is unavoidable,"" his voice seemed to say; ""this is what we have got to do, unflinchingly. but this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again."" a wave of admiration, almost of worship, flowed out from winston toward o'brien. for the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of goldstein. when you looked at o'brien's powerful shoulders and his blunt-featured face, so ugly and yet so civilized, it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated. there was no stratagem that he was not equal to, no danger that he could not foresee. even julia seemed to be impressed. she had let her cigarette"
orwell,"go out and was listening intently. o'brien went on: ""you will have heard rumors of the existence of the brotherhood. no doubt you have formed your own picture of it. you have imagined, probably, a huge underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on walls, recognizing one another by code words or by special movements of the hand. nothing of the kind exists. the members of the brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a very few others. goldstein himself, if he fell into the hands of the thought police, could not give them a complete list of members, or any information that would lead them to a complete list. no such list exists. the brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense. nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible. you will never have anything to sustain you except the idea. you will get no comradeship and no encouragement. when finally you are caught, you will get no help. we never help our members. at most, when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell. you will have to get used to living without results and without hope. you will work for a while, you will be caught, you will confess, and then you will die. those are the only results that you will ever see. there is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime. we are the dead. our only true life is in the future. we shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. but how far away that future may be, there is no knowing. it might be a thousand years. at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little. we cannot act collectively. we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual, generation after generation. in the face of the thought police there is no other way."" he halted and looked for the third time at his wristwatch. ""it is almost time for you to leave, comrade,"" he said to julia. ""wait. the decanter is still half full."" he filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem. ""what shall it be this time?"" he said, still with the same faint suggestion of irony. ""to the confusion of the thought police? to the death of big brother? to humanity? to the future?"" ""to the past,"" said winston. ""the past is more important,"" agreed o'brien gravely. they emptied their glasses, and a moment later julia stood up to go. o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. it was important, he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very observant. as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence. he took another pace or two up and down, then stopped. ""there are details to be settled,"" he said. ""i assume that you have a hiding place of some kind?"" winston explained about the room over mr. charrington's shop. ""that will do for the moment. later we will arrange something else for you. it is important to change one's hiding place frequently. meanwhile i shall send you a copy of the hook ""—even o'brien, winston noticed, seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics—""goldstein's book, you understand, as soon as possible. it may be some days before i can get hold of one. there are not many in existence, as you can imagine. the thought police hunts them down and destroys them almost as fast as we can produce them. it makes very little difference. the book is indestructible. if the last copy were gone, we could reproduce it almost word for word. do you carry a brief case to work with you?"" he added. ""as a rule, yes."" ""what is it like?"" ""black, very shabby. with two straps."" ""black, two straps, very shabby—good. one day in the fairly near future—i cannot give a date—one of the messages among your morning's work will contain a misprinted word, and you will have to ask for a repeat. on the following day you will go to work without your brief case. at some time during the day, in the street, a man will touch you on the arm and say, 'i think you have dropped your brief case.' the one he gives you will contain a copy of goldstein's book. you will return it within fourteen days."" they were silent for a moment. ""there are a couple of minutes before you need go,"" said o'brien. ""we shall meet again—if we do meet again—"" winston looked up at him. ""in the place where there is no darkness?"" he said hesitantly. o'brien nodded without appearance of surprise. ""in the place where there is no darkness,"" he said, as though he had recognized the allusion. ""and in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave? any message? any question?"" winston thought. there did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask; still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding generalities. instead of anything directly connected with o'brien or the brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room over mr. charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame. almost at random he said: ""did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "" oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's? "" again o'brien nodded. with a sort"
orwell,"of grave courtesy he completed the stanza: "" oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement's, you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin's, when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey, when i grow rich, say the bells of shoreditch. "" ""you knew the last line!"" said winston. ""yes, i knew the last line. and now, i am afraid, it is time for you to go. but wait. you had better let me give you one of these tablets."" as winston stood up o'brien held out a hand. his powerful grip crushed the bones of winston's palm. at the door winston looked back, but o'brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind. he was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen. beyond him winston could see the writing table with its green-shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep-laden with papers. the incident was closed. within thirty seconds, it occurred to him, o'brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the party. ix w inston was gelatinous with fatigue. gelatinous was the right word. it had come into his head spontaneously. his body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. he felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it. all the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of nerves, bones, and skin. all sensations seemed to be magnified. his overalls fretted his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak. he had worked more than ninety hours in five days. so had everyone else in the ministry. now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. he could spend six hours in the hiding place and another nine in his own bed. slowly, in mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of mr. charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him. the heavy brief case that he was carrying bumped against his knees at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg. inside it was the book, which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at. on the sixth day of hate week, after the processions, the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the booming of guns—after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could have got their hands on the two thousand eurasian war criminals who were to be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably have torn them to pieces—at just this moment it had been announced that oceania was not after all at war with eurasia. oceania was at war with eastasia. eurasia was an ally. there was, of course, no admission that any change had taken place. merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once, that eastasia and not eurasia was the enemy. winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central london squares at the moment when it happened. it was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. the square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the spies. on a scarlet-draped platform an orator of the inner party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large, bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. a little rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed the air menacingly above his head. his voice, made metallic by the amplifiers, boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings, rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust aggressions, broken treaties. it was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened. at every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beastlike roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. the most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren. the speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried onto the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand. he unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. nothing altered in his voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different. without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd. oceania was at war with eastasia! the next moment there was a tremendous commotion. the banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong! quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. it was sabotage! the agents of goldstein had been at work! there was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. the spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. but within two or three minutes it was all over. the orator, still gripping the"
orwell,"neck of the microphone, his shoulders hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his speech. one minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd. the hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed. the thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in mid-sentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. but at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him. it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, ""excuse me, i think you've dropped your brief case."" he took the brief case abstractedly, without speaking. he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it. the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours. the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise. the orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary. oceania was at war with eastasia: oceania had always been at war with eastasia. a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete. reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound tracks, photographs—all had to be rectified at lightning speed. although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia, or the alliance with eastasia, should remain in existence anywhere. the work was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names. everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors; meals consisted of sandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen. each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half burying the speakwrite and overflowing onto the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat-enough pile to give him room to work. what was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical. often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination. even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable. by the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. it was like struggling with some crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish. in so far as he had time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of his ink pencil, was a deliberate lie. he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect. on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down. for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off. a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department. a mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been achieved. it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened. at twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning. winston, still carrying the brief case containing the book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid. with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above mr. charrington's shop. he was tired, but not sleepy any longer. he opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove, and put on a pan of water for coffee. julia would arrive presently; meanwhile there was the book. he sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief case. a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. the print also looked slightly irregular. the pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart easily, as though the book had passed through many hands. the inscription on the title page ran: the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism by e mmanuel g oldstein [winston began reading.] chapter . ignorance is strength. throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the neolithic age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the high, the middle, and the low. they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude toward one another, have varied from age to age; but the essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. the aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable— winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. he"
orwell,"was alone: no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand. the sweet summer air played against his cheek. from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children; in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. he settled deeper into the armchair and put his feet up on the fender. it was bliss, it was eternity. suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and reread every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at the third chapter. he went on reading: chapter . war is peace. the splitting-up of the world into three great superstates was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century. with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states, two of the three existing powers, eurasia and oceania, were already effectively in being. the third, eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting. the frontiers between the three superstates are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic land-mass, from portugal to the bering strait. oceania comprises the americas, the atlantic islands including the british isles, australasia, and the southern portion of africa. eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises china and the countries to the south of it, the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria, mongolia, and tibet. in one combination or another, these three superstates are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years. war, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century. it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting, and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference. this is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude toward it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. on the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties. the fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. in the centers of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. war has in fact changed its character. more exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance. motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon. to understand the nature of the present war—for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war—one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive. none of the three superstates could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination. they are too evenly matched, and their natural defenses are too formidable. eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific, eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants. secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about. with the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death. in any case, each of the three superstates is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries. in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labor power. between the frontiers of the superstates, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier, brazzaville, darwin, and hong kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth. it is for the possession of these thickly populated regions, and of the northern ice cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling. in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area. portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment. all of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods. but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labor. whichever power controls equatorial africa, or the countries of the middle east, or southern india, or the indonesian archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. the inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror,"
orwell,"and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labor power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas. the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the mediterranean; the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by oceania or by eastasia; in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stable; round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored; but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the heard and of each superstate always remains inviolate. moreover, the labor of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the world's economy. they add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war. by their labor the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. but if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would not be essentially different. the primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. at present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. the world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before , and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward. in the early twentieth century, the vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly and efficient—a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete—was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person. science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing. this failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society. as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago. certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired. nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there. from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. if the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. and in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process—by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute—the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. but it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction—indeed, in some sense was the destruction—of a hierarchical society. in a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motorcar or even an airplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. if it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. it was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while^‹wir remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. but in practice such a society could not long remain stable. for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. in the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. to return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. it conflicted with the tendency toward mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between and . the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented"
orwell,"from working and kept half alive by state charity. but this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. the essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labor. war is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labor power without producing anything that can be consumed. a floating fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labor that would build several hundred cargo ships. ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labors another floating fortress is built. in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. it is deliberate policy to keep even the favored groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. by the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the inner party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy—his large well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motorcar or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the outer party, and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ""the proles."" the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty and at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival. war, it will be seen, not only accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labor of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society. what is concerned here is not the morale of the masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the party itself. even the humblest party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph. in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war. it does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly. all that is needed is that a state of war should exist. the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. in his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones; but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink. meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world. all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith. it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. the search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. in oceania at the present day, science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. in newspeak there is no word for ""science."" the empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc. and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. the fields are cultivated with horse ploughs while books are written by machinery. but in matters of vital importance—meaning, in effect, war and police"
orwell,"espionage—the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least tolerated. the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve. one is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand. in so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter. the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with extraordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life. in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests, or in the australian desert, or on lost islands of the antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armor-plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an airplane as independent of its base as a sailing ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometers away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's center. but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none of the three superstates ever gains a significant lead on the others. what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover. although the party, according to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later. at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centers, chiefly in european russia, western europe, and north america. the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own power. thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later. and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years. helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battle-ship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. the tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use. and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated. none of the three superstates ever attempts any maneuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat. when any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally. the strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same. the plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible. it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world power, in preparation for another attack. this scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole: no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the british isles, which are geographically part of europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula. but this would violate the principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the oceanic level. the problem is the same for all three superstates. it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and colored slaves. even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion. war prisoners apart,"
orwell,"the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages. if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies. the sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia, or egypt, or java, or ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs. under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three superstates are very much the same. in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc, in eurasia it is called neo-bolshevism, and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as death-worship, but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self. the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense. actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all. everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare. it follows that the three superstates not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so. on the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. and, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing. their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory. meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought. here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character. in past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat. in the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality. all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency. so long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious. physical facts could not be ignored. in philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an airplane they had to make four. inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions. moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past. newspapers and history books were, of course, always colored and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practiced today would have been impossible. war was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. while wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible. but when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous. when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity. technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded. as we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important. efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed. nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police. since each of the three superstates is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practiced. reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life—the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-story windows, and the like. between life and death, and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that is all. cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down. the rulers of such a state are absolute, as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be. they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose. the war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. but though it is unreal it is not meaningless. it eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. war, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair. in the past, the ruling groups of all countries,"
orwell,"although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. the very word ""war,"" therefore, has become misleading. it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. the effect would be much the same if the three superstates, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. for in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed forever from the sobering influence of external danger. a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. this—although the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower sense—is the inner meaning of the party slogan: war is peace. winston stopped reading for a moment. somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek. the book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. in a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. it said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. it was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. the best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already. he had just turned back to chapter when he heard julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her. she dumped her brown tool bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms. it was more than a week since they had seen one another. ""i've got the book, "" he said as they disentangled themselves. ""oh, you've got it? good,"" she said without much interest, and almost immediately knelt down beside the oilstove to make the coffee. they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour. the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane. from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones. the brawny red-armed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard. there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song. julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep. he reached out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the bedhead. ""we must read it,"" he said. ""you too. all members of the brotherhood have to read it."" ""you read it,"" she said with her eyes shut. ""read it aloud. that's the best way. then you can explain it to me as you go."" the clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen. they had three or four hours ahead of them. he propped the book against his knees and began reading: chapter . ignorance is strength. throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the neolithic age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the high, the middle, and the low. they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude toward one another, have varied from age to age; but the essential structure of society has never altered. even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other. ""julia, are you awake?"" said winston. ""yes, my love, i'm listening. go on. it's marvelous."" he continued reading: the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. the aim of the high is to remain where they are. the aim of the middle is to change places with the high. the aim of the low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. for long periods the high seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves, or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. they are then overthrown by the middle, who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. as soon as they have reached their objective, the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the high. presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. of the three groups, only the low"
orwell,"are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. but no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no re-form or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer. from the point of view of the low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters. by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers. there then arose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life. this doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change. in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high. it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave. the middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. now, however, the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long. in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown. the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand. socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages. but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned. the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, ingsoc in oceania, neo-bolshevism in eurasia, death-worship, as it is commonly called, in eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating un freedom and in equality. these new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology. but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment. the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop. as usual, the high were to be turned out by the middle, who would then become the high; but this time, by conscious strategy, the high would be able to maintain their position permanently. the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century. the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable. but the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favored some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth. in earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable. inequality was the price of civilization. with the development of machine production, however, the case was altered. even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels. therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. in more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe in it. the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labor, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years. and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historic change. the heirs of the french, english, and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the like, and had even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent. but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian. the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable. every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about , practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years—imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages and the deportation of whole populations—not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive. it was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions and counterrevolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories. but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which"
orwell,"would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious. the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. these people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government. as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition. this last difference was cardinal. by comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act, and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking. even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards. part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance. the invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the process further. with the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed. the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time. after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into high, middle, and low. but the new high group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position. it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism. wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly. the so-called ""abolition of private property"" which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before; but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals. individually, no member of the party owns anything, except petty personal belongings. collectively, the party owns everything in oceania, because it controls everything and disposes of the products as it thinks fit. in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization. it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated, socialism must follow; and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. factories, mines, land, houses, transport—everything had been taken away from them; and since these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public property. ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist program, with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent. but the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this. there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power. either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern. these causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree. a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently. ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself. after the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared. each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. the second danger, also, is only a theoretical one. the masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed. the recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results, because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate. as for the problem of overproduction, which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare ( see chapter ), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch. from the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, underemployed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and skepticism in their own ranks. the problem, that is to say, is educational. it is a problem of continuously molding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it. the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way. given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already, the general structure of oceanic society. at the apex of the pyramid comes big brother. big"
orwell,"brother is infallible and all-powerful. every success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration. nobody has ever seen big brother. he is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. we may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. his function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are more easily felt toward an individual than toward an organization. below big brother comes the inner party, its numbers limited to six millions, or something less than two per cent of the population of oceania. below the inner party comes the outer party, which, if the inner party is described as the brain of the state, may be justly likened to the hands. below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as ""the proles,"" numbering perhaps eighty-five per cent of the population. in the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the low, for the slave populations of the equatorial lands, who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure. in principle, membership in these three groups is not hereditary. the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party. admission to either branch of the party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen. nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province by another. jews, negroes, south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party, and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital. oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows. except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. its rulers are not held together by blood ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. it is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines. there is far less to-and-fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the preindustrial ages. between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to rise. proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the party. the most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated. but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle. the party is not a class in the old sense of the word. it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. in the crucial years, the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition. the older kind of socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called ""class privilege,"" assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years. the essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living. a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors. the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself. who wields power is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same. all the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived. physical rebellion, or any preliminary move toward rebellion, is at present not possible. from the proletarians nothing is to be feared. left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is. they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining. what opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. in a party member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated. a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police. even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone. wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected. nothing that he does is indifferent. his friendships, his relaxations, his behavior"
orwell,"toward his wife and children, the expression of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized. not only any actual misdemeanor, but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever. on the other hand, his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behavior. in oceania there is no law. thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future. a party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the right instincts. many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc. if he is a person naturally orthodox (in newspeak a goodthinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion. but in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever. a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the party. the discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a skeptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline. the first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in newspeak, crimestop. crimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. it includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction. crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity. but stupidity is not enough. on the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body. oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible. but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. the keyword here is blackwhite. like so many newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. applied to a party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this. but it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. this demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in newspeak as doublethink. the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. the subsidiary reason is that the party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. he must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising. but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party. it is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right. it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted. for to change one's mind, or even one's policy, is a confession of weakness. if, for example, eurasia or eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the enemy. and if the facts say otherwise, then the facts must be altered. thus history is continuously rewritten. this day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the ministry of truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love. the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc. past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories. the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon. and since the party is in full control of all records, and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it. it also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past"
orwell,"can ever have existed. this holds good even when, as often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year. at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now. it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner. and if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done so. the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. it is learned by the majority of party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. in oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, ""reality control."" in newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises much else as well. doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. the process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc, since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies—all this is indispensably necessary. even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able—and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years—to arrest the course of history. all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft. either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown, or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were overthrown. they fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness. it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously. and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent. if one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes. it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating. in our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. in general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion: the more intelligent, the less sane. one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale. those whose attitude toward the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories. to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave. which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them. they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones. the slightly more favored workers whom we call ""the proles"" are only intermittently conscious of the war. when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. it is in the ranks of the party, and above all of the inner party, that the true war enthusiasm is found. world-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible. this peculiar linking-together of opposites—knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism—is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society. the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them. thus, the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism. it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason. it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty. even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts. the"
orwell,"ministry of peace concerns itself with war, the mnistry of truth with lies, the ministry of love with torture, and the ministry of plenty with starvation. these contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely. in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken. if human equality is to be forever averted—if the high, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently—then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity. but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored. it is: why should human equality be averted? supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time? here we reach the central secret. as we have seen, the mystique of the party, and above all of the inner party, depends upon doublethink. but deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the thought police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards. this motive really consists... winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound. it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past. she was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly. ""julia."" no answer. ""julia, are you awake?"" no answer. she was asleep. he shut the book, put it carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them. he had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret. he understood how; he did not understand why. chapter , like chapter , had not actually told him anything that he did not know; it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already. but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad. being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad. there was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad. a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow. he shut his eyes. the sun on his face and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy, confident feeling. he was safe, everything was all right. he fell asleep murmuring ""sanity is not statistical,"" with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom. x w hen he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty. he lay dozing for a little while; then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below: "" it was only an 'opeless fang, it passed like an ipril dye, but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred they 'ave stolen ny 'eart awye! "" the driveling song seemed to have kept its popularity. you still heard it all over the place. it had outlived the ""hate song."" julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed. ""i'm hungry,"" she said. ""let's make some more coffee. damn! the stove's gone out and the water's cold."" she picked the stove up and shook it. ""there's no oil in it."" ""we can get some from old charrington, i expect."" ""the funny thing is i made sure it was full. i'm going to put my clothes on,"" she added. ""it seems to have got colder."" winston also got up and dressed himself. the indefatigable voice sang on: "" they sye that time 'eals all things, they sye you can always forget; but the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years they twist ny 'eartstrings yet! "" as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window. the sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not shining into the yard any longer. the flagstones were wet as though they had just been washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and pale was the blue between the chimney pots. tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. he wondered whether she took in washing for a living or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. as he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful marelike buttocks protruded, it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. it had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an overripe turnip, could be beautiful. but it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? the solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower? ""she's beautiful,"" he murmured. ""she's a meter across the hips, easily,"" said julia. ""that is her style of beauty,"" said winston. he held julia's supple waist easily encircled by his arm. from the hip to the knee her flank was against his. out of their bodies no child would ever come. that"
orwell,"was the one thing they could never do. only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on the secret. the woman down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm heart, and a fertile belly. he wondered how many children she had given birth to. it might easily be fifteen. she had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of wildrose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning, cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children, then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. at the end of it she was still singing. the mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney pots into interminable distances. it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, in eurasia or eastasia as well as here. and the people under the sky were also very much the same—everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another's existence, held apart by walls of hatred and lies, and yet almost exactly the same—people who had never learned to think but who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world. if there was hope, it lay in the proles! without having read to the end of the hook, he knew that that must be goldstein's final message. the future belonged to the proles. and could he be sure that when their time came, the world they constructed would not be just as alien to him, winston smith, as the world of the party? yes, because at the least it would be a world of sanity. where there is equality there can be sanity. sooner or later it would happen: strength would change into consciousness. the proles were immortal; you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. in the end their awakening would come. and until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the party did not share and could not kill. ""do you remember,"" he said, ""the thrush that sang to us, that first day, at the edge of the wood?"" ""he wasn't singing to us,"" said julia. ""he was singing to please himself. not even that. he was just singing."" the birds sang, the proles sang, the party did not sing. all round the world, in london and new york, in africa and brazil, and in the mysterious, forbidden lands beyond the frontiers, in the streets of paris and berlin, in the villages of the endless russian plain, in the bazaars of china and japan—everywhere stood the same solid unconquerable figure, made monstrous by work and childbearing, toiling from birth to death and still singing. out of those mighty loins a race of conscious beings must one day come. you were the dead; theirs was the future. but you could share in that future if you kept alive the mind as they kept alive the body, and passed on the secret doctrine that two plus two make four. ""we are the dead,"" he said. ""we are the dead,"" echoed julia dutifully. ""you are the dead,"" said an iron voice behind them. they sprang apart. winston's entrails seemed to have turned into ice. he could see the white all round the irises of julia's eyes. her face had turned a milky yellow. the smear of rouge that was still on each cheekbone stood out sharply, almost as though unconnected with the skin beneath. ""you are the dead,"" repeated the iron voice. ""it was behind the picture,"" breathed julia. ""it was behind the picture,"" said the voice. ""remain exactly where you are. make no movement until you are ordered."" it was starting, it was starting at last! they could do nothing except stand gazing into one another's eyes. to run for life, to get out of the house before it was too late—no such thought occurred to them. unthinkable to disobey the iron voice from the wall. there was a snap as though a catch had been turned back, and a crash of breaking glass. the picture had fallen to the floor, uncovering the telescreen behind it. ""now they can see us,"" said julia. ""now we can see you,"" said the voice. ""stand out in the middle of the room. stand back to back. clasp your hands behind your heads. do not touch one another."" they were not touching, but it seemed to him that he could feel julia's body shaking. or perhaps it was merely the shaking of his own. he could just stop his teeth from chattering, but his knees were beyond his control. there was a sound of trampling boots below, inside the house and outside. the yard seemed to be full of men. something was being dragged across the stones. the woman's singing had stopped abrupdy. there was a long, rolling clang, as though the washtub had been flung across the yard, and then a confusion of angry shouts which ended in a yell of pain. ""the house is surrounded,"" said winston. ""the house is surrounded,"" said the voice. he heard julia snap her teeth together. ""i suppose we may as well say good-by,"" she said. ""you may as well say good-by,"" said the voice. and then another quite different voice, a thin, cultivated voice which winston had the impression of having heard before, struck in: ""and by the way, while we are on the subject, here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head! "" something crashed onto the bed behind winston's back. the head of"
orwell,"a ladder had been thrust through the window and had burst in the frame. someone was climbing through the window. there was a stampede of boots up the stairs. the room was full of solid men in black uniforms, with iron-shod boots on their feet and truncheons in their hands. winston was not trembling any longer. even his eyes he barely moved. one thing alone mattered: to keep still, to keep still and not give them an excuse to hit you! a man with a smooth prizefighter's jowl in which the mouth was only a slit paused opposite him, balancing his truncheon meditatively between thumb and forefinger. winston met his eyes. the feeling of nakedness, with one's hands behind one's head and one's face and body all exposed, was almost unbearable. the man protruded the tip of a white tongue, licked the place where his lips should have been, and then passed on. there was another crash. someone had picked up the glass paperweight from the table and smashed it to pieces on the hearthstone. the fragment of coral, a tiny crinkle of pink like a sugar rosebud from a cake, rolled across the mat. how small, thought winston, how small it always was! there was a gasp and a thump behind him, and he received a violent kick on the ankle which nearly flung him off his balance. one of the men had smashed his fist into julia's solar plexus, doubling her up like a pocket ruler. she was thrashing about on the floor, fighting for breath. winston dared not turn his head even by a millimeter, but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. even in his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly pain which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. he knew what it was like: the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to breathe. then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack. winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that was the last he saw of her. he stood dead still. no one had hit him yet. thoughts which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his mind. he wondered whether they had got mr. charrington. he wondered what they had done to the woman in the yard. he noticed that he badly wanted to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago. he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. but the light seemed too strong. would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an august evening? he wondered whether after all he and julia had mistaken the time—had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought eight-thirty on the following morning. but he did not pursue the thought further. it was not interesting. there was another, lighter step in the passage. mr. charrington came into the room. the demeanor of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more subdued. something had also changed in mr. charrington's appearance. his eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight. ""pick up those pieces,"" he said sharply. a man stooped to obey. the cockney accent had disappeared; winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the telescreen. mr. charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. also he was not wearing his spectacles. he gave winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. he was still recognizable, but he was not the same person any longer. his body had straightened, and seemed to have grown bigger. his face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked a complete transformation. the black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed shorter. it was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. it occurred to winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a member of the thought police. three i h e did not know where he was. presumably he was in the ministry of love; but there was no way of making certain. he was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. concealed lamps flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. a bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. there were four telescreens, one in each wall. there was a dull aching in his belly. it had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. but he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. it might be twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. he still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. since he was arrested he had not been fed. he sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee. he had already learned to sit still. if you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. but the craving for food"
orwell,"was growing upon him. what he longed for above all was a piece of bread. he had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. it was even possible—he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg—that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. in the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket. ""smith!"" yelled a voice from the telescreen. "" smith w! hands out of pockets in the cells!"" he sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. he did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time. it was a noisy, evil-smelling place. they had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. the majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. he had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanor between the party prisoners and the others. the party prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody. they yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order. on the other hand, some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spy-hole in the door. the guards, too, treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly. there was much talk about the forced-labor camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. it was ""all right"" in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. there were bribery, favoritism, and racketeering of every kind, there were homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. the positions of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. all the dirty jobs were done by the politicals. there was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description: drug peddlers, thieves, bandits, black marketeers, drunks, prostitutes. some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them. an enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one at each corner. they wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh bones. the woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of ""f——bastards!"" then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off winston's knees onto the bench. ""beg pardon, dearie,"" she said. ""i wouldn't 'a sat on you, only the buggers put me there. they dono 'ow to treat a lady, do they?"" she paused, patted her breast, and belched. ""pardon,"" she said, ""i ain't meself, quite."" she leant forward and vomited copiously on the floor. ""thass better,"" she said, leaning back with closed eyes. ""never keep it down, thass what i say. get it up while it's fresh on your stomach, like."" she revived, turned to have another look at winston, and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. she put a vast arm round his shoulder and drew him toward her, breathing beer and vomit into his face. ""wass your name, dearie?"" she said. ""smith,"" said winston. ""smith?"" said the woman. ""thass funny. my name's smith too. why,"" she added sentimentally, ""i might be your mother!"" she might, thought winston, be his mother. she was about the right age and physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat after twenty years in a forced-labor camp. no one else had spoken to him. to a surprising extent the ordinary criminals ignored the party prisoners. ""the pol its ,"" they called them, with a sort of uninterested contempt. the party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody, and above all of speaking to one another. only once, when two party members, both women, were pressed close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few hurriedly whispered words; and in particular a reference to something called ""room one-oh-one,"" which he did not understand. it might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. the dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. when it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food. when it grew better, panic took hold of him. there were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. he felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself groveling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. he hardly thought of julia. he could not fix his mind on her. he loved her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the"
orwell,"rules of arithmetic. he felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her. he thought oftener of o'brien, with a flickering hope. o'brien must know that he had been arrested. the brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. but there was the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. there would be perhaps five seconds before the guards could rush into the cell. the blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trembling from the smallest pain. he was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance. it was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it. sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell. it should have been easy, but he always lost count at some point or another. more often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it was. at one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. in this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. it was the place with no darkness: he saw now why o'brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. in the ministry of love there were no windows. his cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. he moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground. there was a sound of marching boots outside. the steel door opened with a clang. a young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. he motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. the poet ampleforth shambled into the cell. the door clanged shut again. ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then began to wander up and down the cell. he had not yet noticed winston's presence. his troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a meter above the level of winston's head. he was shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. he was also several days away from a shave. a scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements. winston roused himself a little from his lethargy. he must speak to ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. it was even conceivable that ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade. ""ampleforth,"" he said. there was no yell from the telescreen. ampleforth paused, mildly startled. his eyes focused themselves slowly on winston. ""ah, smith!"" he said. ""you, too!"" ""what are you in for?"" ""to tell you the truth—"" he sat down awkwardly on the bench opposite winston. ""there is only one offense, is there not?"" he said. ""and have you committed it?"" ""apparently i have."" he put a hand to his forehead and pressed his temples for a moment, as though trying to remember something. ""these things happen,"" he began vaguely. ""i have been able to recall one instance—a possible instance. it was an indiscretion, undoubtedly. we were producing a definitive edition of the poems of kipling. i allowed the word 'god' to remain at the end of a line. i could not help it!"" he added almost indignantly, raising his face to look at winston. ""it was impossible to change the line. the rhyme was 'rod.' do you realize that there are only twelve rhymes to 'rod' in the entire language? for days i had racked my brains. there was no other rhyme."" the expression on his face changed. the annoyance passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. a sort of intellectual warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the dirt and scrubby hair. ""has it ever occurred to you,"" he said, ""that the whole history of english poetry has been determined by the fact that the english language lacks rhymes?"" no, that particular thought had never occurred to winston. nor, in the circumstances, did it strike him as very important or interesting. ""do you know what time of day it is?"" he said. ampleforth looked startled again. ""i had hardly thought about it. they arrested me—it could be two days ago—perhaps three."" his eyes flitted round the walls, as though he half expected to find a window somewhere. ""there is no difference between night and day in this place. i do not see how one can calculate the time."" they talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, then round the other. the telescreen barked at him to keep still. time passed. twenty minutes, an hour—it was difficult to judge. once more there was a sound of boots outside. winston's entrails contracted. soon, very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come. the door opened. the cold-faced young officer stepped into the cell. with a brief movement"
orwell,"of the hand he indicated ampleforth. ""room ,"" he said. ampleforth marched clumsily out between the guards, his face vaguely perturbed, but uncomprehending. what seemed like a long time passed. the pain in winston's belly had revived. his mind sagged round and round on the same track, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. he had only six thoughts. the pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; o'brien; julia; the razor blade. there was another spasm in his entrails; the heavy boots were approaching. as the door opened, the wave of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. parsons walked into the cell. he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports shirt. this time winston was startled into self-forgetfulness. "" you here!"" he said. parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. he began walking jerkily up and down, evidently unable to keep still. each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was apparent that they were trembling. his eyes had a wide-open, staring look, as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance. ""what are you in for?"" said winston. ""thoughtcrime!"" said parsons, almost blubbering. the tone of his voice implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be applied to himself. he paused opposite winston and began eagerly appealing to him: ""you don't think they'll shoot me, do you, old chap? they don't shoot you if you haven't actually done anything—only thoughts, which you can't help? i know they give you a fair hearing. oh, i trust them for that! they'll know my record, won't they? you know what kind of chap i was. not a bad chap in my way. not brainy, of course, but keen. i tried to do my best for the party, didn't i? i'll get off with five years, don't you think? or even ten years? a chap like me could make himself pretty useful in a labor camp. they wouldn't shoot me for going off the rails just once?"" ""are you guilty?"" said winston. ""of course i'm guilty!"" cried parsons with a servile glance at the telescreen. ""you don't think the party would arrest an innocent man, do you?"" his froglike face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly sanctimonious expression. ""thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,"" he said sententiously. ""it's insidious. it can get hold of you without your even knowing it. do you know how it got hold of me? in my sleep! yes, that's a fact. there i was, working away, trying to do my bit—never knew i had any bad stuff in my mind at all. and then i started talking in my sleep. do you know what they heard me saying?"" he sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to utter an obscenity. ""'down with big brother!' yes, i said that! said it over and over again, it seems. between you and me, old man, i'm glad they got me before it went any further. do you know what i'm going to say to them when i go up before the tribunal? 'thank you,' i'm going to say, 'thank you for saving me before it was too late.'"" ""who denounced you?"" said winston. ""it was my little daughter,"" said parsons with a sort of doleful pride. ""she listened at the keyhole. heard what i was saying, and nipped off to the patrols the very next day. pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh? i don't bear her any grudge for it. in fact i'm proud of her. it shows i brought her up in the right spirit, anyway."" he made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times casting a longing glance at the lavatory pan. then he suddenly ripped down his shorts. ""excuse me, old man,"" he said. ""i can't help it. it's the waiting."" he plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. winston covered his face with his hands. ""smith!"" yelled the voice from the telescreen. "" smith w! uncover your face. no faces covered in the cells."" winston uncovered his face. parsons used the lavatory, loudly and abundantly. it then turned out that the plug was defective, and the cell stank abominably for hours afterwards. parsons was removed. more prisoners came and went mysteriously. one, a woman, was consigned to ""room ,"" and, winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different color when she heard the words. a time came when, if it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. there were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. all sat very still. opposite winston there sat a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large, harmless rodent. his fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there. his pale-gray eyes flitted timorously from face to face, and turned quickly away again when he caught anyone's eye. the door opened, and another prisoner was brought in whose appearance sent a momentary chill through winston. he was a commonplace, mean-looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. but what was startling was the emaciation of his face. it was like a skull. because of its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something. the man sat down on the bench at a little distance from winston. winston did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his"
orwell,"eyes. suddenly he realized what was the matter. the man was dying of starvation. the same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. there was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. the eyes of the chinless man kept flitting toward the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. presently he began to fidget on his seat. at last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man. there was a furious, deafening roar from the telescreen. the chinless man jumped in his tracks. the skull-faced man had quickly thrust his hands behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he refused the gift. ""bumstead!"" roared the voice. "" bumstead j! let fall that piece of bread."" the chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the floor. ""remain standing where you are,"" said the voice. ""face the door. make no movement."" the chinless man obeyed. his large pouchy cheeks were quivering uncontrollably. the door clanged open. as the young officer entered and stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms and shoulders. he took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth. the force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. his body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. for a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. a very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of him. then he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. amid a stream of blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth. the prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on their knees. the chinless man climbed back into his place. down one side of his face the flesh was darkening. his mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-colored mass with a black hole in the middle of it. from time to time a little blood dripped onto the breast of his overalls. his gray eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for his humiliation. the door opened. with a small gesture the officer indicated the skull-faced man. ""room ,"" he said. there was a gasp and a flurry at winston's side. the man had actually flung himself on his knees on the floor, with his hand clasped together. ""comrade! officer!"" he cried. ""you don't have to take me to that place! haven't i told you everything already? what else is it you want to know? there's nothing i wouldn't confess, nothing! just tell me what it is and i'll confess it straight off. write it down and i'll sign it—anything! not room !"" ""room ,"" said the officer. the man's face, already very pale, turned a color winston would not have believed possible. it was definitely, unmistakably, a shade of green. ""do anything to me!"" he yelled. ""you've been starving me for weeks. finish it off and let me die. shoot me. hang me. sentence me to twenty-five years. is there somebody else you want me to give away? just say who it is and i'll tell you anything you want. i don't care who it is or what you do to them. i've got a wife and three children. the biggest of them isn't six years old. you can take the whole lot of them and cut their throats in front of my eyes, and i'll stand by and watch it. but not room !"" ""room ,"" said the officer. the man looked frantically round at the other prisoners, as though with some idea that he could put another victim in his own place. his eyes settled on the smashed face of the chinless man. he flung out a lean arm. ""that's the one you ought to be taking, not me!"" he shouted. ""you didn't hear what he was saying after they bashed his face. give me a chance and i'll tell you every word of it. he's the one that's against the party, not me."" the guards stepped forward. the man's voice rose to a shriek. ""you didn't hear him!"" he repeated. ""something went wrong with the telescreen. he's the one you want. take him, not me!"" the two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. but just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench. he had set up a wordless howling, like an animal. the guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with astonishing strength. for perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him. the prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight in front of them. the howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. then there was a different kind of cry. a kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands. they dragged him to his feet. ""room ,"" said the officer. the man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight gone out of him. a long time passed. if it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning; if morning, it was afternoon. winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. the pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about,"
orwell,"unreproved by the telescreen. the piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. at the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. his mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. the humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. he would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned. sometimes with a fading hope he thought of o'brien and the razor blade. it was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. more dimly he thought of julia. somewhere or other she was suffering, perhaps far worse than he. she might be screaming with pain at this moment. he thought: ""if i could save julia by doubling my own pain, would i do it? yes, i would."" but that was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. he did not feel it. in this place you could not feel anything, except pain and the foreknowledge of pain. besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason whatever that your own pain should increase? but that question was not answerable yet. the boots were approaching again. the door opened. o'brien came in. winston started to his feet. the shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. for the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen. ""they've got you too!"" he cried. ""they got me a long time ago,"" said o'brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. he stepped aside. from behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand. ""you knew this, winston,"" said o'brien. ""don't deceive yourself. you did know it—you have always known it."" yes, he saw now, he had always known it. but there was no time to think of that. all he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. it might fall anywhere: on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow— the elbow! he had slumped to his knees, almost paralyzed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. everything had exploded into yellow light. inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! the light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. the guard was laughing at his contortions. one question at any rate was answered. never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. in the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm. ii h e was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move. light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. o'brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. at the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe. even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually. he had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. how long he had been down there he did not know. since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight. besides, his memories were not continuous. there had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing. with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. there was a long range of crimes—espionage, sabotage, and the like—to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course. the confession was a formality, though the torture was real. how many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember. always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. there were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. there were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness. there were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of"
orwell,"pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: ""i will confess, but not yet. i must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. three more kicks, two more kicks, and then i will tell them what they want."" sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes onto the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again. there were also longer periods of recovery. he remembered them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. he remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin washbasin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in search of broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep. the beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory. his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted—he thought, he could not be sure—ten or twelve hours at a stretch. these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. they slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction, until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session. most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done. when his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to sniveling tears. in the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. he became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed whatever was demanded of him. his sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew. he confessed to the assassination of eminent party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as . he confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. he confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive. he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known. it was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. besides, in a sense it was all true. it was true that he had been the enemy of the party, and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed. there were also memories of another kind. they stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them. he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. the eyes grew larger and more luminous. suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up. he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials, under dazzling lights. a man in a white coat was reading the dials. there was a tramp of heavy boots outside. the door clanged open. the waxen-faced officer marched in, followed by two guards. ""room ,"" said the officer. the man in the white coat did not turn round. he did not look at winston either; he was looking only at the dials. he was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometer wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the top of his voice. he was confessing everything, even the things he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. he was relating the entire history of his life to an audience who knew it already. with him were the guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, o'brien, julia, mr. charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with laughter. some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened. everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare, understood, forgiven. he was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had heard o'brien's voice. all through his interrogation, although he"
orwell,"had never seen him, he had had the feeling that o'brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. it was o'brien who was directing everything. it was he who set the guards onto winston and who prevented them from killing him. it was he who decided when winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. it was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. he was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. and once—winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness—a voice murmured in his ear: ""don't worry, winston; you are in my keeping. for seven years i have watched over you. now the turning point has come. i shall save you, i shall make you perfect."" he was not sure whether it was o'brien's voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, ""we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,"" in that other dream, seven years ago. he did not remember any ending to his interrogation. there was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. he was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. his body was held down at every essential point. even the back of his head was gripped in some manner. o'brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. his face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. he was older than winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight of fifty. under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face. ""i told you,"" said o'brien, ""that if we met again it would be here."" ""yes,"" said winston. without any warning except a slight movement of o'brien's hand, a wave of pain flooded his body. it was a frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him. he did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap. he set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible. ""you are afraid,"" said o'brien, watching his face, ""that in another moment something is going to break. your especial fear is that it will be your backbone. you have a vivid mental picture of the vertebrae snapping apart and the spinal fluid dripping out of them. that is what you are thinking, is it not, winston?"" winston did not answer. o'brien drew back the lever on the dial. the wave of pain receded almost as quickly as it had come. ""that was forty,"" said o'brien. ""you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to a hundred. will you please remember, throughout our conversation, that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any moment and to whatever degree i choose. if you tell me any lies, or attempt to prevaricate in any way, or even fall below your usual level of intelligence, you will cry out with pain, instantly. do you understand that?"" ""yes,"" said winston. o'brien's manner became less severe. he resettled his spectacles thoughtfully, and took a pace or two up and down. when he spoke his voice was gentle and patient. he had the air of a doctor, a teacher, even a priest, anxious to explain and persuade rather than to punish. ""i am taking trouble with you, winston,"" he said, ""because you are worth trouble. you know perfectly well what is the matter with you. you have known it for years, though you have fought against the knowledge. you are mentally deranged. you suffer from a defective memory. you are unable to remember real events, and you persuade yourself that you remember other events which never happened. fortunately it is curable. you have never cured yourself of it, because you did not choose to. there was a small effort of the will that you were not ready to make. even now, i am well aware, you are clinging to your disease under the impression that it is a virtue. now we will take an example. at this moment, which power is oceania at war with?"" ""when i was arrested, oceania was at war with eastasia."" ""with eastasia. good. and oceania has always been at war with eastasia, has it not?"" winston drew in his breath. he opened his mouth to speak and then did not speak. he could not take his eyes away from the dial. ""the truth, please, winston. your truth. tell me what you think you remember."" ""i remember that until only a week before i was arrested, we were not at war with eastasia at all. we were in alliance with them. the war was against eurasia. that had lasted for four years. before that—"" o'brien stopped him with a movement of die hand. ""another example,"" he said. ""some years ago you had a very serious delusion indeed. you believed that three men, three one-time party members named jones, aaronson, and rutherford—men who were executed for treachery and sabotage after making the fullest possible confession—were not guilty of the crimes they were charged with. you believed that you had seen unmistakable documentary evidence proving that their confessions were false. there was a certain photograph about which you had a hallucination. you believed that you"
orwell,"had actually held it in your hands. it was a photograph something like this."" an oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between o'brien's fingers. for perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of winston's vision. it was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. it was the photograph. it was another copy of the photograph of jones, aaronson, and rutherford at the party function in new york, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. for only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. but he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! he made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. it was impossible to move so much as a centimeter in any direction. for the moment he had even forgotten the dial. all he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it. ""it exists!"" he cried. ""no,"" said o'brien. he stepped across the room. there was a memory hole in the opposite wall. o'brien lifted the grating. unseen, the frail slip of paper was whirling away on the current of warm air; it was vanishing in a flash of flame. o'brien turned away from the wall. ""ashes,"" he said. ""not even identifiable ashes. dust. it does not exist. it never existed."" ""but it did exist! it does exist! it exists in memory. i remember it. you remember it."" ""i do not remember it,"" said o'brien. winston's heart sank. that was doublethink. he had a feeling of deadly helplessness. if he could have been certain that o'brien was lying, it would not have seemed to matter. but it was perfectly possible that o'brien had really forgotten the photograph. and if so, then already he would have forgotten his denial of remembering it, and forgotten the act of forgetting. how could one be sure that it was simply trickery? perhaps that lunatic dislocation in the mind could really happen: that was the thought that defeated him. o'brien was looking down at him speculatively. more than ever he had the air of a teacher taking pains with a wayward but promising child. ""there is a party slogan dealing with the control of the past,"" he said. ""repeat it, if you please."" ""'who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,'"" repeated winston obediently. ""'who controls the present controls the past,'"" said o'brien, nodding his head with slow approval. ""is it your opinion, winston, that the past has real existence?"" again the feeling of helplessness descended upon winston. his eyes flitted toward the dial. he not only did not know whether ""yes"" or ""no"" was the answer that would save him from pain; he did not even know which answer he believed to be the true one. o'brien smiled faintly. ""you are no metaphysician, winston,"" he said. ""until this moment you had never considered what is meant by existence. i will put it more precisely. does the past exist concretely, in space? is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?"" ""no."" ""then where does the past exist, if at all?"" ""in records. it is written down."" ""in records. and—?"" ""in the mind. in human memories."" ""in memory. very well, then. we, the party, control all records, and we control all memories. then we control the past, do we not?"" ""but how can you stop people remembering things?"" cried winston, again momentarily forgetting the dial. ""it is involuntary. it is outside oneself. how can you control memory? you have not controlled mine!"" o'brien's manner grew stern again. he laid his hand on the dial. ""on the contrary,"" he said, "" you have not controlled it. that is what has brought you here. you are here because you have failed in humility, in self-discipline. you would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. you preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. only the disciplined mind can see reality, winston. you believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. you also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. when you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. but i tell you, winston, that reality is not external. reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes; only in the mind of the party, which is collective and immortal. whatever the party holds to be truth is truth. it is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the party. that is the fact that you have got to relearn, winston. it needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will. you must humble yourself before you can become sane."" he paused for a few moments, as though to allow what he had been saying to sink in. ""do you remember,"" he went on, ""writing in your diary, 'freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four?"" ""yes,"" said winston. o'brien held up his left hand, its back toward winston, with the thumb hidden and the four fingers extended. ""how many fingers am i holding up, winston?"" ""four."" ""and if the party says that it is not four but five—then how many?"" ""four."" the word ended in a gasp of pain. the needle of the dial had shot up to fifty-five. the sweat had sprung out all over winston's body. the air tore into his lungs and issued again in deep groans which even by clenching his teeth he could not stop. o'brien watched him, the four fingers still extended. he drew back the lever. this time the pain was only slightly eased. ""how many fingers, winston?"" ""four."" the needle went up to sixty. ""how many"
orwell,"fingers, winston?"" ""four! four! what else can i say? four!"" the needle must have risen again, but he did not look at it. the heavy, stern face and the four fingers filled his vision. the fingers stood up before his eyes like pillars, enormous, blurry, and seeming to vibrate, but unmistakably four. ""how many fingers, winston?"" ""four! stop it, stop it! how can you go on? four! four!"" ""how many fingers, winston?"" ""five! five! five!"" ""no, winston, that is no use. you are lying. you still think there are four. how many fingers, please?"" ""four! five! four! anything you like. only stop it, stop the pain!"" abrupdy he was sitting up with o'brien's arm round his shoulders. he had perhaps lost consciousness for a few seconds. the bonds that had held his body down were loosened. he felt very cold, he was shaking uncontrollably, his teeth were chattering, the tears were rolling down his cheeks. for a moment he clung to o'brien like a baby, curiously comforted by the heavy arm round his shoulders. he had the feeling that o'brien was his protector, that the pain was something that came from outside, from some other source, and that it was o'brien who would save him from it. ""you are a slow learner, winston,"" said o'brien gently. ""how can i help it?"" he blubbered. ""how can i help seeing what is in front of my eyes? two and two are four."" ""sometimes, winston. sometimes they are five. sometimes they are three. sometimes they are all of them at once. you must try harder. it is not easy to become sane."" he laid winston down on the bed. the grip on his limbs tightened again, but the pain had ebbed away and the trembling had stopped, leaving him merely weak and cold. o'brien motioned with his head to the man in the white coat, who had stood immobile throughout the proceedings. the man in the white coat bent down and looked closely into winston's eyes, felt his pulse, laid an ear against his chest, tapped here and there; then he nodded to o'brien. ""again,"" said o'brien. the pain flowed into winston's body. the needle must be at seventy, seventy-five. he had shut his eyes this time. he knew that the fingers were still there, and still four. all that mattered was somehow to stay alive until the spasm was over. he had ceased to notice whether he was crying out or not. the pain lessened again. he opened his eyes. o'brien had drawn back the lever. ""how many fingers, winston?"" ""four. i suppose there are four. i would see five if i could. i am trying to see five."" ""which do you wish: to persuade me that you see five, or really to see them?"" ""really to see them."" ""again,"" said o'brien. perhaps the needle was at eighty—ninety. winston could only intermittently remember why the pain was happening. behind his screwed-up eyelids a forest of fingers seemed to be moving in a sort of dance, weaving in and out, disappearing behind one another and reappearing again. he was trying to count them, he could not remember why. he knew only that it was impossible to count them, and that this was somehow due to the mysterious identity between five and four. the pain died down again. when he opened his eyes it was to find that he was still seeing the same thing. innumerable fingers, like moving trees, were still streaming past in either direction, crossing and recrossing. he shut his eyes again. ""how many fingers am i holding up, winston?"" ""i don't know. i don't know. you will kill me if you do that again. four, five, six—in all honesty i don't know."" ""better,"" said o'brien. a needle slid into winston's arm. almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. the pain was already half-forgotten. he opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at o'brien. at sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. if he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on o'brien arm. he had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped die pain. the old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether o'brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. o'brien was a person who could be talked to. perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. o'brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. it made no difference. in some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates; somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk. o'brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. when he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone. ""do you know where you are, winston?"" he said. ""i don't know. i can guess. in the ministry of love."" ""do you know how long you have been here?"" ""i don't know. days, weeks, months—i think it is months."" ""and why do you imagine that we bring people to this place?"" ""to make them confess."" ""no, that is not the reason. try again."" ""to punish them."" ""no!"" exclaimed o'brien. his voice had changed extraordinarily, and his face had suddenly become both stern and animated. ""no! not merely to extract your confession, nor to punish you. shall i tell you why we have brought you here? to cure you! to make you sane! will you understand, winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? we are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. the party is not interested in the"
orwell,"overt act; the thought is all we care about. we do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them. do you understand what i mean by that?"" he was bending over winston. his face looked enormous because of its nearness, and hideously ugly because it was seen from below. moreover it was filled with a sort of exaltation, a lunatic intensity. again winston's heart shrank. if it had been possible he would have cowered deeper into the bed. he felt certain that o'brien was about to twist the dial out of sheer wantonness. at this moment, however, o'brien turned away. he took a pace or two up and down. then he continued less vehemently: ""the first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms. you have read of the religious persecutions of the past. in the middle ages there was the inquisition. it was a failure. it set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. for every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. why was that? because the inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant; in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the inquisitor who burned him. later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. there were the german nazis and the russian communists. the russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the inquisition had done. and they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. they wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. and yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. the dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. once again, why was it? in the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. we do not make mistakes of that kind. all the confessions that are uttered here are true. we make them true. and above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. you must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, winston. posterity will never hear of you. you will be lifted clean out from the stream of history. we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. nothing will remain of you: not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. you will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. you will never have existed."" then why bother to torture me? thought winston, with a momentary bitterness. o'brien checked his step as though winston had uttered the thought aloud. his large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed. ""you are thinking,"" he said, ""that since we intend to destroy you utterly, so that nothing that you say or do can make the smallest difference—in that case, why do we go to the trouble of interrogating you first? that is what you were thinking, was it not?"" ""yes,"" said winston. o'brien smiled slightly. ""you are a flaw in the pattern, winston. you are a stain that must be wiped out. did i not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? we are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. when finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. we do not destroy the heretic because he resists us; so long as he resists us we never destroy him. we convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. we burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. we make him one of ourselves before we kill him. it is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. in the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. even the victim of the russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. but we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. the command of the old despotisms was 'thou shalt not.' the command of the totalitarians was 'thou shalt.' our command is 'thou art.' no one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. everyone is washed clean. even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed—jones, aaronson, and rutherford—in the end we broke them down. i took part in their interrogation myself. i saw them gradually worn down, whimpering, groveling, weeping—and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. by the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. there was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of big brother. it was touching to see how they loved him. they begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean."" his voice had grown almost dreamy. the exaltation, the lunatic enthusiasm, was still in his face. he is not pretending, thought winston; he is not a hypocrite; he believes every word he says. what most oppressed him was the consciousness of his own intellectual inferiority. he watched the heavy"
orwell,"yet graceful form strolling to and fro, in and out of the range of his vision. o'brien was a being in all ways larger than himself. there was no idea that he had ever had, or could have, that o'brien had not long ago known, examined, and rejected. his mind contained winston's mind. but in that case how could it be true that o'brien was mad? it must be he, winston, who was mad. o'brien halted and looked down at him. his voice had grown stern again. ""do not imagine that you will save yourself, winston, however completely you surrender to us. no one who has once gone astray is ever spared. and even if we chose to let you live out the natural term of your life, still you would never escape from us. what happens to you here is forever. understand that in advance. we shall crush you down to the point from which there is no coming back. things will happen to you from which you could not recover, if you lived a thousand years. never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling. everything will be dead inside you. never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity. you will be hollow. we shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves."" he paused and signed to the man in the white coat. winston was aware of some heavy piece of apparatus being pushed into place behind his head. o'brien had sat down beside the bed, so that his face was almost on a level with winston's. ""three thousand,"" he said, speaking over winston's head to the man in the white coat. two soft pads, which felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against winston's temples. he quailed. there was pain coming, a new kind of pain. o'brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his. ""this time it will not hurt,"" he said. ""keep your eyes fixed on mine."" at this moment there was a devastating explosion, or what seemed like an explosion, though it was not certain whether there was any noise. there was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light. winston was not hurt, only prostrated. although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened, he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position. a terrific, painless blow had flattened him out. also something had happened inside his head. as his eyes regained their focus he remembered who he was, and where he was, and recognized the face that was gazing into his own; but somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness, as though a piece had been taken out of his brain. ""it will not last,"" said o'brien. ""look me in the eyes. what country is oceania at war with?"" winston thought. he knew what was meant by oceania, and that he himself was a citizen of oceania. he also remembered eurasia and eastasia; but who was at war with whom he did not know. in fact he had not been aware that there was any war. ""i don't remember."" ""oceania is at war with eastasia. do you remember that now?"" ""yes."" ""oceania has always been at war with eastasia. since the beginning of your life, since the beginning of the party, since the beginning of history, the war has continued without a break, always the same war. do you remember that?"" ""yes."" ""eleven years ago you created a legend about three men who had been condemned to death for treachery. you pretended that you had seen a piece of paper which proved them innocent. no such piece of paper ever existed. you invented it, and later you grew to believe in it. you remember now the very moment at which you first invented it. do you remember that?"" ""yes."" ""just now i held up the fingers of my hand to you. you saw five fingers. do you remember that?"" ""yes."" o'brien held up the fingers of his left hand, with the thumb concealed. ""there are five fingers there. do you see five fingers?"" ""yes."" and he did see them, for a fleeting instant, before the scenery of his mind changed. he saw five fingers, and there was no deformity. then everything was normal again, and the old fear, the hatred, and the bewilderment came crowding back again. but there had been a moment—he did not know how long, thirty seconds, perhaps—of luminous certainty, when each new suggestion of o'brien's had filled up a patch of emptiness and become absolute truth, and when two and two could have been three as easily as five, if that were what was needed. it had faded out before o'brien had dropped his hand; but though he could not recapture it, he could remember it, as one remembers a vivid experience at some remote period of one's life when one was in effect a different person. ""you see now,"" said o'brien, ""that it is at any rate possible."" ""yes,"" said winston. o'brien stood up with a satisfied air. over to his left winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampoule and draw back the plunger of a syringe. o'brien turned to winston with a smile. in almost the old manner he resettled his spectacles on his nose. ""do you remember writing in your diary,"" he said, ""that it did not matter whether i was a friend or an enemy, since i was at least a person who understood you and could be talked to? you were right. i enjoy talking to you. your mind appeals to me. it resembles my own mind except that you happen to be insane. before we bring the session to an end you can ask me a few questions, if you choose."" ""any question i like?"" ""anything."" he saw that winston's eyes were upon the dial. ""it is switched off. what is your"
orwell,"first question?"" ""what have you done with julia?"" said winston. o'brien smiled again. ""she betrayed you, winston. immediately—unreservedly. i have seldom seen anyone come over to us so promptly. you would hardly recognize her if you saw her. all her rebelliousness, her deceit, her folly, her dirty-mindedness—everything has been burned out of her. it was a perfect conversion, a textbook case."" ""you tortured her."" o'brien left this unanswered. ""next question,"" he said. ""does big brother exist?"" ""of course he exists. the party exists. big brother is the embodiment of the party."" ""does he exist in the same way as i exist?"" ""you do not exist,"" said o'brien. once again the sense of helplessness assailed him. he knew, or he could imagine, the arguments which proved his own nonexistence; but they were nonsense, they were only a play on words. did not the statement, ""you do not exist,"" contain a logical absurdity? but what use was it to say so? his mind shriveled as he thought of the unanswerable, mad arguments with which o'brien would demolish him. ""i think i exist,"" he said wearily. ""i am conscious of my own identity. i was born, and i shall die. i have arms and legs. i occupy a particular point in space. no other solid object can occupy the same point simultaneously. in that sense, does big brother exist?"" ""it is of no importance. he exists."" ""win big brother ever die?"" ""of course not. how could he die? next question."" ""does the brotherhood exist?"" ""that, winston, you will never know. if we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is yes or no. as long as you live, it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind."" winston lay silent. his breast rose and fell a little faster. he still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. he had got to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. there was a trace of amusement in o'brien's face. even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam. he knows, thought winston suddenly, he knows what i am going to ask! at the thought the words burst out of him: ""what is in room ?"" the expression on o'brien's face did not change. he answered drily: ""you know what is in room , winston. everyone knows what is in room ."" he raised a finger to the man in the white coat. evidently the session was at an end. a needle jerked into winston's arm. he sank almost instantly into deep sleep. iii ""t here are three stages in your reintegration,"" said o'brien. ""there is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. it is time for you to enter upon the second stage."" as always, winston was lying flat on his back. but of late his bonds were looser. they still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. the dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. he could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough; it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that o'brien pulled the lever. sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. he could not remember how many sessions there had been. the whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time—weeks, possibly—and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two. ""as you lie there,"" said o'brien, ""you have often wondered—you have even asked me—why the ministry of love should expend so much time and trouble on you. and when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. you could grasp the mechanics of the society you lived in, but not its underlying motives. do you remember writing in your diary, 'i understand how; i do not understand why'? it was when you thought about 'why' that you doubted your own sanity. you have read the book, goldstein's book, or parts of it, at least. did it tell you anything that you did not know already?"" ""you have read it?"" said winston. ""i wrote it. that is to say, i collaborated in writing it. no book is produced individually, as you know."" ""is it true, what it says?"" ""as description, yes. the program it sets forth is nonsense. the secret accumulation of knowledge—a gradual spread of enlightenment—ultimately a proletarian rebellion—the overthrow of the party. you foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. it is all nonsense. the proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. they cannot. i do not have to tell you the reason; you know it already. if you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. there is no way in which the party can be overthrown. the rule of the party is forever. make that the starting point of your thoughts."" he came closer to the bed. ""forever!"" he repeated. ""and now let us get back to the question of 'how' and 'why.' you understand well enough how the party maintains itself in power. now tell me why we cling to power. what is our motive? why should we want power? go on, speak,"" he added as winston remained silent. nevertheless winston did not speak for another moment or two. a feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. the faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into o'brien's face. he knew in advance what o'brien would say: that the party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. that it sought power because men in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty"
orwell,"or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. that the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. that the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. the terrible thing, thought winston, the terrible thing was that when o'brien said this he would believe it. you could see it in his face. o'brien knew everything. a thousand times better than winston, he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the party kept them there. he had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. what can you do, thought winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy? ""you are ruling over us for our own good,"" he said feebly. ""you believe that human beings are not fit to govern themselves, and therefore—"" he started and almost cried out. a pang of pain had shot through his body. o'brien had pushed the lever of the dial up to thirty-five. ""that was stupid, winston, stupid!"" he said. ""you should know better than to say a thing like that."" he pulled the lever back and continued: ""now i will tell you the answer to my question. it is this. the party seeks power entirely for its own sake. we are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness; only power, pure power. what pure power means you will understand presently. we are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. all the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. they pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. we are not like that. we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. power is not a means; it is an end. one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. the object of persecution is persecution. the object of torture is torture. the object of power is power. now do you begin to understand me?"" winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of o'brien's face. it was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. there were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones. o'brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer. ""you are thinking,"" he said, ""that my face is old and tired. you are thinking that i talk of power, and yet i am not even able to prevent the decay of my own body. can you not understand, winston, that the individual is only a cell? the weariness of the cell is the vigor of the organism. do you die when you cut your fingernails?"" he turned away from the bed and began strolling up and down again, one hand in his pocket. ""we are the priests of power,"" he said. ""god is power. but at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. it is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. the first thing you must realize is that power is collective. the individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. you know the party slogan: 'freedom is slavery.' has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? slavery is freedom. alone—free—the human being is always defeated. it must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures. but if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the party so that he is the party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. the second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. over the body—but, above all, over the mind. power over matter—external reality, as you would call it—is not important. already our control over matter is absolute."" for a moment winston ignored the dial. he made a violent effort to raise himself into a sitting position, and merely succeeded in wrenching his body painfully. ""but how can you control matter?"" he burst out. ""you don't even control the climate or the law of gravity. and there are disease, pain, death—"" o'brien silenced him by a movement of his hand. ""we control matter because we control the mind. reality is inside the skull. you will learn by degrees, winston. there is nothing that we could not do. invisibility, levitation—anything. i could float off this floor like a soap bubble if i wish to. i do not wish to, because the party does not wish it. you must get rid of those nineteenth-century ideas about the laws of nature. we make the laws of nature."" ""but you do not! you are not even masters of this planet. what about eurasia and eastasia? you have not conquered them yet."" ""unimportant. we shall conquer them when it suits us. and if we did not, what difference would it make? we can shut them out of existence. oceania is"
orwell,"the world."" ""but the world itself is only a speck of dust. and man is tiny—helpless! how long has he been in existence? for millions of years the earth was uninhabited."" ""nonsense. the earth is as old as we are, no older. how could it be older? nothing exists except through human consciousness."" ""but the rocks are full of the bones of extinct animals—mammoths and mastodons and enormous reptiles which lived here long before man was ever heard of."" ""have you ever seen those bones, winston? of course not. nineteenth-century biologists invented them. before man there was nothing. after man, if he could come to an end, there would be nothing. outside man there is nothing."" ""but the whole universe is outside us. look at the stars! some of them are a million light-years away. they are out of our reach forever."" ""what are the stars?"" said o'brien indifferently. ""they are bits of fire a few kilometers away. we could reach them if we wanted to. or we could blot them out. the earth is the center of the universe. the sun and the stars go round it."" winston made another convulsive movement. this time he did not say anything. o'brien continued as though answering a spoken objection: ""for certain purposes, of course, that is not true. when we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometers away. but what of it? do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? the stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? have you forgotten doublethink?"" winston shrank back upon the bed. whatever he said, the swift answer crushed him like a bludgeon. and yet he knew, he knew, that he was in the right. the belief that nothing exists outside your own mind—surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? had it not been exposed long ago as a fallacy? there was even a name for it, which he had forgotten. a faint smile twitched the corners of o'brien's mouth as he looked down at him. ""i told you, winston,"" he said, ""that metaphysics is not your strong point. the word you are trying to think of is solipsism. but you are mistaken. this is not solipsism. collective solipsism, if you like. but that is a different thing; in fact, the opposite thing. all this is a digression,"" he added in a different tone. ""the real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men."" he paused, and for a moment assumed again his air of a schoolmaster questioning a promising pupil: ""how does one man assert his power over another, winston?"" winston thought. ""by making him suffer,"" he said. ""exactly. by making him suffer. obedience is not enough. unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? it is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias that the old reformers imagined. a world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. progress in our world will be progress toward more pain. the old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. ours is founded upon hatred. in our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. everything else we shall destroy—everything. already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the revolution. we have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. but in the future there will be no wives and no friends. children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. the sex instinct will be eradicated. procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. we shall abolish the orgasm. our neurologists are at work upon it now. there will be no loyalty, except loyalty toward the party. there will be no love, except the love of big brother. there will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. there will be no art, no literature, no science. when we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. there will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. there will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. all competing pleasures will be destroyed. but always—do not forget this, winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. if you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever."" he paused as though he expected winston to speak. winston had tried to shrink back into the surface of the bed again. he could not say anything. his heart seemed to be frozen. o'brien went on: ""and remember that it is forever. the face will always be there to be stamped upon. the heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands—all that will continue, and worse. the espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the"
orwell,"executions, the disappearances will never cease. it will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. the more the party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant; the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. goldstein and his heresies will live forever. every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon—and yet they will always survive. this drama that i have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again, generation after generation, always in subtler forms. always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible—and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. that is the world that we are preparing, winston. a world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. you are beginning, i can see, to realize what that world will be like. but in the end you will do more than understand it. you will accept it, welcome it, become part of it."" winston had recovered himself sufficiently to speak. ""you can't!"" he said weakly. ""what do you mean by that remark, winston?"" ""you could not create such a world as you have just described. it is a dream. it is impossible."" ""why?"" ""it is impossible to found a civilization on fear and hatred and cruelty. it would never endure."" ""why not?"" ""it would have no vitality. it would disintegrate. it would commit suicide."" ""nonsense. you are under the impression that hatred is more exhausting than love. why should it be? and if it were, what difference would that make? suppose that we choose to wear ourselves out faster. suppose that we quicken the tempo of human life till men are senile at thirty. still what difference would it make? can you not understand that the death of the individual is not death? the party is immortal."" as usual, the voice had battered winston into helplessness. moreover he was in dread that if he persisted in his disagreement o'brien would twist the dial again. and yet he could not keep silent. feebly, without arguments, with nothing to support him except his inarticulate horror of what o'brien had said, he returned to the attack. ""i don't know—i don't care. somehow you will fail. something will defeat you. life will defeat you."" ""we control life, winston, at all its levels. you are imagining that there is something called human nature which will be outraged by what we do and will turn against us. but we create human nature. men are infinitely malleable. or perhaps you have returned to your old idea that the proletarians or the slaves will arise and overthrow us. put it out of your mind. they are helpless, like the animals. humanity is the party. the others are outside—irrelevant."" ""i don't care. in the end they will beat you. sooner or later they will see you for what you are, and then they will tear you to pieces."" ""do you see any evidence that that is happening? or any reason why it should?"" ""no. i believe it. i know that you will fail. there is something in the universe—i don't know, some spirit, some principle—that you will never overcome."" ""do you believe in god, winston?"" ""no."" ""then what is it, this principle that will defeat us?"" ""i don't know. the spirit of man."" ""and do you consider yourself a man?"" ""yes."" ""if you are a man, winston, you are the last man. your kind is extinct; we are the inheritors. do you understand that you are alone? you are outside history, you are nonexistent."" his manner changed and he said more harshly: ""and you consider yourself morally superior to us, with our lies and our cruelty?"" ""yes, i consider myself superior."" o'brien did not speak. two other voices were speaking. after a moment winston recognized one of them as his own. it was a sound track of the conversation he had had with o'brien, on the night when he had enrolled himself in the brotherhood. he heard himself promising to lie, to steal, to forge, to murder, to encourage drug taking and prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases, to throw vitriol in a child's face. o'brien made a small impatient gesture, as though to say that the demonstration was hardly worth making. then he turned a switch and the voices stopped. ""get up from that bed,"" he said. the bonds had loosened themselves. winston lowered himself to the floor and stood up unsteadily. ""you are the last man,"" said o'brien. ""you are the guardian of the human spirit. you shall see yourself as you are. take off your clothes."" winston undid the bit of string that held his overalls together. the zip fastener had long since been wrenched out of them. he could not remember whether at any time since his arrest he had taken off all his clothes at one time. beneath the overalls his body was looped with filthy yellowish rags, just recognizable as the remnants of underclothes. as he slid them to the ground he saw that there was a three-sided mirror at the far end of the room. he approached it, then stopped short. an involuntary cry had broken out of him. ""go on,"" said o'brien. ""stand between the wings of the mirror. you shall see the side view as well."" he had stopped because he was frightened. a bowed, gray-colored, skeletonlike thing was coming toward him. its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. he moved closer to the glass. the creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. a forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose and battered-looking cheekbones above which the eyes were fierce and watchful. the cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look."
orwell,"certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. the emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. he had gone partially bald. for the first moment he had thought that he had gone gray as well, but it was only the scalp that was gray. except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was gray all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. but the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body. the barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton; the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. he saw now what o'brien had meant about seeing the side view. the curvature of the spine was astonishing. the thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. at a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease. ""you have thought sometimes,"" said o'brien, ""that my face—the face of a member of the inner party—looks old and worn. what do you think of your own face?"" he seized winston's shoulder and spun him round so that he was facing him. ""look at the condition you are in!"" he said. ""look at this filthy grime all over your body. look at the dirt between your toes. look at that disgusting running sore on your leg. do you know that you stink like a goat? probably you have ceased to notice it. look at your emaciation. do you see? i can make my thumb and forefinger meet round your bicep. i could snap your neck like a carrot. do you know that you have lost twenty-five kilograms since you have been in our hands? even your hair is coming out in handfuls. look!"" he plucked at winston's head and brought away a tuft of hair. ""open your mouth. nine, ten, eleven teeth left. how many had you when you came to us? and the few you have left are dropping out of your head. look here!"" he seized one of winston's remaining front teeth between his powerful thumb and forefinger. a twinge of pain shot through winston's jaw. o'brien had wrenched the loose tooth out by the roots. he tossed it across the cell. ""you are rotting away,"" he said; ""you are falling to pieces. what are you? a bag of filth. now turn round and look into that mirror again. do you see that thing facing you? that is the last man. if you are human, that is humanity. now put your clothes on again."" winston began to dress himself with slow stiff movements. until now he had not seemed to notice how thin and weak he was. only one thought stirred in his mind: that he must have been in this place longer than he had imagined. then suddenly as he fixed the miserable rags round himself a feeling of pity for his ruined body overcame him. before he knew what he was doing he had collapsed onto a small stool that stood beside the bed and burst into tears. he was aware of his ugliness, his gracelessness, a bundle of bones in filthy underclothes sitting weeping in the harsh white light; but he could not stop himself. o'brien laid a hand on his shoulder, almost kindly. ""it will not last forever,"" he said. ""you can escape from it whenever you choose. everything depends on yourself."" ""you did it!"" sobbed winston. ""you reduced me to this state."" ""no, winston, you reduced yourself to it. this is what you accepted when you set yourself up against the party. it was all contained in that first act. nothing has happened that you did not foresee."" he paused, and then went on: ""we have beaten you, winston. we have broken you up. you have seen what your body is like. your mind is in the same state. i do not think there can be much pride left in you. you have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. you have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?"" winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. he looked up at o'brien. ""i have not betrayed julia,"" he said. o'brien looked down at him thoughtfully. ""no,"" he said, ""no; that is perfectly true. you have not betrayed julia."" the peculiar reverence for o'brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded winston's heart again. how intelligent, he thought, how intelligent! never did o'brien fail to understand what was said to him. anyone else on earth would have answered promptly that he had betrayed julia. for what was there that they had not screwed out of him under the torture? he had told them everything he knew about her, her habits, her character, her past life; he had confessed in the most trivial detail everything that had happened at their meetings, all that he had said to her and she to him, their black-market meals, their adulteries, their vague plottings against the party—everything. and yet, in the sense in which he intended the word, he had not betrayed her. he had not stopped loving her; his feeling toward her had remained the same. o'brien had seen what he meant without the need for explanation. ""tell me,"" he said, ""how soon will they shoot me?"" ""it might be a long time,"" said o'brien. ""you are a difficult case. but don't"
orwell,"give up hope. everyone is cured sooner or later. in the end we shall shoot you."" iv h e was much better. he was growing fatter and stronger every day, if it was proper to speak of days. the white light and the humming sound were the same as ever, but the cell was a little more comfortable than the others he had been in. there was a pillow and a mattress on the plank bed, and a stool to sit on. they had given him a bath, and they allowed him to wash himself fairly frequently in a tin basin. they even gave him warm water to wash with. they had given him new underclothes and a clean suit of overalls. they had dressed his varicose ulcer with soothing ointment. they had pulled out the remnants of his teeth and given him a new set of dentures. weeks or months must have passed. it would have been possible now to keep count of the passage of time, if he had felt any interest in doing so, since he was being fed at what appeared to be regular intervals. he was getting, he judged, three meals in the twenty-four hours; sometimes he wondered dimly whether he was getting them by night or by day. the food was surprisingly good, with meat at every third meal. once there was even a packet of cigarettes. he had no matches, but the never-speaking guard who brought his food would give him a light. the first time he tried to smoke it made him sick, but he persevered, and spun the packet out for a long time, smoking half a cigarette after each meal. they had given him a white slate with a stump of pencil tied to the corner. at first he made no use of it. even when he was awake he was completely torpid. often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. he had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. it seemed to make no difference, except that one's dreams were more coherent. he dreamed a great deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. he was in the golden country, or he was sitting among enormous, glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother, with julia, with o'brien—not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things. such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. he seemed to have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been removed. he was not bored; he had no desire for conversation or distraction. merely to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean all over, was completely satisfying. by degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. all he cared for was to lie quiet and feel the strength gathering in his body. he would finger himself here and there, trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing rounder and his skin tauter. finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees. after that, reluctantly at first, he began exercising himself regularly. in a little while he could walk three kilometers, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders were growing straighter. he attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished and humiliated to find what things he could not do. he could not move out of a walk, he could not hold his stool out at arm's length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over. he squatted down on his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift himself to a standing position. he lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his weight by his hands. it was hopeless; he could not raise himself a centimeter. but after a few more days—a few more mealtimes—even that feat was accomplished. a time came when he could do it six times running. he began to grow actually proud of his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back to normal. only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror. his mind grew more active. he sat down on the plank bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work deliberately at the task of re-educating himself. he had capitulated; that was agreed. in reality, as. he saw now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision. from the moment when he was inside the ministry of love—and yes, even during those minutes when he and julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the telescreen told them what to do—he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of his attempt to set himself up against the power of the party. he knew now that for seven years the thought police had watched him like a beede under a magnifying glass. there was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not noticed, no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. even the speck of whitish dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced. they had played sound tracks to him, shown him photographs. some of them were photographs of julia and himself. yes, even ... he could not fight against the party any longer. besides, the party was in the right. it must be so: how could the immortal, collective brain"
orwell,"be mistaken? by what external standard could you check its judgments? sanity was statistical. it was merely a question of learning to think as they thought. only—! the pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. he began to write down the thoughts that came into his head. he wrote first in large clumsy capitals: freedom is slavery then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it: two and two make five. but then there came a sort of check. his mind, as though shying away from something, seemed unable to concentrate. he knew that he knew what came next, but for the moment he could not recall it. when he did recall it, it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be; it did not come of its own accord. he wrote: god is power. he accepted everything. the past was alterable. the past never had been altered. oceania was at war with eastasia. oceania had always been at war with eastasia. jones, aaronson, and rutherford were guilty of the crimes they were charged with. he had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt. it had never existed; he had invented it. he remembered remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of self-deception. how easy it all was! only surrender, and everything else followed. it was like swimming against a current that swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn round and go with the current instead of opposing it. nothing had changed except your own attitude; the predestined thing happened in any case. he hardly knew why he had ever rebelled. everything was easy, except—! anything could be true. the so-called laws of nature were nonsense. the law of gravity was nonsense. ""if i wished,"" o'brien had said, ""i could float off this floor like a soap bubble."" winston worked it out. ""if he thinks he floats off the floor, and if i simultaneously think i see him do it, then the thing happens."" suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: ""it doesn't really happen. we imagine it. it is hallucination."" he pushed the thought under instantly. the fallacy was obvious. it presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a ""real"" world where ""real"" things happened. but how could there be such a world? what knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? all happenings are in the mind. whatever happens in all minds, truly happens. he had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and he was in no danger of succumbing to it. he realized, nevertheless, that it ought never to have occurred to him. the mind should develop a blind spot whenever a dangerous thought presented itself. the process should be automatic, instinctive. crimestop, they called it in newspeak. he set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. he presented himself with propositions—""the party says the earth is flat,"" ""the party says that ice is heavier than water""—and trained himself in not seeing or not understanding the arguments that contradicted them. it was not easy. it needed great powers of reasoning and improvisation. the arithmetical problems raised, for instance, by such a statement as ""two and two make five"" were beyond his intellectual grasp. it needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical errors. stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain. all the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered how soon they would shoot him. ""everything depends on yourself,"" o'brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring it nearer. it might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. they might keep him for years in solitary confinement; they might send him to a labor camp; they might release him for a while, as they sometimes did. it was perfectly possible that before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted all over again. the one certain thing was that death never came at an expected moment. the tradition—the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you never heard it said—was that they shot you from behind, always in the back of the head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell. one day—but ""one day"" was not the right expression; just as probably it was in the middle of the night: once—he fell into a strange, blissful reverie. he was walking down the corridor, waiting for the bullet. he knew that it was coming in another moment. everything was settled, smoothed out, reconciled. there were no more doubts, no more arguments, no more pain, no more fear. his body was healthy and strong. he walked easily, with a joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. he was not any longer in the narrow white corridors of the ministry of love; he was in the enormous sunlit passage, a kilometer wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced by drugs. he was in the golden country, following the foot-track across the old rabbit-cropped pasture. he could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the gentle sunshine on his face. at the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green pools under the willows. suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. the sweat broke out on his backbone. he had heard himself cry aloud: ""julia! julia! julia, my love! julia!"" for a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination of her presence. she had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. it was as though she had got into the texture"
orwell,"of his skin. in that moment he had loved her far more than he had ever done when they were together and free. also he knew that somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help. he lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself. what had he done? how many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of weakness? in another moment he would hear the tramp of boots outside. they could not let such an outburst go unpunished. they would know now, if they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them. he obeyed the party, but he still hated the party. in the old days he had hidden a heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. now he had retreated a step further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart inviolate. he knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred to be in the wrong. they would understand that—o'brien would understand it. it was all confessed in that single foolish cry. he would have to start all over again. it might take years. he ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new shape. there were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose flattened. besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a complete new set of teeth. it was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did not know what your face looked like. in any case, mere control of the features was not enough. for the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself. you must know all the while that it is there, but until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape that could be given a name. from now onwards he must not only think right; he must feel right, dream right. and all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the rest of him, a kind of cyst. one day they would decide to shoot him. you could not tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to guess. it was always from behind, walking down a corridor. ten seconds would be enough. in that time the world inside him could turn over. and then suddenly, without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a line in his face—suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang! would go the batteries of his hatred. hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. and almost in the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. they would have blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. the heretical thought would be unpunished, unrepented, out of their reach forever. they would have blown a hole in their own perfection. to die hating them, that was freedom. he shut his eyes. it was more difficult than accepting an intellectual discipline. it was a question of degrading himself, mutilating himself. he had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. what was the most horrible, sickening thing of all? he thought of big brother. the enormous face (because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a meter wide), with its heavy black mustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro, seemed to float into his mind of its own accord. what were his true feelings toward big brother? there was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. the steel door swung open with a clang. o'brien walked into the cell. behind him were the waxen-faced officer and the black-uniformed guards. ""get up,"" said o'brien. ""come here."" winston stood opposite him. o'brien took winston's shoulders between his strong hands and looked at him closely. ""you have had thoughts of deceiving me,"" he said. ""that was stupid. stand up straighter. look me in the face."" he paused, and went on in a gender tone: ""you are improving. intellectually there is very little wrong with you. it is only emotionally that you have failed to make progress. tell me, winston—and remember, no lies; you know that i am always able to detect a lie—tell me, what are your true feelings toward big brother?"" ""i hate him."" ""you hate him. good. then the time has come for you to take the last step. you must love big brother. it is not enough to obey him; you must love him."" he released winston with a little push toward the guards. ""room ,"" he said. v a t each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or seemed to know, whereabouts he was in the windowless building. possibly there were slight differences in the air pressure. the cells where the guards had beaten him were below ground level. the room where he had been interrogated by o'brien was high up near the roof. this place was many meters underground, as deep down as it was possible to go. it was bigger than most of the cells he had been in. but he hardly noticed his surroundings. all he noticed was that there were two small tables straight in front of him, each covered with green baize. one was only a meter or two from him; the other was further away, near the door. he was strapped upright in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. a sort of pad gripped his head from behind, forcing him to look straight in front of him. for a moment he was alone, then the door opened and o'brien came in. ""you asked me once,"" said o'brien, ""what was in"
orwell,"room . i told you that you knew the answer already. everyone knows it. the thing that is in room is the worst thing in the world."" the door opened again. a guard came in, carrying something made of wire, a box or basket of some kind. he set it down on the further table. because of the position in which o'brien was standing, winston could not see what the thing was. ""the worst thing in the world,"" said o'brien, ""varies from individual to individual. it may be burial alive, or death by fire, or by drowning, or by impalement, or fifty other deaths. there are cases where it is some quite trivial thing, not even fatal."" he had moved a little to one side, so that winston had a better view of the thing on the table. it was an oblong wire cage with a handle on top for carrying it by. fixed to the front of it was something that looked like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. although it was three or four meters away from him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each. they were rats. ""in your case,"" said o'brien, ""the worst thing in the world happens to be rats."" a sort of premonitory tremor, a fear of he was not certain what, had passed through winston as soon as he caught his first glimpse of the cage. but at this moment the meaning of the mask-like attachment in front of it suddenly sank into him. his bowels seemed to turn to water. ""you can't do that!"" he cried out in a high cracked voice. ""you couldn't, you couldn't! it's impossible."" ""do you remember,"" said o'brien, ""the moment of panic that used to occur in your dreams? there was a wall of blackness in front of you, and a roaring sound in your ears. there was something terrible on the other side of the wall. you knew that you knew what it was, but you dared not drag it into the open. it was the rats that were on the other side of the wall."" ""o'brien!"" said winston, making an effort to control his voice. ""you know this is not necessary. what is it that you want me to do?"" o'brien made no direct answer. when he spoke it was in the schoolmasterish manner that he sometimes affected. he looked thoughtfully into the distance, as though he were addressing an audience somewhere behind winston's back. ""by itself,"" he said, ""pain is not always enough. there are occasions when a human being will stand out against pain, even to the point of death. but for everyone there is something unendurable—something that cannot be contemplated. courage and cowardice are not involved. if you are falling from a height it is not cowardly to clutch at a rope. if you have come up from deep water it is not cowardly to fill your lungs with air. it is merely an instinct which cannot be disobeyed. it is the same with the rats. for you, they are unendurable. they are a form of pressure that you cannot withstand, even if you wished to. you will do what is required of you."" ""but what is it, what is it? how can i do it if i don't know what it is?"" o'brien picked up the cage and brought it across to the nearer table. he set it down carefully on the baize cloth. winston could hear the blood singing in his ears. he had the feeling of sitting in utter loneliness. he was in the middle of a great empty plain, a flat desert drenched with sunlight, across which all sounds came to him out of immense distances. yet the cage with the rats was not two meters away from him. they were enormous rats. they were at the age when a rat's muzzle grows blunt and fierce and his fur brown instead of gray. ""the rat,"" said o'brien, still addressing his invisible audience, ""although a rodent, is carnivorous. you are aware of that. you will have heard of the things that happen in the poor quarters of this town. in some streets a woman dare not leave her baby alone in the house, even for five minutes. the rats are certain to attack it. within quite a small time they will strip it to the bones. they also attack sick or dying people. they show astonishing intelligence in knowing when a human being is helpless."" there was an outburst of squeals from the cage. it seemed to reach winston from far away. the rats were fighting; they were trying to get at each other through the partition. he heard also a deep groan of despair. that, too, seemed to come from outside himself. o'brien picked up the cage, and, as he did so, pressed something in it. there was a sharp click. winston made a frantic effort to tear himself loose from the chair. it was hopeless: every part of him, even his head, was held immovably. o'brien moved the cage nearer. it was less than a meter from winston's face. ""i have pressed the first lever,"" said o'brien. ""you understand the construction of this cage. the mask will fit over your head, leaving no exit. when i press this other lever, the door of the cage will slide up. these starving brutes will shoot out of it like bullets. have you ever seen a rat leap through the air? they will leap onto your face and bore straight into it. sometimes they attack the eyes first. sometimes they burrow through the cheeks and devour the tongue."" the cage was nearer; it was closing in. winston heard a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his head. but he fought furiously against his panic. to think, to think, even with a split second left—to think was"
orwell,"the only hope. suddenly the foul musty odor of the brutes struck his nostrils. there was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and he almost lost consciousness. everything had gone black. for an instant he was insane, a screaming animal. yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea. there was one and only one way to save himself. he must interpose another human being, the body of another human being, between himself and the rats. the circle of the mask was large enough now to shut out the vision of anything else. the wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his face. the rats knew what was coming now. one of them was leaping up and down; the other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against the bars, and fiercely snuffed the air. winston could see the whiskers and the yellow teeth. again the black panic took hold of him. he was blind, helpless, mindless. ""it was a common punishment in imperial china,"" said o'brien as didactically as ever. the mask was closing on his face. the wire brushed his cheek. and then—no, it was not relief, only hope, a tiny fragment of hope. too late, perhaps too late. but he had suddenly understood that in the whole world there was just one person to whom he could transfer his punishment— one body that he could thrust between himself and the rats. and he was shouting frantically, over and over. ""do it to julia! do it to julia! not me! julia! i don't care what you do to her. tear her face off, strip her to the bones. not me! julia! not me!"" he was falling backwards, into enormous depths, away from the rats. he was still strapped in the chair, but he had fallen through the floor, through the walls of the building, through the earth, through the oceans, through the atmosphere, into outer space, into the gulfs between the stars—always away, away, away from the rats. he was light-years distant, but o'brien was still standing at his side. there was still the cold touch of wire against his cheek. but through the darkness that enveloped him he heard another metallic click, and knew that the cage door had clicked shut and not open. vi t he c hestnut t ree was almost empty. a ray of sunlight slanting through a window fell yellow on dusty tabletops. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. a tinny music trickled from the telescreens. winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty glass. now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite wall. big brother is watching you , the caption said. unbidden, a waiter came and filled his glass up with victory gin, shaking into it a few drops from another bottle with a quill through the cork. it was saccharine flavored with cloves, the speciality of the café. winston was listening to the telescreen. at present only music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment there might be a special bulletin from the ministry of peace. the news from the african front was disquieting in the extreme. on and off he had been worrying about it all day. a eurasian army (oceania was at war with eurasia; oceania had always been at war with eurasia) was moving southward at terrifying speed. the midday bulletin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probable that already the mouth of the congo was a battlefield. brazzaville and leopoldville were in danger. one did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. it was not merely a question of losing central africa; for the first time in the whole war, the territory of oceania itself was menaced. a violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of undifferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. he stopped thinking about the war. in these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more than a few moments at a time. he picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp. as always, it made him shudder and even retch slightly. the stuff was horrible. the cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with the smell of those—— he never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far as it was possible he never visualized them. they were something that he was half aware of, hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. as the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. he had grown fatter since they released him, and had regained his old color—indeed, more than regained it. his features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the bald scalp was too deep a pink. a waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and the current issue of the times, with the page turned down at the chess problem. then, seeing that winston's glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. there was no need to give orders. they knew his habits. the chessboard was always waiting for him, his corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full he had it to himself, since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. he never even bothered to count his drinks. at irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of paper which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always undercharged him. it would have made no difference if it had been the other way about. he had always plenty of money nowadays. he"
orwell,"even had a job, a sinecure, more highly paid than his old job had been. the music from the telescreen stopped and a voice took over. winston raised his head to listen. no bulletin from the front, however. it was merely a brief announcement from the ministry of plenty. in the preceding quarter, it appeared, the tenth three-year plan's quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by ninety-eight per cent. he examined the chess problem and set out the pieces. it was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights. ""white to play and mate in two moves."" winston looked up at the portrait of big brother. white always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. always, without exception, it is so arranged. in no chess problem since the beginning of the world has black ever won. did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of good over evil? the huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. white always mates. the voice from the telescreen paused and added in a different and much graver tone: ""you are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty. fifteen-thirty! this is news of the highest importance. take care not to miss it. fifteen-thirty!"" the tinkling music struck up again. winston's heart stirred. that was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it was bad news that was coming. all day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought of a smashing defeat in africa had been in and out of his mind. he seemed actually to see the eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down into the tip of africa like a column of ants. why had it not been possible to outflank them in some way? the outline of the west african coast stood out vividly in his mind. he picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. there was the proper spot. even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their comunications by land and sea. he felt that by willing it he was bringing that other force into existence. but it was necessary to act quickly. if they could get control of the whole of africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the cape, it would cut oceania in two. it might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision of the world, the destruction of the party! he drew a deep breath. an extraordinary medley of feelings—but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was undermost—struggled inside him. the spasm passed. he put the white knight back in its place, but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess problem. his thoughts wandered again. almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table: + = . ""they can't get inside you,"" she had said. but they could get inside you. ""what happens to you here is forever ;"" o'brien had said. that was a true word. there were things, your own acts, from which you could not recover. something was killed in your breast; burnt out, cauterized out. he had seen her; he had even spoken to her. there was no danger in it. he knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no interest in his doings. he could have arranged to meet her a second time if either of them had wanted to. actually it was by chance that they had met. it was in the park, on a vile, biting day in march, when the earth was like iron and all the grass seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. he was hurrying along with frozen hands and watering eyes when he saw her not ten meters away from him. it struck him at once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. they almost passed one another without a sign; then he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. he knew that there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in them. she did not speak. she walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. presently they were in among a clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection from the wind. they halted. it was vilely cold. the wind whistled through the twigs and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. he put his arm round her waist. there was no telescreen, but there must be hidden microphones; besides, they could be seen. it did not matter, nothing mattered. they could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to. his flesh froze with horror at the thought of it. she made no response whatever to the clasp of his arm; she did not even try to disengage herself. he knew now what had changed in her. her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair, across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. it was that her waist had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. he remembered how once, after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone than flesh. her body felt like that. it occurred to him that the texture of her skin would be quite different from what it had once been. he did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak. as they walked back across"
orwell,"the grass she looked directly at him for the first time. it was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. he wondered whether it was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. they sat down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. he saw that she was about to speak. she moved her clumsy shoe a few centimeters and deliberately crushed a twig. her feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed. ""i betrayed you,"" she said baldly. ""i betrayed you,"" he said. she gave him another quick look of dislike. ""sometimes,"" she said, ""they threaten you with something—something you can't stand up to, can't even think about. and then you say, 'don't do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to so-and-so.' and perhaps you might pretend, afterwards, that it was only a trick and that you just said it to make them stop and didn't really mean it. but that isn't true. at the time when it happens you do mean it. you think there's no other way of saving yourself, and you're quite ready to save yourself that way. you want it to happen to the other person. you don't give a damn what they suffer. all you care about is yourself."" ""all you care about is yourself,"" he echoed. ""and after that, you don't feel the same toward the other person any longer."" ""no,"" he said, ""you don't feel the same."" there did not seem to be anything more to say. the wind plastered their thin overalls against their bodies. almost at once it became embarrassing to sit there in silence; besides, it was too cold to keep still. she said something about catching her tube and stood up to go. ""we must meet again,"" he said. ""yes,"" she said, ""we must meet again."" he followed irresolutely for a little distance, half a pace behind her. they did not speak again. she did not actually try to shake him off, but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. he had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the tube station, but suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable. he was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from julia as to get back to the chestnut tree café, which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment. he had a nostalgic vision of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard and the ever-flowing gin. above all, it would be warm in there. the next moment, not altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small knot of people. he made a half-hearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, turned and made off in the opposite direction. when he had gone fifty meters he looked back. the street was not crowded, but already he could not distinguish her. any one of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers. perhaps her thickened, stiffened body was no longer recognizable from behind. ""at the time when it happens,"" she had said, ""you do mean it."" he had meant it. he had not merely said it, he had wished it. he had wished that she and not he should be delivered over to the—— something changed in the music that trickled from the telescreen. a cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. and then—perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance of sound—a voice was singing: "" under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me— "" the tears welled up in his eyes. a passing waiter noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle. he took up his glass and sniffed at it. the stuff grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. but it had become the element he swam in. it was his life, his death, and his resurrection. it was gin that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. when he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a back that seemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even to rise from the horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed overnight. through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy, listening to the telescreen. from fifteen to closing time he was a fixture in the chestnut tree. no one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no telescreen admonished him. occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty, forgotten-looking office in the ministry of truth and did a little work, or what was called work. he had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that arose in the compilation of the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary. they were engaged in producing something called an interim report, but what it was that they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. it was something to do with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside. there were four others on the committee, all of them persons similar to himself. there were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. but there were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were never finished—when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing"
orwell,"about grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions, enormous digressions, quarrels—threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. and then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow. the telescreen was silent for a moment. winston raised his head again. the bulletin! but no, they were merely changing the music. he had the map of africa behind his eyelids. the movement of the armies was a diagram: a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow tearing horizontally eastward, across the tail of the first. as though for reassurance he looked up at the imperturbable face in the portrait. was it conceivable that the second arrow did not even exist? his interest flagged again. he drank another mouthful of gin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. check. but it was evidently not the right move, because— uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. he saw a candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice box, and laughing excitedly. his mother was sitting opposite him and also laughing. it must have been about a month before she disappeared. it was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. he remembered the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the window pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. the boredom of the two children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. winston whined and grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room, pulling everything out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbors banged on the wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently. in the end his mother said, ""now be good, and i'll buy you a toy. a lovely toy—you'll love it""; and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open near by, and come back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders. he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. it was a miserable outfit. the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides. winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest. but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play. soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddlywinks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost back to the starting point. they played eight games, winning four each. his tiny sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing. for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood. he pushed the picture out of his mind. it was a false memory. he was troubled by false memories occasionally. they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were. some things had happened, others had not happened. he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again. almost in the same instant it dropped onto the board with a clatter. he had started as though a pin had run into him. a shrill trumpet call had pierced the air. it was the bulletin! victory! it always meant victory when a trumpet call preceded the news. a sort of electric thrill ran through the café. even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears. the trumpet call had let loose an enormous volume of noise. already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. the news had run round the streets like magic. he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened as he had foreseen: a vast seaborne armada secretly assembled, a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black. fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: ""vast strategic maneuver—perfect co-ordination—utter rout—half a million prisoners—complete demoralization—control of the whole of africa—bring the war within measurable distance of its end—victory—greatest victory in human history—victory, victory, victory!"" under the table winston's feet made convulsive movements. he had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. he looked up again at the portrait of big brother. the colossus that bestrode the world! the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain! he thought how ten minutes ago—yes, only ten minutes—there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. ah, it was more than a eurasian army that had perished! much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment. the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little. the waiters were turning back to their work. one of them approached with the gin bottle. winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. he was not running or cheering any longer. he was back in the ministry of love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. he was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. he was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at"
orwell,"his back. the long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain. he gazed up at the enormous face. forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark mustache. o cruel, needless misunderstanding! o stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. but it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. he had won the victory over himself. he loved big brother. the end appendix the principles of newspeak n ewspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc, or english socialism. in the year there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication, either in speech or writing. the leading articles in the times were written in it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist. it was expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak (or standard english, as we should call it) by about the year . meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all party members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech. the version in use in , and embodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later. it is with the final, perfected version, as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary, that we are concerned here. the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought—that is, a thought diverging from the principles of ingsoc—should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods. this was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. to give a single example. the word free still existed in newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as ""this dog is free from lice"" or ""this field is free from weeds."" it could not be used in its old sense of ""politically free"" or ""intellectually free"" since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive. newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum. newspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it, though many newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly created words, would be barely intelligible to an english-speaker of our own day. newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the a vocabulary, the b vocabulary (also called compound words), and the c vocabulary. it will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories. the a. vocabulary. the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life—for such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like. it was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess—words like hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field —but in comparison with the present-day english vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly defined. all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them. so far as it could be achieved, a newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept. it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion. it was intended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions. the grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. the first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech. any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when ) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb. between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms. the word thought, for example, did not exist in newspeak. its place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb. no etymological principle was followed here; in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed. there was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife. adjectives were formed by adding the suffix - ful to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding - wise. thus, for example, speedful meant ""rapid"" and speedwise meant ""quickly."" certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft, were retained,"
orwell,"but their total number was very small. there was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding - ful to a noun-verb. none of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a very few already ending in -wise; the - wise termination was invariable. the word well, for example, was replaced by goodwise. in addition, any word—this again applied in principle to every word in the language—could be negatived by adding the affix un -, or could be strengthened by the affix plus-, or, for still greater emphasis, doubleplus-. thus, for example, uncold meant ""warm,"" while pluscold and doublepluscold meant, respectively, ""very cold"" and ""superlatively cold."" it was also possible, as in present-day english, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc. by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. given, for instance, the word good, there was no need for such a word as bad, since the required meaning was equally well—indeed, better—expressed by ungood. all that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of them to suppress. dark, for example, could be replaced by unlight, or light by undark, according to preference. the second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity. subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below, all inflections followed the same rules. thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in -ed. the preterite of steal was stealed, the preterite of think was thinked, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as swam, gave, brought, spoke, taken, etc., being abolished. all plurals were made by adding -s or -es as the case might be. the plurals of man, ox, life, were mans, oxes, lifes. comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding -er, -est ( good, gooder, goodest ), irregular forms and the more, most formation being suppressed. the only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs. all of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the shall, should tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by will and would. there were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. a word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. but this need made itself felt chiefly in connection with the b vocabulary. why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay. the b vocabulary. the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak, or even into words taken from the a vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones. the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language. the b words were in all cases compound words. * they consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. the resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. to take a single example: the word goodthink, meaning, very roughly, ""orthodoxy,"" or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, ""to think in an orthodox manner."" this inflected as follows: noun-verb, goodthink; past tense and past participle, goodthinked; present participle, goodthinking adjective, goodthinkful; adverb, goodthinkwise; verbal noun, goodthinker. the b words were not constructed on any etymological plan. the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation. in the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for instance, the think came second, whereas in thinkpol (thought police) it came first, and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable. because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary. for example, the adjective forms of minitrue, minipax, and miniluv were, respectively, minitruthful, minipeaceful, and minilovely, simply because -trueful, -paxful, and -loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce. in principle, however, all b words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way. some of the b words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole. consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a times leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc. the shortest rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be: ""those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of english socialism."" but this is not an adequate translation. to begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc. and in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word oldthink, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence."
orwell,"but the special function of certain newspeak words, of which oldthink was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them. these words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten. the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they canceled by their existence. as we have already seen in the case of the word free, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. countless other words such as honor, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science, and religion had simply ceased to exist. a few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them. all words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word crimethink, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink. greater precision would have been dangerous. what was required in a party member was an outiook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshiped ""false gods."" he did not need to know that these gods were called baal, osiris, moloch, ashtaroth, and the like; probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy. he knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah; he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods. in somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible. his sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime (sexual immorality) and good-sex (chastity). sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. it covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practiced for its own sake. there was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. in the c vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them. he knew what was meant by goodsex —that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman; all else was sexcrime. in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical; beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent. no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral. a great many were euphemisms. such words, for instance, as joycamp (forced-labor camp) or minipax (ministry of peace, i.e., ministry of war) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society. an example was prolefeed, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses. other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation ""good"" when applied to the party and ""bad"" when applied to its enemies. but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological color not from their meaning, but from their structure. so far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary. the name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. in the ministry of truth, for example, the records department, in which winston smith worked, was called recdep, the fiction department was called ficdep, the teleprograms department was called teledep, and so on. this was not done solely with the object of saving time. even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. examples were such words as nazi, gestapo, comintern, inprecorr, agitprop. in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it. the words communist international, for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, karl marx, and the paris commune. the word comintern, on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine. it refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily. in the same way, the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth. this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable. in newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning. regularity"
orwell,"of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. and rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, were short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind. the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. almost invariably these words— goodthink, minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joy camp, ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless others—were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. and this was exactly what was aimed at. the intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness. for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgment should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. his training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain willful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc, assisted the process still further. so did the fact of having very few words to choose from. relative to our own, the newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised. newspeak, indeed, differed from almost all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year. each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought. ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centers at all. this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak, meaning ""to quack like a duck."" like various other words in the b vocabulary, duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning. provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when the times referred to one of the orators of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment. the c vocabulary. the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. these resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings. they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists. only a very few words were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. there was, indeed, no word for ""science,"" any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc. *** f rom the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible. it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy. it would have been possible, for example, to say big brother is ungood. but this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available. ideas inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so. one could, in fact, only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak. for example, all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence. it did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth, i.e., that all men are of equal size, weight, or strength. the concept of political equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal. in , when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings. in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished. a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of ""politically equal,"" or that free had once meant ""intellectually free,"" than, for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook. there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of newspeak would become more and more pronounced—its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing. when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed. history had already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature"

moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. how often, or on what system, the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. you had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. it was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. a kilometer away the ministry of truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. this, he thought with a sort of vague distaste—this was london, chief city of airstrip one, itself the third most populous of the provinces of oceania. he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this. were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with balks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken"
orwell,"houses? but it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible. the ministry of truth—minitrue, in newspeak * —was startlingly different from any other object in sight. it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, three hundred meters into the air. from where winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the party: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. the ministry of truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided: the ministry of truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts; the ministry of peace, which concerned itself with war; the ministry of love, which maintained law and order; and the ministry of plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. their names, in newspeak: minitrue, minipax, miniluv, and miniplenty. the ministry of love was the really frightening one. there were no windows in it at all. winston had never been inside the ministry of love, nor within half a kilometer of it. it was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons. winston turned round abruptly. he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-colored bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow’s breakfast. he took down from the shelf a bottle of colorless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin . it gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of chinese rice-spirit. winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine. instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. the stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. the next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out onto the floor. with the next he was more successful. he went back to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. from the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. for some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an unusual position. instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. by sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. he could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. it was a peculiarly beautiful book. its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. he could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (“dealing on the free market,” it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. he had carried it guiltily home in his brief case. even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession. the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. this was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labor camp. winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. the pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and"
orwell,"he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink pencil. actually he was not used to writing by hand. apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speakwrite which was of course impossible for his present purpose. he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. a tremor had gone through his bowels. to mark the paper was the decisive act. in small clumsy letters he wrote: april th, . he sat back. a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. to begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was . it must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in or ; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. for whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? for the future, for the unborn. his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink. for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. how could you communicate with the future? it was of its nature impossible. either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless. for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. the telescreen had changed over to strident military music. it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. the actual writing would be easy. all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. at this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. he dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. the seconds were ticking by. he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin. suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: april th, . last night to the flicks. all warfilms. one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean. audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him. first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water. audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middleaged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself. all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful shot of a childs arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never— winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. it was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today. it had happened that morning at the ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen. it was nearly eleven hundred, and in the records department, where winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the center of the hall, opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the two minutes hate. winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. one of them was a"
orwell,"girl whom he often passed in the corridors. he did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the fiction department. presumably—since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner—she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. she was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick dark hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. a narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the junior anti-sex league, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. he knew the reason. it was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. he disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. it was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. once when they passed in the corridor she had given him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police. that, it was true, was very unlikely. still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him. the other person was a man named o’brien, a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature. a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching. o’brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming—in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. it was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. winston had seen o’brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. he felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o’brien’s urbane manner and his prizefighter’s physique. much more it was because of a secretly held belief—or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope—that o’brien’s political orthodoxy was not perfect. something in his face suggested it irresistibly. and again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to, if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess; indeed, there was no way of doing so. at this moment o’brien glanced at his wristwatch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over. he took a chair in the same row as winston, a couple of places away. a small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them. the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind. the next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. it was a noise that set one’s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s neck. the hate had started. as usual, the face of emmanuel goldstein, the enemy of the people, had flashed onto the screen. there were hisses here and there among the audience. the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the party, almost on a level with big brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. the program of the two minutes hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure. he was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the party’s purity. all subsequent crimes against the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters; perhaps even—so it was occasionally rumored—in some hiding place in oceania itself. winston’s diaphragm was constricted. he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. it was a lean jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard—a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. it resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheeplike quality. goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the party—an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. he was abusing big brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia, he was advocating freedom of"
orwell,"speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed—and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party, and even contained newspeak words: more newspeak words, indeed, than any party member would normally use in real life. and all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldstein’s specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army—row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers’ boots formed the background to goldstein’s bleating voice. before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. the self-satisfied sheeplike face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne; besides, the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia, since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other. but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day, and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were—in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police. he was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state. the brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. there were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. it was a book without a title. people referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. but one knew of such things only through vague rumors. neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy. people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. the little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. even o’brien’s heavy face was flushed. he was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. the dark-haired girl behind winston had begun crying out “swine! swine! swine!” and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. it struck goldstein’s nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. within thirty seconds any pretense was always unnecessary. a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. thus, at one moment winston’s hatred was not turned against goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against big brother, the party, and the thought police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true. at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into adoration, and big brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of asia, and goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. it was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one’s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him. vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. he would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian. he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. he hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with"
orwell,"your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity. the hate rose to its climax. the voice of goldstein had become an actual sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his submachine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. but in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother, black-haired, black mustachio’d, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. nobody heard what big brother was saying. it was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. then the face of big brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone’s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. the little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. with a tremulous murmur that sounded like “my savior!” she extended her arms toward the screen. then she buried her face in her hands. it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer. at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of “b-b! . . . b-b! . . . b-b!” over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first “b” and the second—a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise. winston’s entrails seemed to grow cold. in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this subhuman chanting of “b-b! . . . b-b!” always filled him with horror. of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. to dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression in his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him. and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened—if, indeed, it did happen. momentarily he caught o’brien’s eye. o’brien had stood up. he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen winston knew—yes, he knew! —that o’brien was thinking the same thing as himself. an unmistakable message had passed. it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. “i am with you,” o’brien seemed to be saying to him. “i know precisely what you are feeling. i know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. but don’t worry, i am on your side!” and then the flash of intelligence was gone, and o’brien’s face was as inscrutable as everybody else’s. that was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. such incidents never had any sequel. all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the party. perhaps the rumors of vast underground conspiracies were true after all—perhaps the brotherhood really existed! it was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth. some days he believed in it, some days not. there was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hands which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. it was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at o’brien again. the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. it would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. for a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. but even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live. winston roused himself and sat up straighter. he let out a belch. the gin was rising from his stomach. his eyes refocused on the page. he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action. and it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. his pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals— down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again, filling half a page. he could not help feeling a twinge of panic. it was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was"
orwell,"not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary; but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether. he did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. whether he wrote down with big brother, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference. whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. the thought police would get him just the same. he had committed—would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itself. thoughtcrime, they called it. thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. you might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you. it was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night. the sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. in the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. people simply disappeared, always during the night. your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten. you were abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word. for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: theyll shoot me i dont care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother— he sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. the next moment he started violently. there was a knocking at the door. already! he sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt. but no, the knocking was repeated. the worst thing of all would be to delay. his heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. he got up and moved heavily toward the door. oceanofpdf.com ii a s he put his hand to the doorknob winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table. down with big brother was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done. but, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet. he drew in his breath and opened the door. instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. a colorless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside. “oh, comrade,” she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, “i thought i heard you come in. do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? it’s got blocked up and—” it was mrs. parsons, the wife of a neighbor on the same floor. (“mrs.” was a word somewhat discountenanced by the party—you were supposed to call everyone “comrade”—but with some women one used it instinctively.) she was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. winston followed her down the passage. these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation. victory mansions were old flats, built in or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy. repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window pane for two years. “of course it’s only because tom isn’t home,” said mrs. parsons vaguely. the parsons’s flat was bigger than winston’s, and dingy in a different way. everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. games impedimenta—hockey sticks, boxing gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out—lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise books. on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies, and a full-sized poster of big brother. there was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which—one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how—was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen. “it’s the children,” said mrs. parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door. “they haven’t been out today. and of course—” she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe. he hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing. mrs. parsons looked on helplessly. “of course if tom was home he’d put it right in a moment,” she said. “he loves anything like that. he’s ever so good with his hands, tom is.” parsons was winston’s fellow employee at the ministry of truth. he was a fattish but active"
orwell,"man of paralyzing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms—one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the party depended. at thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the youth league, and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age. at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. he would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the community center every evening for the past four years. an overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone. “have you got a spanner?” said winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint. “a spanner,” said mrs. parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. “i don’t know, i’m sure. perhaps the children—” there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living room. mrs. parsons brought the spanner. winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. he cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room. “up with your hands!” yelled a savage voice. a handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, gray shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies. winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy’s demeanor, that it was not altogether a game. “you’re a traitor!” yelled the boy. “you’re a thought-criminal! you’re a eurasian spy! i’ll shoot you, i’ll vaporize you, i’ll send you to the salt mines!” suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting “traitor!” and “thought-criminal!”, the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. it was somehow slightly frightening, like the gamboling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. there was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy’s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, winston thought. mrs. parsons’s eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children, and back again. in the better light of the living room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face. “they do get so noisy,” she said. “they’re disappointed because they couldn’t go to see the hanging, that’s what it is. i’m too busy to take them and tom won’t be back from work in time.” “why can’t we go and see the hanging?” roared the boy in his huge voice. “want to see the hanging! want to see the hanging!” chanted the little girl, still capering round. some eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the park that evening, winston remembered. this happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. children always clamored to be taken to see it. he took his leave of mrs. parsons and made for the door. but he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow. it was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. he spun round just in time to see mrs. parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult. “goldstein!” bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. but what most struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman’s grayish face. back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. the music from the telescreen had stopped. instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new floating fortress which had just been anchored between iceland and the faroe islands. with those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. nearly all children nowadays were horrible. what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the party. on the contrary, they adored the party and everything connected with it. the songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of big brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them. all their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the state, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. it was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. and with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which the times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak—“child hero” was the phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising remark and denounced his parents to the thought police. the sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. he picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. suddenly he began thinking"
orwell,"of o’brien again. years ago—how long was it? seven years it must be—he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. and someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: “we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.” it was said very quietly, almost casually—a statement, not a command. he had walked on without pausing. what was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. it was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. he could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen o’brien for the first time; nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as o’brien’s. but at any rate the identification existed. it was o’brien who had spoken to him out of the dark. winston had never been able to feel sure—even after this morning’s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure—whether o’brien was a friend or an enemy. nor did it even seem to matter greatly. there was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship. “we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,” he had said. winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come true. the voice from the telescreen paused. a trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. the voice continued raspingly: “attention! your attention, please! a newsflash has this moment arrived from the malabar front. our forces in south india have won a glorious victory. i am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end. here is the newsflash—” bad news coming, thought winston. and sure enough, following on a gory description of the annihilation of a eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grams to twenty. winston belched again. the gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. the telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into “oceania, ’tis for thee.” you were supposed to stand to attention. however, in his present position he was invisible. “oceania, ’tis for thee” gave way to lighter music. winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. the day was still cold and clear. somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present. down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word ingsoc fitfully appeared and vanished. ingsoc. the sacred principles of ingsoc. newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster. he was alone. the past was dead, the future was unimaginable. what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure forever? like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. he took a twenty-five-cent piece out of his pocket. there, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother. even from the coin the eyes pursued you. on coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere. always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed—no escape. nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters inside your skull. the sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the ministry of truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. his heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. it was too strong, it could not be stormed. a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. for the future, for the past—for an age that might be imaginary. and in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapor. only the thought police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive? the telescreen struck fourteen. he must leave in ten minutes. he had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty. curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. he was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. but so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. he went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote: to the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone—to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: from the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of big brother, from the age of doublethink—greetings! he was already dead, he reflected. it seemed to him that it was only now,"
orwell,"when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. the consequences of every act are included in the act itself. he wrote: thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death. now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible. two fingers of his right hand were inkstained. it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. some nosing zealot in the ministry (a woman, probably; someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the fiction department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen, what he had been writing—and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose. he put the diary away in the drawer. it was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. a hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious. with the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved. oceanofpdf.com iii w inston was dreaming of his mother. he must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. she was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father’s shoes) and wearing spectacles. the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties. at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. he did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. both of them were looking up at him. they were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. they were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. there was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight forever. he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here. he knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things. he could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. it was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one’s intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his mother’s death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there were still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. his mother’s memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. such things, he saw, could not happen today. today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking. suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. the landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country. it was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women’s hair. somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees. the girl with dark hair was coming toward him across the field. with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him; indeed, he barely looked at it. what overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a"
orwell,"whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. winston woke up with the word “shakespeare” on his lips. the telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. it was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a member of the outer party received only three thousand clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pajamas was six hundred—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. the physical jerks would begin in three minutes. the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. his veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. “thirty to forty group!” yapped a piercing female voice. “thirty to forty group! take your places, please. thirties to forties!” winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym shoes, had already appeared. “arms bending and stretching!” she rapped out. “take your time by me. one, two, three, four! one, two, three, four! come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! one, two, three four! one, two, three, four! . . .” the pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winston’s mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. as he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. it was extraordinarily difficult. beyond the late fifties everything faded. when there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. everything had been different then. even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. airstrip one, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called england or britain, though london, he felt fairly certain, had always been called london. winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester. he did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father’s hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest. his mother, in her slow dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. she was carrying his baby sister—or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station. there were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other. winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk. the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair; his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. he reeked of gin. it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. in his childish way winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. it also seemed to him that he knew what it was. someone whom the old man loved, a little granddaughter perhaps, had been killed. every few minutes the old man kept repeating: “we didn’t ought to ’ave trusted ’em. i said so, ma, didn’t i? that’s what come of trusting ’em. i said so all along. we didn’t ought to ’ave trusted the buggers.” but which buggers they didn’t ought to have trusted winston could not now remember. since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself, some of which he remembered vividly. but to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. at this moment, for example, in (if it was ), oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia. in no public or"
orwell,"private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. actually, as winston well knew, it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia. but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. officially the change of partners had never happened. oceania was at war with eurasia: therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia. the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible. the frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles)—the frightening thing was that it might all be true. if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened —that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death. the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia. he, winston smith, knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago. but where did that knowledge exist? only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. “who controls the past,” ran the party slogan, “controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.” and yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. it was quite simple. all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. “reality control,” they called it; in newspeak, “doublethink.” “stand easy!” barked the instructress, a little more genially. winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air. his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink. to know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself—that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. even to understand the word “doublethink” involved the use of doublethink. the instructress had called them to attention again. “and now let’s see which of us can touch our toes!” she said enthusiastically. “right over from the hips, please, comrades. one- two! one- two! . . .” winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit. the half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. the past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother. he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. in the party histories, of course, big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days. his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motor cars or horse carriages with glass sides. there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented. winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence. he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before , but it was possible that in its oldspeak form—“english socialism,” that is to say—it had been current earlier. everything melted into mist. sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. it was not true, for example, as was claimed in the party history books, that the party had invented airplanes. he remembered airplanes since his earliest childhood. but you could prove nothing. there was never any evidence. just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of a historical fact. and on that occasion— “smith!” screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. “ smith w! yes, you! bend lower, please! you can do better than that. you’re not trying. lower, please! that’s better, comrade. now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.” a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winston’s body. his face remained completely inscrutable. never show dismay! never show resentment! a single flicker of the eyes could give you away. he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head and—one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency—bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes. “ there, comrades! that’s how i want to see you doing it. watch me again. i’m thirty-nine and i’ve had four children. now look.” she bent over again. “you see my knees aren’t bent. you can all do it if"
orwell,"you want to,” she added as she straightened herself up. “anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes. we don’t all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit. remember our boys on the malabar front! and the sailors in the floating fortresses! just think what they have to put up with. now try again. that’s better, comrade, that’s much better,” she added encouragingly as winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years. oceanofpdf.com iv w ith the deep , unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day’s work started, winston pulled the speakwrite toward him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk. in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices. to the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of winston’s arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. this last was for the disposal of wastepaper. similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes. when one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of wastepaper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building. winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled. each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated jargon—not actually newspeak, but consisting largely of newspeak words—which was used in the ministry for internal purposes. they ran: times .. bb speech malreported africa rectify times .. forecasts yp th quarter misprints verify current issue times .. miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify times .. reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside. it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last. the other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures. winston dialed “back numbers” on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes’ delay. the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify. for example, it appeared from the times of the seventeenth of march that big brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa. as it happened, the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone. it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother’s speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened. or again, the times of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of , which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth three-year plan. today’s issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. winston’s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones. as for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. as short a time ago as february, the ministry of plenty had issued a promise (a “categorical pledge” were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during . actually, as winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grams to twenty at the end of the present week. all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april. as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames. what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of the times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead. this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound tracks, cartoons, photographs—to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance. day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date. in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct; nor was any item of news, or any"
orwell,"expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record. all history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. in no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place. the largest section of the records department, far larger than the one on which winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction. a number of the times which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made. even the written instructions which winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed; always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy. but actually, he thought as he readjusted the ministry of plenty’s figures, it was not even forgery. it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. most of the material that you were dealing with had no connection with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connection that is contained in a direct lie. statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. for example, the ministry of plenty’s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at a hundred and forty-five million pairs. the actual output was given as sixty-two millions. winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. in any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than a hundred and forty-five millions. very likely no boots had been produced at all. likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot. and so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain. winston glanced across the hall. in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. he looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winston’s direction. winston hardly knew tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on. people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs. in the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate. he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in, day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. there was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier. and a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and meters, was engaged in producing garbled versions—definitive texts, they were called—of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies. and this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the records department. beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. there were the huge printing shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. there was the teleprograms section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall. there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. and somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who coordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence. and the records department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programs, plays, novels—with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child’s spelling book to a newspeak dictionary. and the ministry had"
orwell,"not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally. here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime, and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator. there was even a whole sub-section— pornosec, it was called in newspeak—engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at. three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working; but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him. when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle, took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning. winston’s greatest pleasure in life was in his work. most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem—delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say. winston was good at this kind of thing. on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the times leading articles, which were written entirely in newspeak. he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier. it ran: times .. reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling. in oldspeak (or standard english) this might be rendered: the reporting of big brother’s order for the day in the times of december rd is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to nonexistent persons. rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing. winston read through the offending article. big brother’s order for the day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses. a certain comrade withers, a prominent member of the inner party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the order of conspicuous merit, second class. three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given. one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen. that was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced. the great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special showpieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. more commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again. one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. in some cases they might not even be dead. perhaps thirty people personally known to winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another. winston stroked his nose gently with a paper clip. in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite. he raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash. winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself. it was perfectly possible. so tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person; on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said. and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth. winston did not know why withers had been disgraced. perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies. or perhaps—what was likeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government. the only real clue lay in the words “refs unpersons,” which indicated that withers was already dead. you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested. sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed. very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time forever. withers, however, was already an unperson. he did not exist: he had never existed. winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother’s speech. it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject. he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of overproduction in the ninth three-year plan, might complicate the records too much. what was needed was a piece of pure"
orwell,"fantasy. suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready-made as it were, the image of a certain comrade ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances. there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed. today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy. it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence. winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite toward him and began dictating in big brother’s familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them (“what lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades? the lessons—which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc—that,” etc., etc.), easy to imitate. at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a submachine gun, and a model helicopter. at six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he had joined the spies; at nine he had been a troop leader. at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies. at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior anti-sex league. at nineteen he had designed a hand grenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one eurasian prisoners in one burst. at twenty-three he had perished in action. pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all—an end, said big brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy. big brother added a few remarks on the purity and singlemindedness of comrade ogilvy’s life. he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty. he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally. winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit; in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail. once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle. something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself. there was no way of knowing whose version would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. comrade ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones. comrade ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as charlemagne or julius caesar. oceanofpdf.com v i n the low-ceilinged canteen, deep under ground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward. the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin. on the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip. “just the man i was looking for,” said a voice at winston’s back. he turned round. it was his friend syme, who worked in the research department. perhaps “friend” was not exactly the right word. you did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades; but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others. syme was a philologist, a specialist in newspeak. indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary. he was a tiny creature, smaller than winston, with dark hair and large, protuberant eyes, at once mournful and derisive, which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you. “i wanted to ask you whether you’d got any razor blades,” he said. “not one!” said winston with a sort of guilty haste. “i’ve tried all over the place. they don’t exist any longer.” everyone kept asking you for razor blades. actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up. there had been a famine of them for months past. at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops were unable to supply. sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. you could only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on the “free” market. “i’ve been using the same blade for six weeks,” he added untruthfully. the queue gave another jerk forward. as they halted he turned and faced syme again. each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the edge of the counter. “did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?” said syme. “i was working,” said winston indifferently. “i shall see it on the flicks, i suppose.” “a very inadequate substitute,” said syme. his mocking eyes roved over winston’s face. “i know you,” the eyes seemed to say, “i see through you. i know very well why you didn’t go to see those prisoners hanged.” in an intellectual way, syme was venomously orthodox. he would"
orwell,"talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages, the trials and confessions of thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love. talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting. winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes. “it was a good hanging,” said syme reminiscently. “i think it spoils it when they tie their feet together. i like to see them kicking. and above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue—a quite bright blue. that’s the detail that appeals to me.” “nex’, please!” yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle. winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. onto each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch—a metal pannikin of pinkish-gray stew, a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless victory coffee, and one saccharine tablet. “there’s a table over there, under that telescreen,” said syme. “let’s pick up a gin on the way.” the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. they threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays onto the metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew, a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down. when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry. he began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. from the table at winston’s left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which pierced the general uproar of the room. “how is the dictionary getting on?” said winston, raising his voice to overcome the noise. “slowly,” said syme. “i’m on the adjectives. it’s fascinating.” he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak. he pushed his pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting. “the eleventh edition is the definitive edition,” he said. “we’re getting the language into its final shape—the shape it’s going to have when nobody speaks anything else. when we’ve finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. you think, i dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. but not a bit of it! we’re destroying words—scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. we’re cutting the language down to the bone. the eleventh edition won’t contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year .” he bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls, then continued speaking, with a sort of pedant’s passion. his thin dark face had become animated, his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy. “it’s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. it isn’t only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. after all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? a word contains its opposite in itself. take ‘good,’ for instance. if you have a word like ‘good,’ what need is there for a word like ‘bad’? ‘ungood’ will do just as well—better, because it’s an exact opposite, which the other is not. or again, if you want a stronger version of ‘good,’ what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like ‘excellent’ and ‘splendid’ and all the rest of them? ‘plusgood’ covers the meaning, or ‘doubleplusgood’ if you want something stronger still. of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of newspeak there’ll be nothing else. in the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words—in reality, only one word. don’t you see the beauty of that, winston? it was b.b.’s idea originally, of course,” he added as an afterthought. a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston’s face at the mention of big brother. nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm. “you haven’t a real appreciation of newspeak, winston,” he said almost sadly. “even when you write it you’re still thinking in oldspeak. i’ve read some of those pieces that you write in the times occasionally. they’re good enough, but they’re translations. in your heart you’d prefer to stick to oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. you don’t grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. do you know that newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?” winston did know that, of course. he smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. syme bit off another fragment of the dark-colored bread, chewed it briefly, and went on: “don’t you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. already, in the eleventh edition, we’re not far from that point. but the process will still be continuing long after you and i are dead. every year fewer and fewer words, and"
orwell,"the range of consciousness always a little smaller. even now, of course, there’s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. it’s merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. but in the end there won’t be any need even for that. the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect. newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc is newspeak,” he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. “has it ever occurred to you, winston, that by the year , at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?” “except—” began winston doubtfully, and then stopped. it had been on the tip of his tongue to say “except the proles,” but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. syme, however, had divined what he was about to say. “the proles are not human beings,” he said carelessly. “by —earlier, probably—all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared. the whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. chaucer, shakespeare, milton, byron—they’ll exist only in newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. even the literature of the party will change. even the slogans will change. how could you have a slogan like ‘freedom is slavery’ when the concept of freedom has been abolished? the whole climate of thought will be different. in fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think. orthodoxy is unconsciousness.” one of these days, thought winston with sudden deep conviction, syme will be vaporized. he is too intelligent. he sees too clearly and speaks too plainly. the party does not like such people. one day he will disappear. it is written in his face. winston had finished his bread and cheese. he turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. at the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. a young woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to winston, was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said. from time to time winston caught some such remark as “i think you’re so right, i do so agree with you,” uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice. but the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking. winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the fiction department. he was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. his head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to winston two blank discs instead of eyes. what was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth, it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. just once winston caught a phrase—“complete and final elimination of goldsteinism”—jerked out very rapidly and, as it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. for the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. and yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. he might be denouncing goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the eurasian army, he might be praising big brother or the heroes on the malabar front—it made no difference. whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure ingsoc. as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy. it was not the man’s brain that was speaking; it was his larynx. the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck. syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. the voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din. “there is a word in newspeak,” said syme. “i don’t know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. it is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings. applied to an opponent, it is abuse; applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.” unquestionably syme will be vaporized, winston thought again. he thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that syme despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. there was something subtly wrong with syme. there was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. you could not say that he was unorthodox. he believed in the principles of ingsoc, he venerated big brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary party member did not approach. yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. he said things that would have been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the chestnut tree café, haunt of painters and musicians. there was no law, not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the chestnut tree café, yet the place was somehow ill-omened. the old, discredited leaders of the party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged. goldstein himself, it was"
orwell,"said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. syme’s fate was not difficult to foresee. and yet it was a fact that if syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, winston’s, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the thought police. so would anybody else, for that matter, but syme more than most. zeal was not enough. orthodoxy was unconsciousness. syme looked up. “here comes parsons,” he said. something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, “that bloody fool.” parsons, winston’s fellow tenant at victory mansions, was in fact threading his way across the room—a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. at thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. his whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, gray shirt, and red neckerchief of the spies. in visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. parsons did, indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. he greeted them both with a cheery “hullo, hullo!” and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face. his powers of sweating were extraordinary. at the community center you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle. syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying it with an ink pencil between his fingers. “look at him working away in the lunch hour,” said parsons, nudging winston. “keenness, eh? what’s that you’ve got there, old boy? something a bit too brainy for me, i expect. smith, old boy, i’ll tell you why i’m chasing you. it’s that sub you forgot to give me.” “which sub is that?” said winston, automatically feeling for money. about a quarter of one’s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them. “for hate week. you know—the house-by-house fund. i’m treasurer for our block. we’re making an all-out effort—going to put on a tremendous show. i tell you, it won’t be my fault if old victory mansions doesn’t have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street. two dollars you promised me.” winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which parsons entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate. “by the way, old boy,” he said, “i hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday. i gave him a good dressing down for it. in fact i told him i’d take the catapult away if he does it again.” “i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,” said winston. “ah, well—what i mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn’t it? mischievous little beggars they are, both of them, but talk about keenness! all they think about is the spies, and the war, of course. d’you know what that little girl of mine did last saturday, when her troop was on a hike out berkhampstead way? she got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. they kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when they got into amersham, handed him over to the patrols.” “what did they do that for?” said winston, somewhat taken aback. parsons went on triumphantly: “my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute, for instance. but here’s the point, old boy. what do you think put her onto him in the first place? she spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes—said she’d never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before. so the chances were he was a foreigner. pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?” “what happened to the man?” said winston. “ah, that i couldn’t say, of course. but i wouldn’t be altogether surprised if—” parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion. “good,” said syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper. “of course we can’t afford to take chances,” agreed winston dutifully. “what i mean to say, there is a war on,” said parsons. as though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads. however, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the ministry of plenty. “comrades!” cried an eager youthful voice. “attention, comrades! we have glorious news for you. we have won the battle for production! returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than twenty per cent over the past year. all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us. here are some of the completed figures. foodstuffs—” the phrase “our new, happy life” recurred several times. it had been a favorite of late with the ministry of plenty. parsons, his attention caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified boredom. he could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. he had lugged out a"
orwell,"huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco. with the tobacco ration at a hundred grams a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe up to the top. winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. the new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grams a week. and only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grams a week. was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grams. syme, too—in some more complex way, involving doublethink—syme swallowed it. was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory? the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. as compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses, more furniture, more cooking pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters, more books, more babies—more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity. year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards. as syme had done earlier, winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-colored gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. he meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. had it always been like this? had food always tasted like this? he looked round the canteen. a low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to. it was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different. in any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes, furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-colored, tea a rarity, coffee filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient—nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin. and though, of course, it grew worse as one’s body aged, was it not a sign that this was not the natural order of things, if one’s heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity, the interminable winters, the stickiness of one’s socks, the lifts that never worked, the cold water, the gritty soap, the cigarettes that came to pieces, the food with its strange evil tastes? why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different? he looked round the canteen again. nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls. on the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetlelike man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side. how easy it was, thought winston, if you did not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the party as an ideal—tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt, carefree—existed and even predominated. actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in airstrip one were small, dark, and ill-favored. it was curious how that beetlelike type proliferated in the ministries: little dumpy men, growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. it was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the party. the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth. “the ministry of plenty’s certainly done a good job this year,” he said with a knowing shake of his head. “by the way, smith old boy, i suppose you haven’t got any razor blades you can let me have?” “not one,” said winston. “i’ve been using the same blade for six weeks myself.” “ah, well—just thought i’d ask you, old boy.” “sorry,” said winston. the quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the ministry’s announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. for some reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs. parsons, with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs. parsons would be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. o’brien would be vaporized. parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. the little beetlelike men who scuttled so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of ministries—they, too, would never be vaporized. and the girl with dark hair, the girl from the fiction department—she would never be vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish, though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to"
orwell,"say. at this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk. the girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him. it was the girl with dark hair. she was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity. the instant that she caught his eye she looked away again. the sweat started out on winston’s backbone. a horrible pang of terror went through him. it was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind. why was she watching him? why did she keep following him about? unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards. but yesterday, at any rate, during the two minutes hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so. quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough. his earlier thought returned to him: probably she was not actually a member of the thought police, but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all. he did not know how long she had been looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control. it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. the smallest thing could give you away. a nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. in any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offense. there was even a word for it in newspeak: facecrime, it was called. the girl had turned her back on him again. perhaps after all she was not really following him about; perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running. his cigarette had gone out, and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table. he would finish smoking it after work, if he could keep the tobacco in it. quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. parsons had begun talking again. “did i ever tell you, old boy,” he said, chuckling round the stem of his pipe, “about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market-woman’s skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of b.b.? sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches. burned her quite badly, i believe. little beggars, eh? but keen as mustard! that’s a first-rate training they give them in the spies nowadays—better than in my day, even. what d’you think’s the latest thing they’ve served them out with? ear trumpets for listening through keyholes! my little girl brought one home the other night—tried it out on our sitting room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole. of course it’s only a toy, mind you. still, gives ’em the right idea, eh?” at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle. it was the signal to return to work. all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of winston’s cigarette. oceanofpdf.com vi w inston was writing in his diary: it was three years ago. it was on a dark evening, in a narrow side street near one of the big railway stations. she was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light. she had a young face, painted very thick. it was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips. party women never paint their faces. there was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens. she said two dollars. i — for the moment it was too difficult to go on. he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring. he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice. or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him. your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system. at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom. he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back: a quite ordinary-looking man, a party member, aged thirty-five or forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief case. they were a few meters apart when the left side of the man’s face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. it happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual. he remembered thinking at the time: that poor devil is done for. and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious. the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. there was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see. he drew in his breath and went on"
orwell,"writing: i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen. there was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low. she — his teeth were set on edge. he would have liked to spit. simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine, his wife. winston was married—had been married, at any rate; probably he still was married, for so far as he knew his wife was not dead. he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odor of the basement kitchen, an odor compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. only the proles used scent. in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication. when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts. consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break. it was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labor camp: not more, if you had committed no other offense. and it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act. the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves. some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink. tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed. mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless, and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members. but—though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening. the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though the principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another. the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party. sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. this again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards. there were even organizations such as the junior anti-sex league, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination ( artsem, it was called in newspeak) and brought up in public institutions. this, winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party. the party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it. he did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so. and so far as the women were concerned, the party’s efforts were largely successful. he thought again of katharine. it must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted. it was curious how seldom he thought of her. for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married. they had only been together for about fifteen months. the party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children. katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements. she had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it. very early in their married life he had decided—though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people—that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered. she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none, that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her. “the human sound track” he nicknamed her in his own mind. yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing—sex. as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen. to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression. she would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting. it was extraordinarily embarrassing and, after a while, horrible. but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this. they must, she said, produce a child if they could. so the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible. she used even to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. she had two names for it. one was “making a baby,” and the other was “our duty to the party”"
orwell,"(yes, she had actually used that phrase). quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round. but luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted. winston sighed inaudibly. he picked up his pen again and wrote: she threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt. i — he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharine’s white body, frozen forever by the hypnotic power of the party. why did it always have to be like this? why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years? but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event. the women of the party were all alike. chastity was as deeply ingrained in them as party loyalty. by careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them. his reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it. they were all impregnable, as the party intended that they should be. and what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. the sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion. desire was thoughtcrime. even to have awakened katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife. but the rest of the story had got to be written down. he wrote: i turned up the lamp. when i saw her in the light — after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright. for the first time he could see the woman properly. he had taken a step toward her and then halted, full of lust and terror. he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out; for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment. if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do—! it had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed. what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old. the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask. there were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness. she had no teeth at all. he wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting: when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least. but i went ahead and did it just the same. he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. he had written it down at last, but it made no difference. the therapy had not worked. the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever. oceanofpdf.com vii if there is hope [wrote winston] it lies in the proles. if there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, eighty-five per cent of the population of oceania, could the force to destroy the party ever be generated. the party could not be overthrown from within. its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another. even if the legendary brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflection of the voice; at the most, an occasional whispered word. but the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning. surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? and yet—! he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices—women’s voices—had burst from a side street a little way ahead. it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud “oh-o-o-o-oh!” that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell. his heart had leapt. it’s started! he had thought. a riot! the proles are breaking loose at last! when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans. they were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking pots of any kind were always difficult to get. now the supply had unexpectedly given out. the successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamored round the stall, accusing the stallkeeper of favoritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. there was a fresh outburst of yells. two bloated women,"
orwell,"one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another’s hands. for a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. winston watched them disgustedly. and yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered? he wrote: until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious. that, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks. the party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage. before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. but simultaneously, true to the principles of doublethink, the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules. in reality very little was known about the proles. it was not necessary to know much. so long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance. left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. they were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. to keep them in control was not difficult. a few agents of the thought police moved always among them, spreading false rumors and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party. it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations. and even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because, being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. the larger evils invariably escaped their notice. the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes. even the civil police interfered with them very little. there was a vast amount of criminality in london, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance. in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code. the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them. promiscuity went unpunished; divorce was permitted. for that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it. they were beneath suspicion. as the party slogan put it: “proles and animals are free.” winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. it had begun itching again. the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like. he took out of the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs. parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary: in the old days [it ran], before the glorious revolution, london was not the beautiful city that we know today. it was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under. children no older than you are had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters, who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water. but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them. these rich men were called capitalists. they were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page. you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. this was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it. the capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. they owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. if anyone disobeyed them they could throw him into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death. when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as “sir.” the chief of all the capitalists was called the king, and — but he knew the rest of the catalogue. there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o’-nine-tails, the lord mayor’s banquet, and the practice of kissing the pope’s toe. there was also something called the jus primae"
orwell,"noctis, which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children. it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories. how could you tell how much of it was lies? it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution. the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different. it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve. great areas of it, even for a party member, were neutral and nonpolitical, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. the ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face. the reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. he seemed to see a vision of london, vast and ruinous, city of a million dust bins, and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs. parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe. he reached down and scratched his ankle again. day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved. the party claimed, for example, that today forty per cent of adult proles were literate; before the revolution, it was said, the number had only been fifteen per cent. the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only a hundred and sixty per thousand, whereas before the revolution it had been three hundred—and so it went on. it was like a single equation with two unknowns. it might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy. for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat. everything faded into mist. the past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. just once in his life he had possessed— after the event: that was what counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification. he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds. in , it must have been—at any rate, it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted. but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier. the story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all. by none of them was left, except big brother himself. all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries. goldstein had fled and was hiding, no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. among the last survivors were three men named jones, aaronson, and rutherford. it must have been in that these three had been arrested. as often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way. they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted party members, intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people. after confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important. all three had written long, abject articles in the times, analyzing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends. some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree café. he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye. they were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic early days of the party. the glamor of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. he had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother. but also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two. no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end. they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the"
orwell,"grave. there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them. it was not wise even to be seen in the neighborhood of such people. they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavored with cloves which was the speciality of the café. of the three, it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston. rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution. even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the times. they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing. always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats—an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past. he was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy gray hair, his face pouched and seamed, with protuberant lips. at one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging sloping bulging, falling away in every direction. he seemed to be breaking up before one’s eyes, like a mountain crumbling. it was the lonely hour of fifteen. winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time. the place was almost empty. a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. the three men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking. uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin. there was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out, but no game started. and then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens. the tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too. there came into it—but it was something hard to describe. it was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note; in his mind winston called it a yellow note. and then a voice from the telescreen was singing: “under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me: there lie they, and here lie we under the spreading chestnut tree.” the three men never stirred. but when winston glanced again at rutherford’s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. and for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses. a little later all three were rearrested. it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their re-lease. at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones. they were executed, and their fate was recorded in the party histories, a warning to posterity. about five years after this, in , winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube onto his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten. the instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance. it was a half-page torn out of the times of about ten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included the date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york. prominent in the middle of the group were jones, aaronson, and rutherford. there was no mistaking them; in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom. the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil. they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia, and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets. the date had stuck in winston’s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. there was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies. of course, this was not in itself a discovery. even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. but this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. it was enough to blow the party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known. he had gone straight on working. as soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper. luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen. he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair, so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. to keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort; but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him. then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers. within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes. that was ten—eleven years ago. today, probably, he would have kept that photograph. it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event"
orwell,"it recorded, was only memory. was the party’s hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed? but today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. already, at the time when he made his discovery, oceania was no longer at war with eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country. since then there had been other changes—two, three, he could not remember how many. very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. the past not only changed, but changed continuously. what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken. the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious. he took up his pen again and wrote: i understand how: i do not understand why. he wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic. perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable. he might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him; the horror was that he might also be wrong. he picked up the children’s history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece. the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you—something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. in the end the party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it. it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it. not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy. the heresy of heresies was common sense. and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. for, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? or that the force of gravity works? or that the past is unchangeable? if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then? but no! his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord. the face of o’brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind. he knew, with more certainty than before, that o’brien was on his side. he was writing the diary for o’brien— to o’brien; it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its color from that fact. the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. it was their final, most essential command. his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer. and yet he was in the right! they were wrong and he was right. the obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. truisms are true, hold onto that! the solid world exists, its laws do not change. stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the earth’s center. with the feeling that he was speaking to o’brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. if that is granted, all else follows. oceanofpdf.com viii f rom somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not victory coffee—came floating out into the street. winston paused involuntarily. for perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood. then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound. he had walked several kilometers over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community center: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the center were carefully checked. in principle a party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. it was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreations; to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. there was a word for it in newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him. the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the center, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. on impulse he had turned away from the bus stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself along unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going. “if there is hope,” he had written in the diary, “it lies in the proles.” the words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth"
orwell,"and a palpable absurdity. he was somewhere in the vague, brown-colored slums to the north and east of what had once been saint pancras station. he was walking up a cobbled street of little two-story houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of rat holes. there were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles. in and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alleyways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. most of the people paid no attention to winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached. “‘yes,’ i says to ’er, ‘that’s all very well,’ i says. ‘but if you’d of been in my place you’d of done the same as what i done. it’s easy to criticize,’ i says, ‘but you ain’t got the same problems as what i got.’” “ah,” said the other, “that’s jest it. that’s jest where it is.” the strident voices stopped abruptly. the women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. but it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. the blue overalls of the party could not be a common sight in a street like this. indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. the patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. “may i see your papers, comrade? what are you doing here? what time did you leave work? is this your usual way home?”—and so on and so forth. not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route, but it was enough to draw attention to you if the thought police heard about it. suddenly the whole street was in commotion. there were yells of warning from all sides. people were shooting into the doorways like rabbits. a young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement. at the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran toward winston, pointing excitedly to the sky. “steamer!” he yelled. “look out, guv’nor! bang over’ead! lay down quick!” “steamer” was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. winston promptly flung himself on his face. the proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. they seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly traveled faster than sound. winston clasped his forearms about his head. there was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered onto his back. when he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window. he walked on. the bomb had demolished a group of houses two hundred meters up the street. a black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming round the ruins. there was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. when he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast. he kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side street to the right. within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. it was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking shops which the proles frequented (“pubs,” they called them) were choked with customers. from their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. in an angle formed by a projecting house front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder. even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. it was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. he was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. for a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows. “can’t you bleeding well listen to what i say? i tell you no number ending in seven ain’t won for over fourteen months!” “yes, it ’as, then!” “no, it ’as not! back ’ome i got the ’ole lot of ’em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper. i takes ’em down reg’lar as the clock. an’ i tell you, no number ending in seven—” “yes, a seven ’as won! i could pretty near tell you the bleeding number. four oh seven, it ended in. it were in february—second week in"
orwell,"february.” “february your grandmother! i got it all down in black and white. an’ i tell you, no number—” “oh, pack it in!” said the third man. they were talking about the lottery. winston looked back when he had gone thirty meters. they were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. the lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. it was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. it was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. where the lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. there was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. winston had nothing to do with the running of the lottery, which was managed by the ministry of plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being nonexistent persons. in the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange. but if there was hope, it lay in the proles. you had to cling onto that. when you put it in words it sounded reasonable; it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. the street into which he had turned ran downhill. he had a feeling that he had been in this neighborhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. from somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. the street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stallkeepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. at this moment winston remembered where he was. the alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. and in a small stationer’s shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink. he paused for a moment at the top of the steps. on the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. a very old man, bent but active, with white mustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. as winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the revolution happened. he and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. in the party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the revolution. the older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender. if there was anyone still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into winston’s mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. he would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him. he would say to him: “tell me about your life when you were a boy. what was it like in those days? were things better than they are now, or were they worse?” hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. it was madness, of course. as usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. if the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe him. he pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. as he entered, the din of voices dropped to about half its volume. behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. a game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds. the old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. a knot of others, standing round with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene. “i arst you civil enough, didn’t i?” said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously. “you telling me you ain’t got a pint mug in the ’ole bleeding boozer?” “and what in hell’s name is a pint?” said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter. “’ark at ’im! calls ’isself a barman and don’t know what a pint is! why, a pint’s the ’alf of a quart, and there’s four quarts to the gallon. ’ave to teach you the a, b, c next.” “never heard of ’em,” said the barman shortly. “liter and half-liter—that’s all we serve. there’s the glasses on the shelf in front of you.” “i likes a pint,” persisted the old man. “you could ’a drawed me off a pint easy enough. we didn’t ’ave these bleeding liters when i was a young man.” “when you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,” said"
orwell,"the barman, with a glance at the other customers. there was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by winston’s entry seemed to disappear. the old man’s white-stubbled face had flushed pink. he turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into winston. winston caught him gently by the arm. “may i offer you a drink?” he said. “you’re a gent,” said the other, straightening his shoulders again. he appeared not to have noticed winston’s blue overalls. “pint!” he added aggressively to the barman. “pint of wallop.” the barman swished two half-liters of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs. the proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. the game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. winston’s presence was forgotten for a moment. there was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard. it was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in. “’e could ’a drawed me off a pint,” grumbled the old man as he settled down behind his glass. “a ’alf liter ain’t enough. it don’t satisfy. and a ’ole liter’s too much. it starts my bladder running. let alone the price.” “you must have seen great changes since you were a young man,” said winston tentatively. the old man’s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the gents, as though it were in the barroom that he expected the changes to have occurred. “the beer was better,” he said finally. “and cheaper! when i was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint. that was before the war, of course.” “which war was that?” said winston. “it’s all wars,” said the old man vaguely. he took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again. “’ere’s wishing you the very best of ’ealth!” in his lean throat the sharp-pointed adam’s apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished. winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-liters. the old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full liter. “you are very much older than i am,” said winston. “you must have been a grown man before i was born. you can remember what it was like in the old days, before the revolution. people of my age don’t really know anything about those times. we can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be true. i should like your opinion on that. the history books say that life before the revolution was completely different from what it is now. there was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty—worse than anything we can imagine. here in london, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. half of them hadn’t even boots on their feet. they worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. and at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were called—who were rich and powerful. they owned everything that there was to own. they lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats—” the old man brightened suddenly. “top ’ats!” he said. “funny you should mention ’em. the same thing come into my ’ead only yesterday, i donno why. i was jest thinking, i ain’t seen a top ’at in years. gorn right out, they ’ave. the last time i wore one was at my sister-in-law’s funeral. and that was—well, i couldn’t give you the date, but it must’a been fifty years ago. of course it was only ’ired for the occasion, you understand.” “it isn’t very important about the top hats,” said winston patiently. “the point is, these capitalists—they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were the lords of the earth. everything existed for their benefit. you—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves. they could do what they liked with you. they could ship you off to canada like cattle. they could sleep with your daughters if they chose. they could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o’-nine-tails. you had to take your cap off when you passed them. every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who—” the old man brightened again. “lackeys!” he said. “now there’s a word i ain’t ’eard since ever so long. lackeys! that reg’lar takes me back, that does. i recollect—oh, donkey’s years ago—i used to sometimes go to ’yde park of a sunday afternoon to ’ear the blokes making speeches. salvation army, roman catholics, jews, indians—all sorts there was. and there was one bloke—well, i couldn’t give you ’is name, but a real powerful speaker ’e was. ’e didn’t ’alf give it ’em! ‘lackeys!’ ’e says, ‘lackeys of the bourgeoisie! flunkies of the ruling class!’ parasites—that was another of them. and ’yenas—’e definitely called ’em ’yenas. of course ’e was referring to the labour party, you understand.” winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross purposes. “what i really wanted to know was this,” he said. “do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days? are you treated more like a human being? in the old days, the rich people, the people at the top—” “the ’ouse of lords,” put in the old man reminiscently. “the house of lords, if you like. what i"
orwell,"am asking is, were these people able to treat you as an inferior, simply because they were rich and you were poor? is it a fact, for instance, that you had to call them ‘sir’ and take off your cap when you passed them?” the old man appeared to think deeply. he drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering. “yes,” he said. “they liked you to touch your cap to ’em. it showed respect, like. i didn’t agree with it, myself, but i done it often enough. had to, as you might say.” “and was it usual—i’m only quoting what i’ve read in history books—was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter?” “one of ’em pushed me once,” said the old man. “i recollect it as if it was yesterday. it was boat race night—terrible rowdy they used to get on boat race night—and i bumps into a young bloke on shaftesbury avenue. quite a gent, ’e was—dress shirt, top ’at, black overcoat. ’e was kind of zigzagging across the pavement, and i bumps into ’im accidental-like. ’e says, ‘why can’t you look where you’re going?’ ’e says. i says, ‘ju think you’ve bought the bleeding pavement?’ ’e says, ‘i’ll twist your bloody ’ead off if you get fresh with me.’ i says, ‘you’re drunk. i’ll give you in charge in ’alf a minute,’ i says. ’an if you’ll believe me, ’e puts ’is ’and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus. well, i was young in them days, and i was going to ’ave fetched ’im one, only—” a sense of helplessness took hold of winston. the old man’s memory was nothing but a rubbish heap of details. one could question him all day without getting any real information. the party histories might still be true, after a fashion; they might even be completely true. he made a last attempt. “perhaps i have not made myself clear,” he said. “what i’m trying to say is this. you have been alive a very long time; you lived half your life before the revolution. in , for instance, you were already grown up. would you say, from what you can remember, that life in was better than it is now, or worse? if you could choose, would you prefer to live then or now?” the old man looked meditatively at the darts board. he finished up his beer, more slowly than before. when he spoke it was with a tolerant, philosophic air, as though the beer had mellowed him. “i know what you expect me to say,” he said. “you expect me to say as i’d sooner be young again. most people’d say they’d sooner be young, if you arst ’em. you got your ’ealth and strength when you’re young. when you get to my time of life you ain’t never well. i suffer something wicked from my feet, and my bladder’s jest terrible. six and seven times a night it ’as me out of bed. on the other ’and there’s great advantages in being a old man. you ain’t got the same worries. no truck with women, and that’s a great thing. i ain’t ’ad a woman for near on thirty year, if you’d credit it. nor wanted to, what’s more.” winston sat back against the window sill. it was no use going on. he was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. the extra half-liter was already working on him. winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, “was life better before the revolution than it is now?” would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. but in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. they remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister’s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago; but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. they were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. and when memory failed and written records were falsified—when that happened, the claim of the party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested. at this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly. he halted and looked up. he was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops, interspersed among dwelling houses. immediately above his head there hung three discolored metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. he seemed to know the place. of course! he was standing outside the junk shop where he had bought the diary. a twinge of fear went through him. it had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to come near the place again. and yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. it was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary. at the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open. with the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway. if questioned, he could plausibly say that he was trying"
orwell,"to buy razor blades. the proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell. he was a man of perhaps sixty, frail and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles. his hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black. his spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. his voice was soft, as though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles. “i recognized you on the pavement,” he said immediately. “you’re the gentleman that bought the young lady’s keepsake album. that was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. cream laid, it used to be called. there’s been no paper like that made for—oh, i dare say fifty years.” he peered at winston over the top of his spectacles. “is there anything special i can do for you? or did you just want to look round?” “i was passing,” said winston vaguely. “i just looked in. i don’t want anything in particular.” “it’s just as well,” said the other, “because i don’t suppose i could have satisfied you.” he made an apologetic gesture with his soft-palmed hand. “you see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. between you and me, the antique trade’s just about finished. no demand any longer, and no stock either. furniture, china, glass—it’s all been broken up by degrees. and of course the metal stuff’s mostly been melted down. i haven’t seen a brass candlestick in years.” the tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. the floor-space was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture frames. in the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends—lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches, and the like—which looked as though they might include something interesting. as winston wandered toward the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up. it was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat on the other, making almost a hemisphere. there was a peculiar softness, as of rainwater, in both the color and the texture of the glass. at the heart of it, magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone. “what is it?” said winston, fascinated. “that’s coral, that is,” said the old man. “it must have come from the indian ocean. they used to kind of embed it in the glass. that wasn’t made less than a hundred years ago. more, by the look of it.” “it’s a beautiful thing,” said winston. “it is a beautiful thing,” said the other appreciatively. “but there’s not many that’d say so nowadays.” he coughed. “now, if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that’d cost you four dollars. i can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds, and eight pounds was—well, i can’t work it out, but it was a lot of money. but who cares about genuine antiques nowadays—even the few that’s left?” winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket. what appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. the soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. the thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. it was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. it was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a party member to have in his possession. anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. the old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. winston realized that he would have accepted three or even two. “there’s another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,” he said. “there’s not much in it. just a few pieces. we’ll do with a light if we’re going upstairs.” he lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots. winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in. there was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace. an old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it. “we lived here till my wife died,” said the old man half apologetically. “i’m selling the furniture off by little and little. now that’s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it. but i dare say you’d find it a little bit cumbersome.” he was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. the thought flitted through winston’s mind"
orwell,"that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. it was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. it seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob, utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock. “there’s no telescreen!” he could not help murmuring. “ah,” said the old man, “i never had one of those things. too expensive. and i never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow. now that’s a nice gateleg table in the corner there. though of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.” there was a small bookcase in the other corner, and winston had already gravitated toward it. it contained nothing but rubbish. the hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else. it was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than . the old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed. “now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—” he began delicately. winston came across to examine the picture. it was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front. there was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue. winston gazed at it for some moments. it seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue. “the frame’s fixed to the wall,” said the old man, “but i could unscrew it for you, i dare say.” “i know that building,” said winston finally. “it’s a ruin now. it’s in the middle of the street outside the palace of justice.” “that’s right. outside the law courts. it was bombed in—oh, many years ago. it was a church at one time. st. clement’s dane, its name was.” he smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added: “ oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement’s! ” “what’s that?” said winston. “oh— oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement’s. that was a rhyme we had when i was a little boy. how it goes on i don’t remember, but i do know it ended up, here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head. it was a kind of a dance. they held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you. it was just names of churches. all the london churches were in it—all the principal ones, that is.” winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. it was always difficult to determine the age of a london building. anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the middle ages. the centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. one could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books. statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered. “i never knew it had been a church,” he said. “there’s a lot of them left, really,” said the old man, “though they’ve been put to other uses. now, how did that rhyme go? ah! i’ve got it! oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement’s, you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin’s — there, now, that’s as far as i can get. a farthing, that was a small copper coin, looked something like a cent.” “where was st. martin’s?” said winston. “st. martin’s? that’s still standing. it’s in victory square, alongside the picture gallery. a building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.” winston knew the place well. it was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of rocket bombs and floating fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like. “st. martin’s in the fields it used to be called,” supplemented the old man, “though i don’t recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.” winston did not buy the picture. it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame. but he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not weeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shopfront—but charrington. mr. charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it. all the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through winston’s head: oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement’s, you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st. martin’s! it was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a"
orwell,"lost london that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. from one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing. he got away from mr. charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitering the street before stepping out of the door. he had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a month, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the center. the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. however—! yes, he thought again, he would come back. he would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. he would buy the engraving of st. clement’s danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls. he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr. charrington’s memory. even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. for perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out onto the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window. he had even started humming to an improvised tune— oranges and lemons, say the bells of st. clement’s, you owe me three farthings, say the— suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water. a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten meters away. it was the girl from the fiction department, the girl with dark hair. the light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. she looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him. for a few seconds winston was too paralyzed to move. then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction. at any rate, one question was settled. there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. she must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure back street, kilometers distant from any quarter where party members lived. it was too great a coincidence. whether she was really an agent of the thought police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. it was enough that she was watching him. probably she had seen him go into the pub as well. it was an effort to walk. the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away. the worst thing was the pain in his belly. for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind. the street was a blind alley. winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his steps. as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. but he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. he could not run, he could not strike a blow. besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. he thought also of hurrying to the community center and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. but that too was impossible. a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him. all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet. it was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. the lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin. then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. but he did not open it at once. from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness. it was at night that they came for you, always at night. the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. undoubtedly some people did so. many of the disappearances were actually suicides. but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable. he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed. he might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough; but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one’s own body. even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. and it is the same, he perceived,"
orwell,"in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. on the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralyzed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth. he opened the diary. it was important to write something down. the woman on the telescreen had started a new song. her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. he tried to think of o’brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away. it would not matter if they killed you at once. to be killed was what you expected. but before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the groveling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair. why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time? he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o’brien. “we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,” o’brien had said to him. he knew what it meant, or thought he knew. the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. he put a cigarette in his mouth. half the tobacco promptly fell out onto his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. the face of big brother swam into his mind, displacing that of o’brien. just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. the face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting, but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark mustache? like a leaden knell the words came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength. oceanofpdf.com two oceanofpdf.com i i t was the middle of the morning, and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory. a solitary figure was coming toward him from the other end of the long, brightly lit corridor. it was the girl with dark hair. four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk shop. as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same color as her overalls. probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were “roughed in.” it was a common accident in the fiction department. they were perhaps four meters apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. she must have fallen right on the injured arm. winston stopped short. the girl had risen to her knees. her face had turned a milky yellow color against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain. a curious emotion stirred in winston’s heart. in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him; in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. already he had instinctively started forward to help her. in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body. “you’re hurt?” he said. “it’s nothing. my arm. it’ll be all right in a second.” she spoke as though her heart were fluttering. she had certainly turned very pale. “you haven’t broken anything?” “no, i’m all right. it hurt for a moment, that’s all.” she held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up. she had regained some of her color, and appeared very much better. “it’s nothing,” she repeated shortly. “i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. thanks, comrade!” and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. not to let one’s feelings appear in one’s face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. there was no question that she had done it intentionally. it was something small and flat. as he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. it was a scrap of paper folded into a square. while he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded. obviously"

only a year ago, circumstances had been dramatically more hopeful. the entrepreneur had been widely celebrated as a titan of her industry, a leader of society and a philanthropist. she was in her late thirties, steering the technology company she founded in her dorm room in college to ever-increasing levels of marketplace dominance while producing products that her customers revered. yet now she was being blindsided, facing a mean-spirited and jealousy-fueled coup that would significantly dilute her ownership stake in the business she’d invested most of her life building, forcing her to find a new job. the cruelty of this remarkable turn of events was proving to be unbearable for the entrepreneur. beneath her regularly icy exterior beat a caring, compassionate and deeply loving heart. she felt life itself had betrayed her. and that she deserved so much better. she considered swallowing a gigantic bottle of sleeping pills. the dangerous deed would be cleaner this way. just take them all and get the job done fast, she thought. i need to escape this pain. then, she spotted something on the stylish oak dresser in her all-white bedroom—a ticket to a personal optimization conference that her mother had given her. the entrepreneur usually laughed at people who attended such events, calling them “broken winged” and saying they"

becoming legendary “do not allow your fire to go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not at all. do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach. the world you desire can be won. it exists. it is real. it is possible. it is yours.” —ayn rand he was a speaker of the finest kind. a genuine spellbinder. nearing the end of a fabled career and now in his eighties, he had become revered throughout the world as a grandmaster of inspiration, a legend of leadership and a sincere statesman helping everyday people realize their greatest gifts. in a culture filled with volatility, uncertainty and insecurity, the spellbinder’s events drew stadium-sized numbers of human beings who longed not only to lead masterful lives filled with creativity, productivity and prosperity but also to exist in a way that passionately elevated humanity. so that, at the end, they would feel confident they had left a wonderful legacy and made their mark on the generations that would follow. this man’s work was unique. it blended insights that fortified the warrior within our characters with ideas that honored the soulful poet who resides inside the heart. his messaging showed ordinary individuals how to succeed at the highest levels of the business realm yet reclaim the magic of a life richly lived. so, we return to the sense of awe we once knew before a hard and cold world placed our natural genius into bondage by an orgy of complexity, superficiality and technological distraction. though the spellbinder was tall, his advanced years left him slightly bent over. as he walked the platform, he stepped carefully yet gracefully. a precisely fitted charcoal gray suit with soft white pinstripes gave him an elegant look. and a pair of blue-tinted eyeglasses added just the right amount of cool. “life’s too short to play small with your talents,” the spellbinder spoke to the room of thousands. “you were born into the opportunity as well as the responsibility to become legendary. you’ve been built to achieve masterwork-level projects, designed to realize unusually important pursuits and constructed to be a force for good on this tiny planet. you have it in you to reclaim sovereignty over your primal greatness in a civilization that has become fairly uncivilized. to restore your nobility in a global community where the majority shops for nice shoes and acquires expensive things yet rarely invests in a better self. your personal leadership requires—no, demands—that you stop being a cyber-zombie relentlessly attracted to digital devices and restructure your life to model mastery, exemplify decency and relinquish the self-centeredness that keeps good people limited. the great women and men of the world were all givers, not takers. renounce the common delusion that those who accumulate the most win. instead, do work that is heroic—that staggers your marketplace by the quality of its originality as well as from the helpfulness it provides. while you do so, my recommendation is that you also create a private life strong in ethics, rich with marvelous beauty and unyielding when it comes to the protection of your inner peace. this, my friends, is how you soar with the angels. and walk alongside the gods.” the spellbinder paused. he drew in a gulp of air, as big as a mountain. his breathing grew strained and made a whooshing noise as he inhaled. he looked down at his stylish black boots that had been polished up to a military grade. those in the front row saw a single tear drizzle down the timeworn yet once-handsome face. his gaze remained downward. his silence was thunderous. the spellbinder appeared unsteady. after a series of stressful moments that had some in the audience shifting in their seats, the spellbinder put down the microphone he had been holding in his left hand. with his free hand, he tenderly reached into a pocket of his trousers and pulled out a crisply folded linen handkerchief. he wiped his cheek. “each of you has a call on your lives. every one of you carries an instinct for excellence within your spirits. no one in this room needs to stay frozen in average and succumb to the mass mediocratization of behavior evident in society along with the collective de-professionalization of business so apparent in industry. limitation is nothing more than a mentality that too many good people practice daily until they believe it’s reality. it breaks my heart to see so many potentially powerful human beings stuck in a story about why they can’t be extraordinary, professionally and personally. you need to remember that your excuses are seducers, your fears are liars and your doubts are thieves.” many nodded. a few clapped. then many more applauded. “i understand you. i really do,” continued the spellbinder. “i know you’ve had some difficult times in your life. we all have. i get that you might be feeling things haven’t turned out the way you thought they would when you were a little kid, full of fire, desire and wonder. you didn’t plan on each day looking the same, did you? in a job that might be smothering your soul. dealing with stressful worries and endless responsibilities that stifle your originality and steal your energy. lusting after unimportant pursuits and hungry for the instant fulfillment of trivial desires, often driven by a technology that enslaves us instead of liberating us. living the same week a few thousand times and calling it a life. i need to"
sharma,"tell you that too many among us die at thirty and are buried at eighty. so, i do get you. you hoped things would be different. more interesting. more exciting. more fulfilling, special and magical.” the spellbinder’s voice trembled as he spoke these last words. he struggled to breathe for an instant. a look of concern caused his brow to crinkle. he sat down on a cream-colored chair that had been carefully placed at the side of the stage by one of his assistants. “and, yes, i am aware that there are also many in this room who are currently leading lives you love. you’re an epic success in the world, fully on your game and enriching your families and communities with an electricity that borders on otherworldly. nice work. bravo. and, yet, you too have experienced seasons where you’ve been lost in the frigid and dangerous valley of darkness. you, too, have known the collapse of your creative magnificence as well as your productive eminence into a tiny circle of comfortableness, fearfulness and numbness that betrayed the mansions of mastery and reservoirs of bravery inside of you. you, too, have been disappointed by the barren winters of a life weakly lived. you, too, have been denied many of your most inspired childhood dreams. you, too, have been hurt by people you trusted. you, too, have had your ideals destroyed. you, too, have had your innocent heart devastated, leaving your life decimated, like a ruined country after ambitious foreign invaders infiltrated it.” the cavernous conference hall was severely still. “no matter where you are on the pathway of your life, please don’t let the pain of an imperfect past hinder the glory of your fabulous future. you are so much more powerful than you may currently understand. splendid victories—and outright blessings—are coming your way. and you’re exactly where you need to be to receive the growth necessary for you to lead the unusually productive, extremely prodigious and exceptionally influential life that you’ve earned through your harshest trials. nothing is wrong at this moment, even if it feels like everything’s falling apart. if you sense your life’s a mess right now, this is simply because your fears are just a little stronger than your faith. with practice, you can turn down the volume of the voice of your scared self. and increase the tone of your most triumphant side. the truth is that every challenging event you’ve experienced, each toxic person that you’ve encountered and all the trials you’ve endured have been perfect preparation to make you into the person that you now are. you needed these lessons to activate the treasures, talents and powers that are now awakening within you. nothing was an accident. zero was a waste. you’re definitely exactly where you

harder in reality,” shouted a man in a red baseball cap, seated in the fifth row. he sported a gray t-shirt and ripped jeans, the type you can buy torn at your local shopping mall. though this outburst could have seemed disrespectful, the pitch of the participant’s voice and his body language displayed genuine admiration for the spellbinder. “i agree with you, you wonderful human being,” responded the spellbinder, his grace influencing all participants and his voice sounding somewhat stronger, as he stood up from his chair. “ideas are worth nothing unless backed by application. the smallest of implementations is always worth more than the grandest of intentions. and if being an amazing person and developing a legendary life was easy, everyone would be doing it. know what i mean?” “sure, dude,” replied the man in the red cap as he rubbed his lower lip with a finger. “society has sold us a series of mistruths,” the spellbinder continued. “that pleasure is preferable to the terrifying yet majestic fact that all possibility requires hard work, regular reinvention and a dedication as deep as the sea to leaving our harbors of safety, daily. i believe that the seduction of complacency and an easy life is one hundred times more brutal, ultimately, than a life where you go all in and take an unconquerable stand for your brightest dreams. world-class begins where your comfort zone ends is a rule the successful, the influential and the happiest always remember.” the man nodded. groups of people in the audience were doing the same. “from a young age, we are programmed into thinking that moving through life loyal to the values of mastery, ingenuity and decency should need little effort. and so, if the road gets tough and requires some patience, we think we’re on the wrong path,” commented the spellbinder as he grasped an arm of the wooden chair and folded his thin frame into the seat again. “we’ve encouraged a culture of soft, weak and delicate people who can’t keep promises, who bail on commitments and who quit on their aspirations the moment the smallest obstacle shows up.” the orator then sighed loudly. “hard is good. real greatness and the realization of your inherent genius is meant to be a difficult sport. only those devoted enough to go to the fiery edges of their highest limits will expand them. and the suffering that happens along the journey of materializing your special powers, strongest abilities and most inspiring ambitions is one of the largest sources of human satisfaction. a major key to happiness—and internal peace—is knowing you’ve done whatever it took to earn your rewards and passionately invested the effortful audacity to become your best. jazz legend miles davis stretched himself ferociously past the

spends huge amounts of their irreplaceable lifetime watching streams of selfies, the breakfasts of virtual friends and violent video games,” noted the spellbinder as he peered around the hall as if committed to looking each of the attendees straight in the eye. “stephen king worked as a high school writing teacher and in an industrial laundry before selling carrie , the novel that made him famous,” the aging presenter continued. “oh, and please know that king was so discouraged by the rejections and denials that he threw the manuscript he wrote in his rundown trailer into the garbage, surrendering to the struggle. it was only when his wife, tabitha, discovered the work while her husband was away, wiped off his cigarette ashes, read the book and then told its author that it was brilliant that king submitted it for publication. even then, his advance for hardcover rights was a paltry twenty-five hundred dollars.” “are you serious?” murmured a woman seated near the stage. she wore a lush green hat with a big scarlet feather sticking out of it and was clearly content with marching to her own drumbeat. “i am,” said the spellbinder. “and while vincent van gogh created nine hundred paintings and over one thousand drawings in his lifetime, his celebrity started after his death. his drive to produce wasn’t inspired by the ego fuel of popular applause but by a wiser instinct that enticed him to see just how much of his creative power he could unlock, no matter how much hardship he had to endure. becoming legendary is never easy. but i’d prefer that journey to the heartbreak of being stuck in ordinary that so many potentially heroic people deal with constantly,” articulated the spellbinder firmly. “anyway, let me simply say that the place where your greatest discomfort lies is also the spot where your largest opportunity lives. the beliefs that disturb you, the feelings that threaten you, the projects that unnerve you and the unfoldments of your talents that the insecure part of you is resisting are precisely where you need to go to. lean deeply toward these doorways into your bigness as a creative producer, seeker of personal freedom and possibilitarian. and then embrace these beliefs, feelings and projects quickly instead of structuring your life in a way that’s designed to dismiss them. walking into the very things that scare you is how you reclaim your forgotten power. and how you get back the innocence and awe you lost after childhood.” suddenly, the spellbinder started to cough. mildly at first. then violently, like he’d been possessed by a demon hell-bent on revenge. in the wings, a man in a black suit with an aggressive crew cut spoke into a mouthpiece tucked discreetly into his shirt cuff. the lights began to flicker, then dim. a few audience members who were located near the platform stood, unsure of what to do. a uniquely pretty woman with her hair in a crisp bun, a clenched smile and a tight black dress with an embroidered white collar rushed up the metal staircase that the spellbinder had ascended at the beginning of his talk. she carried a phone in one hand and a well-worn notebook in another. her red high heels made a “click clack, click clack” sound as she raced toward her employer. yet, the woman was too late. the spellbinder crumpled to the floor like a punch-drunk boxer with a large heart but weak skills in the final round of a once-glorious career that he should have ended many years earlier. the old presenter lay still. a tiny river of blood escaped from a cut to his head, sustained on his fall. his glasses sat next to him. the handkerchief was still in his hand. his once-sparkling eyes remained closed. oceanofpdf.com c hapter an unexpected encounter with a surprising stranger “do not

roman emperor the entrepreneur lied to the people she met at the seminar, telling them she was in the room to learn the spellbinder’s fabulous formulas for exponential productivity as well as to discover the neuroscience beneath personal mastery that he had been sharing with leaders of industry. she mused that her expectation was that the guru’s methodology would give her an unmatchable edge over her firm’s competition, allowing the business to swiftly scale toward indisputable dominance. you know the real reason she was there: she needed her hope restored. and her life saved. the artist had come to the event to understand how to fuel his creativity and multiply his capability so he could make an enduring mark on his field by the paintings he generated. and the homeless man appeared to have sneaked into the conference hall while no one was watching. the entrepreneur and the artist had been seated together. this was the first time they’d met. “do you think he’s dead?” she asked as the artist fidgeted with his dangling bob marley dreadlocks. the entrepreneur’s face was angular and long. a wealth of wrinkles and weighty crevices ran along her forehead like ruts in a farmer’s fresh field. her brown hair was medium in length and styled in an “i mean business and dare not mess with me” kind of a way. she was lean, like a long-distance runner, with thin arms and lithe legs that emerged from a sensible blue designer skirt. her eyes looked sad, from old hurts that had never been healed. and"

you into what the old-timer said?” continued the scruffy stranger. “def,” said the artist. “i love his work. i have a hard time living it all, but what he says is profound. and powerful.” “i’m not so sure,” the entrepreneur said cynically. “i like a lot of what i heard today, but i’m still not convinced on some other things. i’ll need some time to process it all.” “well, i think he’s numero uno,” stated the homeless man with a burp. “i made my fortune thanks to the teachings of the spellbinder. and have enjoyed a pretty world-class life because of him, too. most people wish for phenomenal things to happen to them. he taught me that exceptional performers make phenomenal things happen to them. and the great thing is, he not only gave me a secret philosophy to get my big dreams done but he taught me the technology—the tactics and tools—to translate the information into results. his revolutionary insights on how to install a fiercely productive morning routine alone transformed the impact i’ve had on my marketplace.” a jagged scar ran along the homeless man’s forehead, just above his right eye. his threatening beard was gray. around his neck he sported a beaded necklace, like the ones indian holy men wear at their temples. though his hyperbole made him sound unstable and his visage made it appear that he’d lived on the streets for many years, his voice displayed an irregular sense of authority. and his eyes revealed the confidence of a lion. “total crackpot,” the entrepreneur whispered to the artist. “if he’s got a fortune, i’m mother teresa.” “got you. he seems insane,” the artist replied. “but check out his humungous watch.” on the left wrist of the homeless man, who seemed to be in his late sixties, was one of those massive timepieces that british hedge fund managers are prone to wear when they go out to dinner in mayfair. it had a dial the color of a revolver surrounded by a stainless-steel rim, a red needle-thin hour hand and a sunset orange minute hand. this noteworthy badge of honor was united with a wide black rubber strap, lending a diver-like feel to the whole luxurious look. “a hundred grand, easily,” said the entrepreneur discreetly. “some of the people at my shop bought watches like that the day after our ipo. unfortunately, our share price plummeted. but they kept their damn timepieces.” “so, what part of the spellbinder’s talk did you cats like best?” the vagabond asked, still scratching his wrist. “was it all the stuff about the psychology of genius that he started out with? or maybe those incredible models he taught on the productivity hacks of billionaires that he jammed on in the middle? maybe you were stoked by all the neurobiology that creates top performance. or did you vibe with his theory on our responsibility to reach legendary while serving as an instrument for the benefit of humanity that he walked us through before that dramatic finish?” the homeless man then winked. and glanced at his big watch. “hey, dudes, this has been fun. but time is one of the most precious commodities i’ve learned to"

picasso said you should learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist. need to be myself and not some sheep with no balls, blindly following the flock down a path that leads to nowhere. most people, especially people with cash, are nothing but a bunch of frauds,” declared the artist. “it’s like the spellbinder sometimes says: ‘you can fit in. or you can change the world. you don’t get to do both.’ so, i recorded the whole thing. shoot me. and jail would be interesting. i’d probably meet some cool people in there.” “um, okay,” said the homeless man. “i don’t like your decision. but i do love your passion. so, go ahead. bring it on. play the parts of the seminar that turned you on.” “everything i recorded will blow your mind!” the artist raised his arm to reveal a detailed tattoo of guitar virtuoso jimi hendrix. the phrase “when the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace” appeared over the dead superstar’s face. “you’re about to hear something special,” he added. “yes. go ahead and play the parts you liked,” encouraged the entrepreneur as she stood up. she wasn’t quite sure why but, ever so slightly, something was beginning to shift deep within her core. “maybe life has been breaking me down,” she thought. “so i can make some sort of a breakthrough.” being at this event, meeting the artist, hearing the spellbinder’s words, even if she didn’t agree with all he said, was giving her the feeling that what she was experiencing at her firm just might be some form of preparation demanded by her greatness. the entrepreneur was still skeptical. but she sensed she was opening. and possibly growing. so, she promised herself she’d keep following this process instead of retreating. her former way of existing no longer served her. it was time for a change. the entrepreneur thought about a quote she loved from theodore roosevelt: “it’s not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” she also recalled the phrase she’d learned from the spellbinder’s address—something like “the moment when you most feel like giving up is the instant when you must find it in you to press ahead.” and so, the businesswoman reached deep within herself and made a vow to continue her quest to find her answers, solve her problems and experience vastly better days. her hope was gradually expanding, and her worries were slowly shrinking. and the small, still voice of her finest self was beginning to whisper that a very special adventure was about to begin. oceanofpdf.com c hapter letting go of mediocrity and all that’s ordinary “why, sometimes i’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” —lewis carroll, alice in wonderland “you’re a painter, right?” the homeless man asked"

homeless man, smiling indulgently. “bought a place right on the bahnhofstrasse just before the prices skyrocketed. i’ve learned the importance of being around only the highest quality, wherever i go. that’s one of the best winning moves i’ve made to create the life i’ve crafted. in my businesses, i only allow in top players, because you can’t have an a-level company with c-level performers. we only release products that totally disrupt our market and then absolutely change the field by how valuable they are. my enterprises only offer services that ethically enrich our clients, deliver a breathtaking user experience and breed fanatical followers who couldn’t imagine doing business with anyone else. and in my personal life, it’s the same thing: i only eat the best food, though i don’t eat a lot of it. i only read the most original and thoughtful books, spend my time in the most light-filled and inspiring of spaces and visit the most enchanting of places. and when it comes to relationships, i only surround myself with human beings who fuel my joy, stoke my peace and excite me to become a better man. life’s way too valuable to hang with people who don’t get you. who you just don’t vibe with. who have different values and lower standards than you do. who have different mindsets, heartsets, healthsets and soulsets. it’s a little miracle how powerfully and profoundly our influences and environments shape our productivity as well as our impact.” “interesting,” noted the entrepreneur as she stared at her phone. “he does seem to know what he’s talking about,” she muttered softly to the artist, her eyes still down on the screen. the spider’s web of wrinkles on her face relaxed further. on one wrist dangled two immaculate silver bracelets. one bore the phrase “turn i cant’s into i cans,” while the other was engraved with “done is better than perfect.” the entrepreneur had purchased these presents for herself when her company was in its startup phase and she’d been in a highly confident mood. “i know about mindsets,” said the artist. “never heard of heartsets, healthsets and soulsets, man.” “you will,” suggested the homeless man. “and once you do, the way you create, produce and show up in your world will never be the same. seriously revolutionary concepts for any empire-maker and world-builder. and so few businesspeople and other human beings on the planet currently know about them. if they did, every important element of their lives would increase rapidly. for now, i just wanted to keep jamming on my personal commitment to ultra-high

ideas that elevate an entire generation, you know. and i need to say that uplifting humankind is the master sport of business that the top % play. the real purpose of commerce is not only to make your personal fortune. the true reason to be in the game is to be helpful to society. my main focus in business is to serve. money, power and prestige are just the inevitable by-products that have shown up for me along the way. an old and remarkable friend taught me this way of operating when i was a young man. it totally transformed the state of my prosperity and the magnitude of my private freedom. and this contrarian business philosophy has dominated my way of doing things ever since. who knows, maybe i’ll introduce my mentor to you sometime.” the vagrant paused. he studied his large watch. next he closed his eyes and said these words: “own your morning. elevate your life.” as if by magic, a fairly small and quite thick piece of white paper appeared in the palm of his outstretched left hand. it was quite a trick. you would have been exceedingly impressed if you were standing there with these three souls. here’s what the image on the paper looked like: mae besom the entrepreneur and the artist both had their mouths open at this point, appearing to be both confused and mesmerized. “you two each have a hero inside of you. you knew this as a child before adults told you to limit your powers, shackle your genius and betray the truths of your heart,” the homeless man told them, sounding a lot like the spellbinder. “adults are deteriorated children,” he went on. “when you were much younger, you understood how to live. staring at stars filled you with delight. running in a park made you feel alive. and chasing butterflies flooded you with joy. oh, how i adore butterflies. then, as you grew up, you forgot how to be human. you forgot how to be bold and enthusiastic and loving and wildly alive. your precious reservoirs of hope faded. being ordinary became acceptable. the lamp of your creativity, your positivity and your intimacy with your greatness grew dim as you began to worry about fitting in, having more than others and being popular. well, here’s what i say: participate not in the world of numbed-out grownups, with its scarcity, apathy and limitation. i’m inviting you to enter a secret reality known only to the true masters, great geniuses and genuine legends of history. and to discover primal powers within you that you never knew were there. you can create magic in your work and personal lives. i sure have. and i’m here to help you do so.” before the entrepreneur and the artist could utter even a word, the homeless man"

and tragedy is nature’s great purifier. it burns away the fakeness, fear and arrogance that is of the ego. returns us to our brilliance and genius, if you have the courage to go into that which wounds you. suffering yields many rewards, including empathy, originality, relatability and authenticity. jonas salk said, ‘i have had dreams and i’ve had nightmares, but i have conquered my nightmares because of my dreams,’” the uninvited vagabond added wistfully. “he’s super-weird. incredibly eccentric. but there’s something special to him,” admitted the entrepreneur quietly to the artist, removing just a little more of the armor of cynicism that had protected her over her stellar career. “what he just said is exactly what i’ve needed to hear. i get that he looks like he lives in a cardboard box on the streets. but listen to his words. sometimes he speaks like a poet. how could he be so articulate? where did his depth come from? and who is this ‘old friend’ he says has taught him so much? he also has a warmth that reminds me of my dad. i still miss him. he was my confidant. my top supporter. and my best friend. i think of him every day.” “okay,” said the artist to the quirky stranger. “you asked me what i liked best from the talk. i def liked the part where the spellbinder talked about the spartan warrior credo that says, ‘one who sweats more in training bleeds less in war.’ and i liked his line ‘high victory is made in those early morning hours when no one’s watching and while everyone else is sleeping.’ his teachings on the value of a world-class morning routine were great.” the entrepreneur glanced down at her device. “i’ve taken some good notes. but i didn’t pick up those gems,” she said as she captured what she had just heard. “we only hear what we’re ready to hear,” observed the homeless man sagely. “all learning meets us exactly where we’re at. and as we grow greater, we understand better.” the voice of the spellbinder suddenly rang out. the homeless man’s eyes looked as huge as the taj mahal. one could see he was terrifically surprised to hear that famous tone. he spun around—seeking the source. quickly, all became clear. the artist was playing his illicit recording from the seminar. “here’s the part i liked most, to fully answer your question, brother,” he stated, staring directly into the eyes of the shabby tramp. in a culture of cyber-zombies, addicted to distraction and afflicted with interruption, the wisest way to guarantee that you consistently produce mastery-level results in the most important areas of your professional and personal life is to install a world-class morning routine. winning starts at your beginning. and your first hours are when heroes are made. wage a war against weakness and launch a campaign against fearfulness. you truly can get up early. and doing so is a necessity in your awesome pursuit toward legendary. take excellent care of the front end of your day, and the rest of your day will pretty much take care of itself. own your morning. elevate your life. the spellbinder could be heard wheezing like a novice swimmer who went too far, too fast. the artist continued presenting his recording, turning up the volume so the sound was blaring. here’s the precious little secret that the titans of industry, the standout performers of artistry and the ultra-achievers of humanity will never share with you: gargantuan results are much less about your inherited genetics and far more about your daily habits. and your morning ritual is by far the most essential one to calibrate. and then automate. when we see the icons in action, the forceful seduction sold to us by our civilization is to believe they were always that great. that they were born into their exceptionalism. that they won the fortunate dna lottery. that their genius was inherited. yet the truth is that we are watching them in their full blazing glory after years of following a process, one that involved ceaseless hours of practice. when we observe magnificent players in business, sport, science and the arts we are observing the earned results of a monomaniacal concentration around a single pursuit, astronomical focus on one skill, intensity of sacrifice applied to one aim, unusual levels of deep preparation and extreme amounts of solid patience. remember, every professional was once an amateur, and every master started as a beginner. ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary feats, once they’ve routinized the right habits. “this cat is so solid,” said the homeless man. he clapped his dirty hands like a kid at a carnival. he checked his watch yet again. then he began to shuffle his feet while swaying his hips forward then backward. his hands were now waving in the air and he"
sharma,"was snapping his fingers, with closed eyes again. sounds like the early rappers used to make without their boom boxes emerged from his cracked lips. you would have been astonished to watch him in action. “what the hell are you doing?” shouted the artist. “dancing,” replied the homeless man, moving gloriously. “keep bringing me this beautiful knowledge. socrates said, ‘education is the kindling of a flame.’ and isaac asimov wrote ‘self-education is, i believe, the only kind of education there is.’ so, keep playing the old guru’s words, dude. it’s all so gnarly.” the artist resumed the recording: heavily resist all piracy of your mastery from this world tempting you into distractibility and causing digital dementia. force your attention back to the everests of potential aching for fuller expression and, today, release all reasons that feed any stagnation of your strengths. start being an imaginationalist—one of those rare individuals who leads from the nobility of your future versus via the prison bars of your past. each of us thirsts for days filled with tiny bursts of the miraculous. every one of us wishes to own our pure heroism and step into unchained exceptionalism. all human beings alive at this moment have a primitive psychological need to produce masterworks that wow, live daily amidst uncommon awe and know that we are somehow spending our hours in a way that enriches the lives of others. the poet thomas campbell said it beautifully when he observed, “to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.” each of us—truly—has been built to make history, in our own authentic way. for one, this might mean being an excellent coder or a fine teacher who lifts young minds. for another, this opportunity could mean becoming a tremendous mother or a magnificent manager. to yet another, this good fortune may mean growing a great business or being a fantastic salesperson who serves customers superbly. this chance to be remembered by future generations and lead a life that truly matters is not some platitude. this is, in fact, a truth. yet, so few of us have discovered, and then installed, the very mentalities, morning practices and consistent conditions that will guarantee these results appear for us. we all want to reaccess our birthright of towering talent, limitless joy and freedom from fear, but few of us are willing to do the very things that would cause our hidden genius to present itself. strange, right? and it’s very sad. the majority of us have been hypnotized out of the luminosity that is our essence. most of us in this age spend our most valuable hours being busy being busy. chasing trivial pursuits and artificial amusements while neglecting living a real life. this is a formula for heartbreak at the end. what’s the point of spending your best mornings and potentially productive days climbing mountains that you realize were the wrong ones when you are frail and wrinkled? very sad. “that part really resonated with me,” interjected the entrepreneur, slightly emotionally. “i’m definitely addicted to my technology. can’t stop checking everything. first thing in the morning and last thing at night. it’s draining my concentration. i can hardly focus on the important deliverables my team and i have committed to. and all the noise in my life is taking my energy. it all feels so complicated. i just don’t feel i have any time for myself anymore. it’s fairly overwhelming, all the messages and notifications and ads and diversions. and what the spellbinder said is also so helpful to me as i raise my standards as a leader. i’ve sort of hit a wall. my company has grown faster than i ever expected. i’ve become more successful than i ever imagined. but there are some things causing me a ton of stress.” she looked away and crossed her arms again. “i can’t tell them what i’m really dealing with,” thought the entrepreneur. then she continued: “i’ve had to let go of people i really liked because i’ve learned people who fit at one stage of a business’s lifecycle may not work as the firm evolves. that’s been hard. they were the right employees for an earlier time but they don’t belong now. and some things are unfolding at my shop that have turned my life upside down. i don’t really want to get into it. it’s just a very shaky time for me.” “well, on your point about elevating your leadership game,” responded the homeless man, “please remember that the job of the leader is to help disbelievers embrace your vision, the powerless to overcome their weaknesses and the hopeless to develop faith. and what you said on letting go of employees you liked but who no longer fit where your business is now at—that’s a normal part of growing a business. and it happened because they failed to grow as your enterprise rose. they started coasting. they stopped learning, inventing and making everything they touched better than they found it. and as a result they stopped being awesome value incubators for your venture. they likely blamed you. but they did it to themselves,” the uninvited stranger indicated, surprising his listeners by the sophistication of his insights on team-building and winning in commerce. “uh. exactly,” replied the entrepreneur. “so we had to leave them behind since they no longer delivered the results we were paying them for. a lot of nights i wake up at am soaked in steamy sweat. maybe it’s like what f racer mario andretti said: ‘if everything seems under control you’re not going fast enough.’ that’s how i seem to feel most days. we’re blowing past our key performance indicators so quickly it makes my head spin. new teammates to mentor, new brands to manage, new markets to penetrate, new suppliers to watch, new products to refine, new investors and shareholders to impress and a thousand new responsibilities to handle. it really does feel like it’s a lot. i have a huge capacity to"
sharma,"get big things done. but there’s a lot on my shoulders.” the entrepreneur tightened her arms and scrunched her forehead together absentmindedly. her thin lips pulled together like a sea anemone shutting on sensing a fatal predator. and her eyes suggested she was suffering. intensely. “and, about your point about being addicted to technology, just remember that intelligently used, it advances human progress. through using technology wisely our lives become better, our knowledge becomes richer and our wonderful world becomes smaller. it’s the misuse of technology that’s ruining people’s minds, damaging their productivity and destroying the very fabric of our society. your phone is costing you your fortune, you know? if you’re playing with it all day long. and what you just said about all the pressure on you, how fantastic. ‘pressure is a privilege,’ said tennis legend billie jean king,” the homeless man shared. “you get to grow. and ascending as a person is one of the smartest ways to spend the rest of your life. with every challenge comes the gorgeous opportunity to rise into your next level as a leader, performer and human being. obstacles are nothing more than tests designed to measure how seriously you want the rewards that your ambitions seek. they show up to determine how willing you are to improve into the kind of person who can hold that amount of success. failure’s just growth in wolf’s clothing. and pretty much nothing else is as important in life as personal expansion, the unfoldment of your potential. tolstoy wrote, ‘everyone thinks of changing the world but no one thinks of changing himself.’ become a bigger person and you’ll also automatically become a better leader—and a greater producer. and yes, i agree that growth can be scary. but my mentor once taught me that ‘the part of you that clings to fear must experience a sort of crucifixion so that the portion of you that deserves high honor undergoes a kind of reincarnation.’ those are the exact words he shared with me. freaky and deep, right?” said the hobo as he rubbed the holy-man beads he was wearing. he kept going without waiting for an answer. “my special teacher also told me that ‘to find your best self you must lose your weak self.’ and that only happens through relentless improvement, continuous reflection and ongoing self-excavation. if you don’t keep rising daily you’ll get stuck in your life, for the rest of your life. makes me consider what the journalist norman cousins said: ‘the tragedy of life is not death but what we let die inside of us while we live.’” the homeless man raised his raspy voice and observed, “my special teacher taught me that once we transform the primary relationship with ourselves, we’ll find that our relationships with other people, our work, our income and our impact transform. most people can’t stand themselves. so, they can never be alone. and silent. they need to constantly be with other people to escape their feelings of self-hatred over all their wasted potential, missing the wonders and wisdom that solitude and quiet bring. or they watch tv endlessly, not realizing it’s eroding their imagination as well as bankrupting their bank account.” “my life feels so complicated. i feel so overwhelmed. i don’t have any time for myself,” the entrepreneur repeated. “not sure what’s happened to my life. things have just become hard.” “i understand you,” the artist said as he placed an arm over his new friend’s shoulder. “my intuition tells me that you’re going through a lot more than you’re sharing. and that’s okay. you know, some days life seems so messy that i can’t get out of bed. i just lie there, man. i close my eyes and wish the fog in my head would just go away. even for a day. i can’t think straight some of the time. and on those days, my heart has no hope in it at all. it sucks. and a lot of people suck, too, man. i’m not anti-social. i’m just anti-moron. too many dumb people around these days. taking stupid fashion pictures of themselves with pouty lips in clothes they can’t afford. hanging with people they don’t even like. i’d rather live a thoughtful life. a risky life. a real life. an artist’s life. drives me crazy how superficial people have become.” the artist then punched one fist into his other hand. unyielding creases appeared along his jawline and a blue vein twitched in his thick neck. “sure. i got you,” said the homeless man. “life isn’t easy, people. tough slog a lot of the time. but like john lennon said: ‘everything will be okay in the end. and if it’s not okay, it’s not the end,’” he offered kindly, spouting yet another quote from what seemed to be an unlimited supply in his brain. the artist softened instantly, smiling in a way that looked almost sweet. he exhaled mightily. he liked what he’d just heard. “and,” the vagrant continued, “this climb up into the rare-air of personal and professional mastery that the three of us have obviously signed up for is not for the weak. upgrading your life so you know real joy and optimizing your skills so you own your field can be uncomfortable a lot of the time. i need to be honest. but here’s one key thing i’ve learned: the soreness of growth is so much less expensive than the devastating costs of regret.” “where’d you learn that?” questioned the artist, as he scrawled the words into his notebook. “can’t tell you. yet,” the homeless man responded, heightening the mystery of where he’d discovered much of his insight. the entrepreneur turned away from the artist and jotted down some of her thoughts into her device. the homeless man then reached into a pocket of his hole-ridden plaid shirt and produced a heavily used index card. he held it up like a kindergarten student at show-and-tell. “a distinguished person gave this to me"
sharma,"when i was a lot younger, as i was starting my first company. i was a lot like you cats: dripping with dreams and set to make my mark on the world. hungry to prove myself. amped to dominate the game. the first fifty years of our lives are a lot about seeking legitimacy, you know. we crave social approval. we want our peers to respect us. we hope our neighbors will like us. we buy all sorts of things we really don’t need and obsess about making money we really don’t enjoy.” “totally right,” muttered the artist, nodding his head aggressively and shifting his posture noticeably as his dreadlocks dangled over his shoulders. the event venue was now empty. “if we have the courage to look within, we discover that we do this because we have a series of holes within us. we falsely believe that material from the outside will fill what’s empty within ourselves. yet it never will. never will. anyhoo, when many of us reach the half-time point of our lives, we make a right-angle turn. we begin to realize that we’re not going to live forever and that our days are numbered. and so, we connect with our mortality. big point here. we realize we are going to die. what’s truly important comes into much sharper focus. we become more contemplative. we start to wonder if we’ve been true to our talents, loyal to our values and successful on the terms that feel right to us. and we think about what those we most love will say about us when we’re gone. that’s when many of us make a giant shift: from seeking legitimacy in society to constructing a meaningful legacy. the last fifty years then become less about me and more about we . less about selfishness and more about service. we stop adding more things into our lives and begin to subtract—and simplify. we learn to savor simple beauty, experience gratitude for small miracles, appreciate the priceless value of peace of mind, spend more time cultivating human connections and come to understand that the one who gives the most is victorious. and what’s left of your life then becomes a phenomenal dedication to loving life itself as well as a ministry of kindness to the many. and this becomes, potentially, your gateway into immortality.” “he’s really special,” whispered the entrepreneur. “i haven’t felt this hopeful, energized and grounded in months. my father used to help me navigate difficult times,” she told the artist. “ever since he passed away i don’t have anyone to lean on.” “what happened to him?” quizzed the artist. “i’m a little fragile right now, even though i feel stronger now than i did when i walked in here this morning, that’s for sure. but i’ll simply say that he took his own life. dad was a remarkable man—a tremendously successful business pioneer. he flew airplanes, raced fast cars and loved superb wine. he was so alive . then his business partner took everything away from him, not so different from the horrible scenario i’m living right now. anyway, the stress and shock of his world collapsing pushed him to do what we could never have imagined. he just couldn’t see any way out, i guess,” the entrepreneur revealed as her voice broke. “you can lean on me,” the artist said tenderly. he placed a hand with a hippie ring on a pinky finger onto his heart as he spoke these words, looking both chivalrous and bohemian. the homeless man interrupted the intimate moment the two were sharing. “here, read this,” he instructed as he handed over his index card. “it’ll be useful as you both rise to your next performance levels and experience everything that comes with this adventure into human leadership, personal mastery and creating a career of uncommon productivity.” in red lettering over the paper that had yellowed by the advances of time, it read: “ all change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end .” “that’s very good,” noted the entrepreneur. “a valuable piece of information for me. thank you.” the artist then resumed playing his illegal copy of the spellbinder’s presentation: each one of you carries a quiet genius and a triumphant hero within your hearts. dismiss these as idealistic words of an elderly inspirationalist if you wish. but i’m proud to be an idealist. our world needs more of us. and yet, i am also a realist. and here’s the truth: most people on the planet today don’t think much of themselves, unfortunately. they secure their identity by who they are externally. they evaluate their achievement by what they’ve collected versus by the character they’ve cultivated. they compare themselves to the orchestrated—and fake—highlight reels presented by the people they follow. they measure their self-worth by their net worth. and they get kidnapped by the false thought that because something has never been done it can’t be done—depleting the grand and electrifying possibilities their lives are meant to become. this explains why the majority is sinking in the quicksand of uncertainty, boredom, distraction and complexity. “drama mamas,” the homeless man interrupted again. “that’s what i call men and women who’ve caught the virus of victimitis excusitis. all they do is complain about how bad things are for them instead of applying their primal power to make things better. they take instead of give, criticize instead of create and worry instead of work. build antibodies to combat any form of average from getting anywhere near your professional days at the office and your private life at home. never be a drama mama.” the entrepreneur and the artist peeked at each other. then they giggled, both at the terms the quirky stranger was using and at the way he’d raised an arm and made the fingers of one hand into a peace sign as he spoke the words he’d just shared. if you were standing there with them, you would think"
sharma,"he was weird too. the spellbinder could then be heard speaking the following words on the recording with dramatic flair: to be clear, every day—for the rest of your life—you’ll be faced with the chance of showing leadership, wherever you are and in all that you do. leadership isn’t just for global icons and marketplace titans. it’s an arena everyone gets to play in. because leadership is a lot less about having a formal title, a large office and money in the bank. and a lot more about committing to mastery over all you do—and in who you are. it’s about resisting the tyranny of the ordinary, refusing to allow negativity to hijack your sense of awe and preventing any form of slavery to mediocrity from infesting your life. leadership is about making a difference, right where you’re planted. real leadership is about sending out brave work that exemplifies genius, turns your whole field on its head by its scope, innovation and execution, and is so staggeringly sublime that it stands the test of time. and never work only for the income. labor for the impact. make your dominant pursuit the heartfelt release of value that represents an uncommon magic that borders on the poetic. demonstrate the full-on expression of what’s possible for a human being to create. develop the patience to stick with your dedication to absolute world-class output, even if over a lifetime you only generate a single masterpiece. to achieve this feat alone will have made your life’s journey a worthy trek. be a virtuoso. a standout. an exceptionalist. the top % are a lot less concerned with fame, cash and approval and a lot more invested in punching above their weight class within their craft, playing above their pay grade around their talents and creating the kind of productivity that inspires—and serves—millions. that’s often why they make millions. so never mail it in. always bring it on . the homeless man now had his eyes closed. and was down on the floor doing a series of one-armed push-ups. all the while he was chanting, “own your morning. elevate your life.” the entrepreneur and the artist shook their heads. “one of my favorite books is the prophet, ” mused the artist. “it’s one of the bestselling works of poetry ever written. i read that khalil gibran carried the manuscript around with him for four long years and refined it constantly before giving it to his publisher, just so it was pure art. i still remember the exact words he spoke when he was interviewed by a journalist about his creative process because they guide me a lot when i’m in the studio. his words keep me reaching for a greater power as an artist, even though i battle procrastination a lot. like i said, i’m pretty good. but i know i can be great. if i could just beat my self-sabotage. and my demons.” “what did he say?” asked the homeless man, now standing and twiddling with his big watch. beads of perspiration meandered down his angular face. “here’s exactly what he said,” mentioned the artist: “‘i wanted to be sure, very sure, that every word of it was the very best i had to offer.’” “gnarly,” replied the homeless man. “that’s the standard that the best ones always hold themselves to.” abruptly, the spellbinder could be heard coughing in the audio. his comments that followed seemed to struggle out of him, like an unborn child fiercely reluctant to leave the security of its loving mother’s warm and safe womb. anyone can become an everyday leader by showing up as i’m encouraging. when it’s easy and especially when it’s difficult. starting today. and if you do so, a guaranteed victory is in your future. and i need to add that there’s not one person alive today who cannot lift their thinking, performance, vitality, prosperity and lifetime happiness magnificently by wiring in a series of profound daily rituals and then practicing them until they become your second nature. and this brings me to the single most important principle of my talk: the greatest starting point for winning in your work and making a splendid life is joining what i call the am club. how can you ever be world-class if you don’t carve out some time each morning to make yourself world-class? the entrepreneur was now taking notes with a ferocious intensity not previously seen. the artist’s face had a “this makes me feel strong” smile on it. the homeless man burped, then got down to the floor and held a plank, the kind fitness pros at the gym love to do to build a strong core. you could hear the spellbinder begin to cough even more fiercely. a brutal—and sustained—pause followed. next, he uttered these words, haltingly. he was wheezing audibly. his voice began to quiver like a novice telemarketer on her very first sales call. rising at am truly is the mother of all routines. joining the am club is the one behavior that raises every other human behavior. this regimen is the ultimate needle mover to turn you into an undefeatable model of possibility. the way you begin your day really does determine the extent of focus, energy, excitement and excellence you bring to it. each early morning is a page in the story that becomes your legacy. each new dawn is a fresh chance to unleash your brilliance, unprison your potency and play in the big leagues of iconic results. you have such power within you and it reveals itself most with the first rays of daybreak. please do not allow past pains and present frustrations to diminish your glory, stifle your invincibility and choke the unlimited possibilitarian that lurks within the supreme part of you. in a world that seeks to keep you down, build yourself up. in an epoch that wishes you would stay in the dark, step into your light. at a time that mesmerizes you to forget your gifts, reclaim"
sharma,"your genius. our world requires this of each of us. to be champions of our crafts, warriors for our growth and guardians of unconditional love—for all of humankind. display respect and compassion for all other people who occupy this tiny planet, regardless of their creed, color or caste. lift them up in a civilization where many get energy tearing others down. help others sense the marvels that sleep within them. show us the virtues we all wish more would practice. everything i’m saying will speak to the unspoiled part of you, that side of yourself that was ferociously alive before you were taught to fear, hoard, contract and distrust. it’s your job as a hero of your life, as a creative achiever set to change the culture and as a citizen of earth to find this dimension within you. and, once done, to spend the rest of your days reconnected with it. accept this opportunity to human mastery and i promise you that a synchronicity of success as well as an orchestrated magic well beyond the boundaries of logic will infuse the remainder of your days. and the larger angels of your grandest potential will begin to visit you regularly. actually, an orderly series of seemingly impossible miracles will descend onto your most genuine of dreams, causing the best of them to come true. and you will evolve into one of those rare and great spirits who upgrade the whole world by the simple act of walking amongst us. the conference hall was now dark. the entrepreneur let out a sigh the size of mexico city. the artist was motionless. the homeless man began to cry. he then stood on a chair, raised his arms like a preacher and boomed these words of irish playwright george bernard shaw: this is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. i am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and as long as i live it is my privilege to do for it whatever i can. i want to be thoroughly used up when i die, for the harder i work the more i live. i rejoice in life for its own sake. life is no ‘brief candle’ for me. it is a sort of splendid torch which i have got hold of for the moment, and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations. the homeless man then fell to his knees. kissed his holy beads. and continued to weep. oceanofpdf.com c hapter a bizarre adventure into morning mastery “everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure… . the skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.” —johann wolfgang von goethe “if you two are interested,” said the homeless man, “i’d be happy to spend a few mornings coaching you at my oceanside compound. i’ll show you my private morning routine and explain why dialing in the way you run your first hour to the highest degree is essential for personal mastery and exceptional business performance. let me do this for you cats. your lives will start to look glorious—within a fairly short time. and the ride with me will be fun. not always easy, as we heard from the old guy on the stage. but valuable and prolific and beautiful. maybe even as wonderful as the ceiling of the sistine chapel.” “first time i saw it i cried,” the artist said, stroking the hairs of his goatee. “michelangelo was a bad dude. and i mean that in a good way,” the homeless man offered as he, too, played with his beard, which was soiled. he then raised his shirt to show greek god abdominal muscles. a long finger of a grimy hand moved along the contours, the way a raindrop zigzags down the stem of a rose after a may shower. “hit me with a stick,” shouted the artist with the enthusiasm of a cat let loose in a parrot shop. “how the heck did you get those?” “not from some plastic ab machine i bought from a late-night tv show, that’s for sure. work is how i got all lean and chiseled up like this. plenty of push-ups, pull-ups, planks, sit-ups and seriously sweaty cardio sessions, often on my special beach.” the homeless man pulled out an obviously expensive leather wallet, then carefully removed from it a piece of plastic with a drawing on it. here’s what it looked like, so you see exactly what the entrepreneur and the artist saw in that moment: mae besom without allowing for any responses from his two listeners, the disheveled drifter kept on speaking. “commitment, discipline, patience and work. values few believe in these days, where so many have an entitlement mentality, expecting a rich, productive and fulfilling life to just show up one day like a sparrow at the beginning of spring. and expecting everyone around them to invest the effort they are responsible for inputting. where’s the leadership in this way of operating? “a society of adults behaving like spoiled little children is how i sometimes see our world right now. not judging, just saying. not complaining, just reporting. hey, cats, here’s the point i’m trying to make by letting you have a peek at my sculpted abs: nothing works for those who don’t do the work. less talk and more do is what i say. oh, and check this out.” the hobo spun around and unbuttoned his hole-ridden shirt. on his firm, striated back was a tattoo with the words “victims love entertainment. victors adore education.” “come hang with me at my place on a magical little island in"

the reality is that life has got your back, even when it doesn’t look like it does. but you need to do your part and go all in when windows of opportunity appear. oh—and if you come to my home on the island, the only thing i ask is that you stay long enough for me to teach you the philosophy and methodology that my secret adviser shared with me. joining the am club requires a little time.” the homeless man paused before adding, “i’m also going to take care of all your expenses. everything’s covered. i’ll even send my private jet to pick you guys up, if that’s cool.” the entrepreneur and the artist glanced at each other, amused, confounded and entirely uncertain. “mind if my friend and i have a few moments alone, brother?” requested the artist, notebook still in hand. “no sweat. sure. take all the time you need. i’ll just go back to my seat over there and make some calls to my executive team,” mentioned the homeless man as he paced away. “this is absurd. just asinine,” the artist said to the entrepreneur. “i def agree with you that there’s something special about him. maybe even something magical. i know how insane that sounds. and i am fascinated by this mentor he keeps talking about, this teacher who sort of sounds like a modern-day master. i’ll admit that this street person has got some great insights, for sure. and he obviously seems to have a lot of experience. but just look at him! man, the guy looks completely down and out—a complete mess. i don’t think he’s had a shower in weeks. his clothes are all ripped. he’s beyond freaky. and sometimes he talks total crazy talk. we have no idea who he is. this could be dangerous. he could be dangerous.” “yes. definitely super-weird. everything that’s happened here today is super-weird,” confirmed his companion. the entrepreneur’s lean face then softened. her eyes still seemed melancholic, though. “i’m at a place in my life where i need to make some big changes,” she confided. “i just can’t keep going on like this. i hear what you’re saying. i’ve been suspicious of pretty much everyone and everything ever since i lost my dad when i was eleven. a daughter growing up without a father is incredibly scary. to be honest, i still carry a lot of the emotional trauma with me. i think of him every day. i’ve had some bad intimate relationships. i’ve struggled a lot with low self-worth and made some horrible choices in the relationships i’ve had. “about a year ago i started seeing a therapist who made me aware of why i was behaving the way i was behaving,” the entrepreneur continued. “psychologists"
sharma,"call it ‘fatherless daughter syndrome.’ deep within, i had a huge fear of abandonment and all the strong insecurities that come with that wound. yes, this made me extraordinarily tough on the outside. and ruthless in some ways. the chip on my shoulder over the loss of my father gave me my drive and my ambition. yet the loss also left me empty within. i’m learning that i’ve been trying to fill the void that he left, when he left, by pushing myself to exhaustion in my work with the belief that when i’m even more successful i’ll get the love i lost. i’ve been attempting to fill my emotional holes by chasing more money like a heroin addict needing a fix. i’ve been starving for social status and hungry for industry approval—escaping online for quick pleasure hits of entertainment when i could be doing things that matter. as i said, i’m realizing a lot of my behavior has been pushed from the fear created by my early challenges as a young woman. i felt inspired when the spellbinder spoke about never doing something for the money but, instead, reaching for world-class as a leader and a person for the meaning it provides, for the opportunity to grow it provokes and for a shot at changing the world. his words made me feel so hopeful. i want to live in the way he spoke of, but i’m nowhere near that place now. and recently, what’s happened at my company pushed me to the edge. i’m really not doing well at life right now. i only came to this meeting because my mom gave me a free ticket. and i’m so desperate for a change.” the entrepreneur took a deep breath. “sorry,” she apologized, looking embarrassed. “i hardly know you so i’m not sure why i’m revealing all this to you. i guess i just feel safe with you. i’m not sure why. i’m so sorry if i’m oversharing.” “no problem,” said the artist. his body language showed he was engaged. he no longer anxiously played with his goatee and dreadlocks. “we’re so honest when we chat with taxi drivers and other people we don’t really know, right?” the entrepreneur went on. “all i’m trying to say is that i’m ready for a transformation. and my gut tells me this down-and-out man who wants to teach us how an excellent morning routine can build creative, productive, financial and happiness empires really can help me. and help us . “and,” she added, “remember his watch.” “i like him,” said the artist. “he’s a character. i love that he expresses himself so poetically sometimes and so passionately at others. he thinks so vividly and quotes george bernard shaw like his life depended on it. really cool. but i still don’t really trust him,” the artist expressed as he punched a fist into an open palm again. “probably ripped the watch off some rich idiot.” “look, i understand how you’re feeling,” responded the entrepreneur. “a lot of me feels the same way. and you and i just met as well. i’m not sure what it would be like to go on this trip with you. i hope you don’t mind me saying that. you seem like such a nice person. a few rough edges maybe. i think i understand where those come from. but you’re good deep down. i know it.” the artist looked mildly pleased. he glanced at the homeless man, who was eating slices of avocado from a plastic bag. “i’ll have to see if i can arrange my schedule to be away from the office so we can spend time with him ,” shared the entrepreneur as she pointed to the homeless man. while he was munching on his snack he was also talking on a relic of a mobile phone and staring at the ceiling. “i’m starting to like the idea of spending some time near a village called solitude on some tiny island, eating fabulous food and swimming with wild dolphins. i’m beginning to feel this will be a phenomenal adventure. i’m starting to feel more alive again.” “well, now that you say it that way, i’m liking the sound of this, too,” said the artist. “i’m beginning to think there’s a delicious insanity to all of this. a special opportunity to access a whole new universe of originality. this might be the best thing yet for my art. it makes me think of what the writer charles bukowski said: ‘some people never go crazy. what truly horrible lives they must lead.’ and the spellbinder did encourage us to leave the boundaries of our normal lives so we grow into our gifts, talents and strengths. some instinct is also telling me to do this. so, if you go, i’ll go.” “well, you know what? i’ll take the leap. it’s done. i’m all in. let’s go!” pronounced the entrepreneur. “all in,” agreed the artist. they both stood up and made their way to the homeless man, who was now sitting with his eyes closed. “what are you doing now?” quizzed the artist. “intense visualization of all i want to be and the higher order life i wish to create. a turkish fighter pilot once told me that before every flight, he’d ‘fly before we’d fly.’ he was suggesting that meticulously rehearsing the way he and his team wanted the mission to unfold in the theater of his imagination set them up to execute that vision of mastery in reality, flawlessly. your mindset is an enormously potent tool for private greatness, prodigious productivity and creative victory—along with your heartset, healthset and soulset. i’ll teach you all about these remarkable concepts if you accept my invitation. anyhoo, back to why i closed my eyes. nearly every morning, i envision my ideal performance for the day ahead. i also reach deep into my emotions so i feel what it will feel like when i achieve the wins i’ve planned to accomplish. i lock"

i’ve yet to see a moving truck following a hearse on its way to a funeral.” he chuckled. the two listeners grinned. “he’s a treasure,” whispered the entrepreneur. “def is,” acknowledged the artist. “stop saying ‘def’ so much,” said the entrepreneur. “it’s getting irritating.” the artist looked a little shocked. “okay.” “all that matters on your last day on earth is the potential you’ve leveraged, the heroism you’ve demonstrated and the human lives you’ve graced,” the homeless man said eloquently. he then grew quiet. and let out a deep breath. “anyhoo. incredible that you’re coming. we’ll have a cool hang.” “may i bring my paintbrushes?” the artist asked politely. “only if you want to paint in paradise,” came the homeless man’s reply with a wink. “and what time should we meet you outside this place tomorrow morning?” asked the entrepreneur, placing her handbag onto a thin, bony shoulder. “ am ,” instructed the homeless man. “own your morning. elevate your life.” then, he disappeared. oceanofpdf.com c hapter a flight to peak productivity, virtuosity and undefeatability “your time is limited, so don’t waste it living"

hope you’re awesome. didn’t mean to spook you both yesterday. i just needed to keep my boots on the ground. epictetus, one of my favorite philosophers, wrote: “but neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training and prepare himself and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him.” voluntary discomfort, whether by dressing as i did or by fasting once a week or by sleeping on the floor once a month, keeps me strong, disciplined and focused on the central few priorities my life’s built around. anyhoo, have a tremendous flight, and i’ll see you in paradise soon. big hug. the driver continued, “please remember that appearances can be misleading and clothing doesn’t convey one’s character. yesterday you met a great man. looks really do not reveal the quality of a person.” “i guess neither does shaving,” proclaimed the artist, kicking a black boot against the shiny rolls-royce symbol at the center of one of the wheels. “mr. riley would never tell you what i’m about to tell you as he’s far too courteous and decent. but the gentleman you refer to as a ‘derelict’ happens to be one of the wealthiest people in the world.” “are you serious?” asked the entrepreneur, her eyes widening. “i most certainly am.” the driver smiled politely as he opened a door, waving a white-gloved hand to welcome both passengers into the vehicle. the seats had that marvelously musky smell of new leather. the wood paneling seemed like it had been prepared by hand, by a small family of finicky craftspeople who’d built their reputations around this singular obsession. “mr. riley made his fortune many years ago, in various commercial ventures. he was also an early investor in what has now become an internationally admired company. discretion prevents me from mentioning the name and, if mr. riley found out i was speaking"

i’ve always wanted to go to that island, and i’ve read a bit about it. it’s a high-frequency place. french flavor. tremendous beauty. and, from what they say, many of the warmest and happiest people on earth live there.” “i’m blown away, too,” the entrepreneur said as she sipped her coffee and peeked into the cockpit. she studied the pilots as they performed their pre-flight preparation. “i’ve also heard mauritius is splendid, and that the people are super-friendly, helpful and spiritually advanced.” after a perfect takeoff, the first-class plane floated high into the clouds. once at cruising altitude, premium champagne was served, caviar was recommended and an array of fabulous main courses were suggested. the entrepreneur was feeling fairly content and far less incited by the cruel attempt of her investors to take her company away from her. true, this might not be the ideal time to take a vacation to learn about the am club philosophy and its underlying methodology that had served mr. riley’s ascent to business titan and global philanthropist like rocket fuel. or perhaps this was the perfect time to get away from her usual reality to discover how the most successful, influential and joyful people on the planet start their days. after sipping on some champagne, the entrepreneur watched a movie. she then fell into a deep sleep. the artist had a book called michelangelo fiorentino et rafael da urbino: masters of art in the vatican. he read it for hours. you can just imagine how happy he felt. the jet made its trajectory over a number of vast continents and above varied terrain. the flight was meticulously conducted, and the landing was as fluid as the overall experience was fine. “bienvenue au île maurice,” announced the captain over the public address system as the aircraft taxied along the freshly paved runway. “merci beaucoup. welcome to mauritius and sir seewoosagur ramgoolam international airport,” he continued, speaking his words with the well-earned confidence of someone who had spent most of his life in the sky. “it’s been a privilege having you two vips with us. we’ll see you again in several days, from what mr. riley’s personal assistant has informed us of your itinerary. thank you once again for flying with us, and we trust that the journey was elegant, excellent and above all else, safe.” a polished black suv glittered on the tarmac as the flight attendant escorted her special passengers off the plane and into the humming vehicle. “your luggage will follow shortly. not to worry—it shall be delivered to your guest rooms at mr. riley’s seaside estate. spasiba,” she added in a graceful tone and with an earnest wave. “this is"
sharma,"so a-list,” observed the entrepreneur as she happily snapped some selfies, uncharacteristically pouting like a fashionista. “def,” replied the artist, as he photobombed her, sticking out his tongue like albert einstein did in that famous photo that betrayed his seriousness as a scientist and revealed his undiminished childlike sense of wonder. as the range rover rolled along the highway, tall stalks of sugar cane swayed in the fragrant breezes blown by the indian ocean. the quiet chauffeur wore a white cap, the kind you see bellmen at five-star hotels wearing, and a well-pressed dark gray uniform that hinted at an understated yet refined professionalism. he never missed slowing down when the speed limit descended and ensuring his signal light was on whenever a turn was to be made. though it was evident that the man was older, he moved the vehicle along the roadway with the precision of a young apprentice dedicated to becoming the absolute best. through the drive, his focus remained transfixed on the pavement ahead, in a sort of trance designed to keep his passengers secure yet deliver them to their destination with a smooth efficiency. they passed through some tiny villages that had a timeless feel. bougainvillea lined the streets, wild dogs with king-of-the-road demeanors stood at the meridian line, confronting the suv in a deadly game of chicken, and children played on small grassy lawns with thoughtless abandon. roosters could be heard shrieking from time to time, and old men in basic woolen hats with tooth-missing mouths and chestnut-colored skin sat on weather-beaten wooden chairs. they looked like they had too many hours to pass in the day, at once tired from life’s hardships and yet wise from days fully lived. choirs of upbeat birds sang melodically while colorful butterflies seemed to be fluttering everywhere. in one tiny community the suv snaked through, a skinny boy with legs that appeared too long for his body pedaled a banana bike with a seat that was set too high on its creaky metal frame. in another, a group of teenaged girls in tank tops, surf shorts and flip-flops shuffled along the narrow but attentively maintained road, following a man in army green cargo shorts wearing a t-shirt that had “the no. flame-grilled chicken” printed on the back of it. everything seemed to move on island time. people looked cheerful. they beamed with a radiant vitality not so commonly seen in the overscheduled, machine-dominated and sometimes soulless lives so many among us are experiencing. the beaches were unspeakably beautiful. the gardens were entirely glorious. and the entire gauguin-looking scene was draped by a series of mountains that looked like they’d been carved by a sixteenth-century florentine sculptor. “see that structure up there?” the driver said, breaking his self-imposed silence and pointing to a rock formation at the top of one of the peaks that resembled a human figure. “that’s called pieter both. it’s the second-highest mountain in mauritius. see the summit up there? it resembles a human head, right?” he noted with a finger pointed upward at the structure. “it definitely does,” responded the artist. “when we were in elementary school,” the chauffeur continued, “we were told the story of a man who fell asleep at the foot of the mountain. hearing strange sounds, he woke up to see fairies and angels dancing all about him. these creatures instructed the man never to tell anyone what he had just seen or he would be turned to stone. he agreed but then, given his excitement over the mystical experience he’d witnessed, broke his commitment and told many of his good fortune. upset, the fairies and angels turned him to rock. and his head swelled to such a degree it rose to sit at the peak of the majestic mountain you both are looking at now, reminding everyone who sees it to keep their promises. and honor their word.” the suv meandered past another community. music played from a small loudspeaker on a front porch as two teenaged boys and three teenaged girls with white and pink flowers in their hair danced gleefully. another dog barked modestly in the background. “great story,” noted the entrepreneur. her window was open, and her wavy brown hair flitted in the wind. her usually lined face now appeared completely smooth. she enunciated her words more slowly now. an unprecedented peacefulness emerged from her voice. one of her hands rested on the seat—not so far from where a hand of the artist, which bore finely etched tattoos on its middle and index fingers, lay. “mark twain wrote, ‘mauritius was made first, and then heaven; and heaven copied mauritius,’” the driver shared, now warming up after being somewhat steely. he beamed as proudly as a president on inauguration day after saying what he’d just said. “never seen anything like this,” the artist said, his goth-meets-angry-man hostility now replaced with a more untroubled, carefree and relaxed demeanor. “and the vibe i feel here is stirring something deeply creative inside of me.” the entrepreneur glanced at the artist for a little longer than was politely acceptable. then she looked away, out at the sea. though reluctant, she couldn’t help but smile gently. the driver could be heard whispering into the suv’s speakerphone, “five minutes away.” then he handed each of his passengers a handcrafted tablet that seemed made of gold. “please study these,” he told them. engraved, finely, in the apparently precious metal were five statements. here’s what the tablets looked like: rule # an addiction to distraction is the end of your creative production. empire-makers and history-creators take one hour for themselves before dawn, in the serenity that lies beyond the clutches of complexity, to prepare themselves for a world-class day. rule # excuses breed no genius. just because you haven’t installed the early-rising habit before doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. release your rationalizations and remember that small daily improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results. rule # all change is hard"

he’s just hanging out by the water, soaking up those rays and totally lovin’ life. told you he’s special. so happy i trusted my gut and agreed to this wonderful escapade. he’s been true to his word, in a world where too many people say things they never do and make promises they fail to keep. he’s been super-consistent. he’s treated us so well. he doesn’t even know us, and yet he’s really trying to help us. zero doubt in my mind he’s got our backs. hurry up, will you,” she urged her slow-moving companion as she waved an encouraging hand. “i feel like giving mr. riley a giant hug!” the artist laughed as a baby gecko jaywalked across a broad plank. he took off his black shirt in the dazzling sunshine, exposing a buddha-sized belly and man breasts the size of fleshy mangoes. “me, too. he does walk his preach. man, i need to get some sun,” the painter murmured as he sped up to stay close to the entrepreneur. he breathed hard. as the two guests walked toward the man at the water’s edge of this nirvana of an ocean compound, they observed there were no other houses in sight. not even one. just a few wooden fishing boats with paint peeled off from the passage of years moored in the shallow waters near the shore. and aside from the sun worshipping empire-builder in italian shades, there was no other human being in evidence. anywhere. “mr. riley,” shouted the artist, now on the sand hungrily sucking air into his extraordinarily unfit lungs. the slender figure remained as fixed as a palace guard awaiting the arrival of the royal motorcade. “mr. riley,” echoed the entrepreneur passionately. no response. the man just kept looking out at the sea and at container ships the size of football stadiums that sat sprinkled across the horizon. the artist soon stood behind the set of intensely tanned shoulders of the figure and tapped three times on the left one. instantly, the figure spun around. the two visitors gasped. the entrepreneur put a slender hand over her mouth. the artist jerked backward, instinctively, before falling to the sand. both were stunned by what they saw. it was the spellbinder. oceanofpdf.com c hapter preparation"
sharma,"for a transformation begins in paradise “a child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. it’s only you and i, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate.” —steven pressfield “um. wow!” declared the entrepreneur with a crooked smile that displayed part surprise and part delight. “we were at your seminar. um. you were brilliant up on that stage,” she finally managed to express, pivoting impressively from soft shock to the master-of-the-universe business bearing she was more accustomed to. “i lead a technology company. we’re what pundits in our industry call ‘a rocket ship’ because of the exponential growth we’ve been experiencing. things were going phenomenally well until a little while ago …” the entrepreneur’s voice trailed off. she looked away from the spellbinder and stared at the artist. for a moment she played nervously with her bracelets. the lines along her face became more vivid. and her visage gave off a heavy, tired and injured look in that instant, on that spectacular beach. “what happened?” asked the spellbinder. “to your business?” “some of the people who invested in my enterprise felt i had too much equity in it. they wanted more for themselves. super-greedy people. so, they manipulated my executive team, convinced key employees to rally against me and are now trying to throw me out of the firm. that place is my whole life.” the entrepreneur choked up. a school of luxuriously colored tropical fish swam through the shallow water at the edge of the sand. “i was ready to take my life,” she carried on. “until i showed up at your seminar. many of your nuggets of knowledge gave me hope. a lot of your words made me feel strong again. not sure exactly what it was, but you pushed me to believe in myself and my future. i just want to thank you.” she embraced the spellbinder. “you’ve started me on the journey to optimizing my life.” “thank you so much for your generous words,” the spellbinder replied, appearing dramatically different from the way he looked the last time the entrepreneur and the artist saw him. not only did he have that healthy glow people get from time in the sun, he now stood steadily and had gained a little weight. “i’m grateful for what you’ve said,” the spellbinder continued. “but the truth is that i didn’t start you on the quest to improve your life. you are changing your life by starting the process of bringing application to my insights and methods—by implementing my teachings. so many people chat a good game. they tell you all the ambitions they’re going to get done and all the aspirations they plan to deliver on. i’m not judging. i’m just reporting. i’m not complaining, i’m just saying: most people stay the same their entire lives. too frightened to leave the way they operated yesterday. married to the complacency of the ordinary and wedded to the shackles of conformity while resisting all opportunity for growth, evolution and personal elevation. so many good souls among us are just so scared they refuse the call on their lives to go out into the blue ocean of possibility where mastery, the dignity of bravery and the authenticity of audacity await them. you had the wisdom to act on some of the information i shared at my event. you’re one in a tiny minority of people alive today willing to do what it takes to become a better leader, producer and human being. good on you. and i know transformation isn’t an easy play. yet, the life of the caterpillar must end for the glory of the butterfly to shine. the old ‘you’ must die before the best ‘you’ can be born. you’re so smart not to wait until you have ideal conditions to step up to a work world and private life of stainless excellence. great power is unleashed with a simple start. when you begin to close the loop opened by your utmost aspirations by making them real, a secret heroic force within you makes itself known. nature notices your effortful actions and then goes ahead and replies to your faithful commitment with a series of unanticipated wins. your willpower heightens. your confidence climbs. and your brilliance soars. a year from now, you’ll be so happy you began today.” “thank you,” said the entrepreneur. “i heard a man say he needed to lose weight before he could start running. imagine that. lose the weight so he could initiate the running habit. that’s like a writer who waits for inspiration to begin the book, or the manager who waits for a promotion to lead the field, or a startup that waits for full funding before launching a status quo–disrupting product. the flow of life rewards positive action and punishes hesitation. anyway, i’m thrilled i could contribute to your rise, in some small way. sounds like you’re at a difficult yet exciting time on your personal adventure. please consider that a bad day for the ego is a great day for the soul. and what your voice of fear claims is a mean season the light of your wisdom knows is a splendid gift.” “we thought you were dead,” the entrepreneur announced, unfiltered. “thank god you’re okay. and i appreciate how humble you are.” “i believe the humblest is the greatest. pure leaders are so secure in their own skin their main mission is the elevation of others. they have such self-respect, joyfulness and peacefulness within themselves that they don’t need to advertise their success to society in a feeble attempt to feel a little better. i should also say, if i may, that there’s a big difference between real power and fake power,” the spellbinder explained, dropping even deeper into the guru mode that had made him so famous worldwide. “our culture tells us to pursue titles and trinkets, applause and acclaim, money and mansions. all that’s fine—it truly is—so"
sharma,"long as you don’t get brainwashed into defining your worth as a human being by these things. enjoy them, just don’t get attached to them. have them, just don’t base your identity around them. appreciate them, just don’t need them. these are only forms of fake power our civilization programs us to believe we must pursue to be successful—and serene. the fact is that should you lose any one of these things, the substitute power you derived from them evaporates. just vanishes in an instant, revealing itself as the illusion it was.” “tell us more, please.” the entrepreneur was absorbing every word. “real power never comes from anything external,” the spellbinder continued. “a lot of people with a lot of money aren’t very wealthy. take that line to the bank,” stated the spellbinder as he slipped off his bright yellow flip-flops and placed them neatly on the sugary sand. “genuine power—the stuff legends are made of—doesn’t arise from who you are outside and what you possess externally. the world is lost right now. true and enduring power expresses itself when you contact your original gifts and realize your most lavish talents as a human. i should also say real riches come from living by the noble virtues of productivity, self-discipline, courage, honesty, empathy and integrity as well as being able to lead your days on your own terms versus blindly following the sheep that so many in our sick society have been trained to become. ‘sheeple’ is what too many people now are. the excellent news is that this kind of power i speak of is available to anyone alive on the planet today. we might have forgotten and disowned this form of potency we have as life has hurt, disappointed and confused us. but it’s still there waiting for us to build a relationship with it. and develop it. all of the great teachers of history owned very few things, you know. when mahatma gandhi died he had about ten possessions, including his sandals, a watch, his eyeglasses and a simple bowl to eat from. mother teresa, so prosperous of heart and rich with the authentic power to influence millions, died in a tiny room containing almost no worldly goods. when she’d travel, she’d carry all her things in a white cloth bag.” “why do so many of the heroes of humanity have so little?” asked the artist, now relaxing on the sand. “because they’ve reached a level of individual maturity that allowed them to see the futility of spending their days chasing objects that count for nothing at the end. and they had cultivated their characters to such a degree that they no longer had the common need of most to fill the holes within themselves with distractions, attractions, escapes and luxuries. the more their appetite for superficial possessions dematerialized, the more hungry they became for substantial pursuits like honoring their creative vision, expressing their inherent genius and living by a higher moral blueprint. they viscerally understood that being inspirational and masterful and fearless are all inside jobs. and once true power is accessed, external substitutes pale in comparison to the feelings of fulfillment this treasure provides. oh, and these heavyweights of history, as they discovered their supreme natures, also came to realize that one of the primary aims of a wonderfully crafted life is contribution. impact. usefulness. helpfulness. what business-builders might call ‘unlocking stakeholder value.’ like i suggested at my seminar before i fell, ‘to lead is to serve.’ the philosopher rumi made the point much more brilliantly than i ever could when he observed, ‘give up the drop, become the ocean.’” “thanks for sharing,” offered the entrepreneur sincerely, sitting down next to the artist on the sand and placing one of her hands carefully only a short distance away from one of his. “it’s good to see you’re doing better,” mentioned the artist, his boots now off. he was sockless. as he basked in the strong rays like a sunbathing cat he asked, “what the heck happened to you anyway?” “exhaustion,” confided the spellbinder. “too many cities. too many airplanes. too many media appearances. too many presentations. i just ground myself down in pursuit of my mission to help people accelerate their leadership, activate their gifts and become heroes of their lives. i know better.” the spellbinder then pulled off his sleek sunglasses and extended a hand to his two students. “it’s a great pleasure to meet you both.” “you too, brother,” the artist replied. “your work has helped me make it through some tough times.” as the artist spoke these words, he spotted a catamaran overflowing with festively dressed tourists whizzing along in the distance. another school of fish, called capitaines, could be observed swimming busily in the clear water. the spellbinder spied them, smiled broadly and then continued. “you must be wondering why i’m here,” he stated. “true,” said the entrepreneur as she took off her shoes and twisted her feet into the white sand alongside her companion. “well, i’ve been advising mr. riley since he was a thirty-three-year-old man. all pro athletes have peak performance coaches, and so do all extraordinary businesspeople. you just can’t get to iconic alone. he was starting out when we met, but even then he understood that the more one learns, the more one can achieve. growth is the real sport that the best play, every day. education truly is inoculation against disruption. and as you become better you will have better, within all arenas of your life. i call this the x x mindset : to double your income and impact, triple your investment in two core areas—your personal mastery and your professional capability.” “love it,” the artist said as he scratched his flabby belly. then he picked at a decrepit toenail. “mr. riley understood, early on, that to rise to world-class, you need world-class support. we’ve become fantastic friends over the years. we’ve shared tremendous joys together, like five-hour-long lunches with palm heart salad, fresh grilled"
sharma,"prawns and excellent french wine here on this private beach of his.” the spellbinder stretched his arms into the air. he looked over at the mighty mountains. he remained silent for a few moments. “and we’ve experienced deep sorrows together as well, like the time my buddy got sick with cancer just after his fiftieth birthday. he appeared to have everything a man could desire. but without his good health, he realized he had nothing. that one changed him. health is the crown on the well person’s head that only the ill person can see, you know? or, as one tradition says, when we are young we sacrifice our health for wealth and when we grow old and wise we realize what’s most important—and become willing to sacrifice all our wealth for even one day of good health. you never want to be the richest person in the graveyard, you know. “he beat it, though,” the spellbinder quickly added, staring at the noisy tourists partying on the catamaran. “just like he defends himself against everything that tries to defeat his dreams. stone’s an amazing guy. i love him like a brother. “well, look, it really has been good to meet you both,” the spellbinder continued. “i heard you were coming. mr. riley’s tremendously excited to share what he promised he’d share with you about reaching maximum productivity, sustaining exceptional performance and creating a life you love by coding in a superior morning routine. i’m pleased he’s paying it forward and sharing what i, as his mentor, taught him. you’ll love all the insights and learning models that will soon be coming your way. the am club will be revolutionary for you both. i know it sounds strange and unbelievable, but being exposed to the methodology stone is about to teach you will cause outstanding shifts deep within you. just being around the information will awaken something special in you.” the spellbinder put on his chic sunglasses. “anyway, mr. riley asked me to tell you to make yourselves at home here over the next few days. you won’t see a lot of me because i’ll be snorkeling, sailing and fishing most of the time. fishing is one of the things i most love to do in life. i come down to mauritius not only to coach the great and kind soul you’ll soon meet, i show up here to regenerate and get away from this overcomplicated world of ours, flush with so many difficulties, damaged economies, saturated industries and environmental decays, just to mention a few of the factors that threaten to bring down our creativity, energy, performance and happiness. i show up here to renew and refuel. elite production without quiet vacation causes lasting depletion. rest and recovery isn’t a luxury for anyone committed to mastery—it’s a necessity. i’ve taught that principle for many years—yet i forgot it myself, and paid the price at the event. i’ve also learned that inspiration gets fed by isolation, away from the ceaseless digital diversion and mindless overcommunication that dominates the hours of the majority these days. and, know too that your natural genius presents itself when you’re most joyful. we get our ideas that change the world when we’re rested, relaxed and filled with delight. this tiny spot in the indian ocean helps me reaccess my best. it’s also a genuine sanctuary of safety, staggering beauty and awesome gastronomy, with affectionate people who still wear their hearts on their sleeves. i just adore the mauritians. most still have an appreciation for the wonders of life’s simplest pleasures. like family meals or swimming with friends, followed by sharing a roast chicken dinner purchased from the super u, washed down with an ice cold can of phoenix.” “phoenix?” asked the artist. “it’s the beer of mauritius,” replied the spellbinder. “and i must say that i always leave the island one hundred times stronger, faster, centered and fired up. i really work hard in my everyday life. i hope this doesn’t sound like vanity, but i care so much about uplifting society and am so committed to doing my part to reduce the greed, hatred and conflict in it. coming here remakes me. reconnects me to what’s important. so i can go back and work for the world. we all work for the world, you know? anyway, you two have fun, okay? and thanks again for coming to my seminar and for your positive words. they mean more to me than you could ever know. anyone can be a critic. takes guts to be an encourager. being a high-impact leader never requires being a disrespectful person. i wish more leaders understood this principle. “oh, one last thing,” the spellbinder added as he flicked some sand off his camouflage-patterned surf shorts. “what?” asked the entrepreneur in a respectful tone. “please be here on the beach tomorrow morning. your training will begin then.” “sure,” agreed the entrepreneur. “what time?” “ am ,” came the reply. “own your morning. elevate your life.” oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am method: the morning routine of world-builders “it is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth and wisdom.” —aristotle “welcome to the am club!” the billionaire bellowed as he bounded down the steps from his seaside home. “bonzour! that’s creole for ‘good morning.’ you’re right on time! i love it! punctuality is the trait of royalty. at least it is in my playbook. stone riley’s my name,” he declared as he graciously extended a hand to greet his two guests. the tattered old clothes had been replaced with a black pair of trimly cut running shorts and a pristine white t-shirt with the line “no idea works until you do the work” emblazoned on it. he was barefoot and cleanly shaven, seemed extremely fit and sported a wonderful suntan, all of which made him look many years younger than he had appeared at the seminar. on his head he wore a black baseball cap, turned backward. his"
sharma,"green eyes were still uncommonly clear. and his smile was astonishingly radiant. yes, there was something exceedingly special about this man, as the entrepreneur had sensed. a white dove hovered over the tycoon, floating in the air for about ten seconds as if suspended by magic. then it flew off. can you imagine this? it was a miraculous thing to see. “let me give you two a hug, if you don’t mind,” the billionaire enthused, wrapping his long arms around the entrepreneur and the artist at the same time, without waiting for a reply. “god, you have courage. yes, you do,” he mused. “you trusted a disheveled old man. a total stranger. i know i looked like a vagrant the other day. hey, it’s not that i don’t care about how i look. i just don’t care that much about how i look,” he said as he laughed at his own lack of self-consciousness. “i just like to keep things real. nice and simple. completely authentic. makes me think of that old insight: having lots of money doesn’t make you different. it just makes you more of who you were before you made the cash.” the billionaire peered out into the ocean and allowed the early rays of a fresh dawn to wash over him. he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. the contours of his chiseled abdominal muscles were noticeable through his t-shirt. next, he pulled a flower from the back pocket of his black shorts. neither the entrepreneur nor the artist had ever seen a flower like this one. and it wasn’t at all damaged from being in the billionaire’s pocket. strange. “flowers are very important to anyone serious about creating magic in their work and private lives,” spoke the mogul as he sniffed the petals. “anyhoo, i wanted to mention that my father was a farmer. i grew up on a farm, before we moved to southern california. we thought simple, spoke simple, ate simple and lived simple. you can take the boy out of the country, you know, but you can’t take the country out of the boy,” he added, expressing an enthusiasm that was contagious while his sights were riveted on the magnificent sea. the entrepreneur and the artist thanked the billionaire profusely. they explained that their adventure so far had been phenomenal and mentioned sincerely that the island and his exclusive beach were more beautiful than anything they had previously seen. “utopia, isn’t it?” said the billionaire as he put on his sunglasses. “i am blessed, that’s for sure. i’m so glad you cats are here.” “so, was it your father who got you into the habit of getting up with the sun?” asked the artist as they strolled along the water’s edge. a tiny crab raced by while three butterflies ascended above. stunningly, the billionaire started twirling around like a whirling dervish. while he spun, he began to shout these words: “i would have it inscribed on the curtains of your chamber: ‘if you do not rise early you can make progress in nothing!’” “um, what are you doing?” questioned the entrepreneur. “it’s an excellent quote from william pitt, the earl of chatham. for some reason i just felt the need to share it right now. anyhoo, let me answer the question about my father,” the billionaire said awkwardly. “yes and no. i watched him rise early every morning of my childhood. as with any good routine, he did it so many times that it became impossible for him not to do it. but like most kids, i resisted what my dad wanted me to do. i always had some form of rebel within me. i’m a bit of a pirate in a way. rather than fight a small war with me every day, for whatever reason, he just let me do what i wanted to do. so, i’d sleep. late.” “cool father,” spoke the entrepreneur, who was dressed in yoga gear this morning and carried her device with her to take careful notes. “he was,” affirmed the billionaire, warmly putting his arms around his students as they continued to walk slowly along the pristine beach. mr. riley continued. “it was actually the spellbinder who taught me the am method. i was a young man when i first met him. i’d just launched my first company. i needed someone to guide me, challenge me and develop me as an entrepreneur, a peak achiever and as a leader. everyone said he was the best executive coach in the world, by far. he had a three-year waiting list. so, i called him every day until he agreed to become my mentor. he was pretty young back then, too. but his teachings had a depth of wisdom, a purity of power and an ingenious impact that was remarkably advanced for his age.” “and the early-rising discipline helped?” the artist broke in. the billionaire smiled at the artist. and stopped walking. “ it was the one practice that changed—and elevated—every other practice . researchers now call this kind of a core behavior that multiplies all your other regular patterns of performing ‘a keystone habit.’ wiring it in as a profound neural pathway took some effort, a little suffering along the way and the strongest commitment i had in me. i’ll be honest with you, there were days during the process of automating this routine that i was cranky, days when my head pounded like a jackhammer and mornings when i just wanted to keep sleeping. but once i locked and loaded getting up at am regularly, my days grew consistently—and vastly—better than anything i’ve ever experienced.” “how?” both listeners wondered aloud, in unison. the entrepreneur touched one of her fingers on the artist’s arm affectionately, as if to suggest they were together in this experience, that they were now a team and that she had his best interests at heart. the artist locked his eyes onto hers. a gentle grin emerged. the billionaire went on: “in this"
sharma,"time of exponential change, overwhelming distractions and overflowing schedules, getting up at am and running the morning regime the spellbinder taught me was my antidote to average. no more rushing in my morning! imagine what that alone does for the quality of your day. starting your day luxuriating in the quietude only the early morning provides. beginning your day feeling strong and centered and free. i found that my mind became dramatically more focused as the days progressed. every great performer, whether we’re talking about a championship athlete, a top-tier executive, a celebrated architect or a revered cellist, has developed the ability to concentrate on optimizing their particular skill for long, uninterrupted periods of time. this capability is one of the special factors that allows them to generate such high-quality results in a world where too many people dilute their cognitive bandwidth and fragment their attention, accepting poor performances and ordinary achievements while leading lives of disappointing mediocrity.” “i definitely agree,” indicated the artist. “it’s rare to see someone focus on their art for many, many hours in a row these days. the spellbinder was right when at his session he called people addicted to their devices ‘cyber zombies.’ i see them every day. it’s like they’re not real human beings anymore. more like robots, glued to their screens. not present. and half-alive to life.” “i hear you,” said the billionaire. “protection from distraction is precisely how you need to work if you’re serious about dominating your field and winning at your craft. neuroscientists call this peak mental state we’re speaking of, where our perception becomes heightened and our availability to original ideas rises and we access an all-new level of processing power, ‘flow.’ and rising at am promotes the flow state gorgeously. oh—and by getting up at before daybreak, while almost everyone around you is asleep—my creativity also soared, my energy definitely doubled, my productivity surely tripled, my …” “you’re serious?” the entrepreneur interrupted, unable to contain her fascination with the idea that a simple shift toward a bespoke morning routine could reorder a human life so completely. “absolutely. honesty has been one of my core convictions for all my years in business. nothing beats going to sleep early each night with an unspoiled conscience and a mess-free heart. that’s part of my farm boy nature, i guess,” observed the billionaire. abruptly, the entrepreneur’s phone signaled the arrival of an urgent incoming message. “so sorry. i told my team not to call me here. i was clear with them. i can’t imagine why they’re bothering me now,” she said as she looked down at the screen. in all caps, the following stark words appeared: leave the company. or else you die. the entrepreneur fumbled with her phone. then she accidentally dropped it into the sand. soon she was gasping for air. “what happened?” the artist asked quickly, sensing trouble. seeing the blood wash out of his friend’s face and her hands trembling, he repeated with greater intensity and even higher empathy, “what happened?” the billionaire also appeared concerned. “are you okay? do you need some water or something?” “i just received a death threat. from … um … my … investors. they want my firm. they are … um … trying to kick me out because they think i have too big a share. they just told me that if i don’t walk away they’ll—um—kill me.” instantly, the billionaire ripped off the sunglasses he was sporting and held them in the air, making a circling movement. seconds later, from behind a flourish of palm trees, two large men with earpieces and rifles sprinted down to the beachfront as fast as a cyclist on steroids. “boss, you all right?” the tallest of the two big men asked tensely. “yes,” came the confident and calm reply to his security detail. “but i need you two to check this out immediately—if it’s cool for me to do this for you,” he said as he looked at the entrepreneur. “i can help you make this go away.” the billionaire then muttered something to himself. and a flight of doves soared by. “sure. yes. i’d appreciate some help,” the businesswoman replied, her voice still shaking and pearls of perspiration appearing on her forehead, in the area where all those creases were. “leave this with us,” declared the billionaire. he then spoke to his protection people, politely yet with an undeniable air of authority. “seems my guest here is being seriously harassed by some thugs hoping to take over her enterprise. please figure out exactly what they’re up to and then present me with your solution.” “don’t worry,” he told the entrepreneur. “my guys are the best in the business. this won’t be a problem .” mr. riley articulated this last sentence in a fashion that emphasized each word, for powerful effect. “thank you very much,” the entrepreneur responded, looking enormously relieved. the artist held her hand tenderly. “okay if i continue?” the billionaire requested as the sun rose higher into the glamorous tropical sky. his guests nodded. an attendant, impeccably attired, emerged from a hut that sat higher up on the beach. it was painted green with white trim. soon, the aide was serving the richest, most delicious coffee the entrepreneur and the artist had enjoyed in their lives. “fantastic cognitive enhancer when consumed in moderation each morning,” expounded the billionaire as he sipped away. “and it’s packed with antioxidants, so coffee also slows aging. “anyhoo—where were we? i was telling you about the awesome benefit that flowed to me after i joined the am club and ran the morning methodology the spellbinder revealed to me. it’s called the // formula and, trust me, once you learn this concept alone and then apply it with persistency, your productivity, prosperity, performance and impact will increase exponentially. i can’t think of another ritual that has contributed to my success and well-being as much. i’m exceedingly low-key about what i’ve been able to accomplish in my business"
sharma,"career. i’ve always viewed bragging as a major defect of character. the more powerful a person truly is, the less they need to promote it. and the stronger a leader is, the less they need to announce it.” “the spellbinder spoke a bit about what you’ve been able to achieve,” offered the entrepreneur, now looking even more relaxed. “and the wild way you dressed at the conference definitely confirmed it!” interjected the artist, flashing a sensational smile that showcased a few broken teeth. “rising at am every morning was the main personal practice that made most of that happen. allowed me to become a visionary thinker. gave me a reflective space to develop a formidable inner life. the discipline helped me to become ultra-fit, with all the beautiful income advancements as well as lifestyle enhancements that come with superior health. early rising also made me a pretty amazing leader. and it helped me grow myself into a much better person. even when the prostate cancer tried to devastate me, it was my morning routine that insulated me. it really was. i’ll go into the // formula in an upcoming lesson so you’ll know exactly what to do to get amazing results from the first moment you wake up. you cats won’t believe the power and value of the information that’s coming. i’m so excited for you two. welcome to paradise. and welcome to the first day of a substantially better life.” the entrepreneur slept more soundly that night in mauritius than she had in years. despite the threat she had received, the combination of the billionaire’s brief instruction, the magnificence of the natural setting, the purity of the clean ocean air and her growing fondness for the artist caused her to let go of many of her concerns. and rediscover a state of calm she’d long since forgotten. then, at precisely : am , she heard a thunderous bang on her door. she knew it was this time because she glanced at the alarm clock on the wooden night table in the stylish guesthouse her host had arranged for her to stay in. the entrepreneur assumed it was the artist, perhaps dealing with jet lag or sleepless after the excellent yet large dinner they had enjoyed together. without asking who it was, she opened the door. no one was there. “hello?” she announced to a star-filled sky. waves softly collided with the seashore near her cottage, and the scents of roses, incense and sandalwood could be detected in the breeze. “anyone here?” silence. the entrepreneur carefully shut the door. this time, she bolted the lock. as she shuffled back to her bed that was covered with egyptian cottons and english linens, three mighty knocks pounded on the door. “yes?” cried the entrepreneur, now alarmed. “yes?” “we have the morning coffee you ordered, madam,” a husky voice replied. the entrepreneur’s face was crowded by crevices again. her heart began to thump vigorously. she grew deeply distressed, and her stomach filled with knots as humungous as the alps. “they’re bringing me coffee at this nutso hour? unbelievable.” she returned to the front of the guest house, undid the lock and opened the front door, haltingly. a stocky man with a disagreeable bald head and one eye that seemed out of joint stood there, smirking. he wore a red windbreaker and denim shorts that dropped just below his knees. around his neck was a thin piece of blue string. dangling from it was a plastic-laminated photo of a person’s face. the entrepreneur squinted to see the face more clearly in the darkness. and as she did, she saw the image of an older man. one she knew very well. one she loved very much. one she missed considerably. the picture in the plastic she was studying was of her dead father. “who are you?” screamed the terrified entrepreneur. “how did you get this photo?” “i’ve been sent by your business partners. we know everything there is to know about you. everything. we’ve tracked all your personal data. we’ve hacked all your files. we’ve investigated your entire history.” the bald man in the windbreaker reached under the front of his belt—and pulled out a knife, bringing it to within a few inches of the entrepreneur’s thin and particularly veiny throat. “no one can protect you now. we have an entire team focused on you. i’m not going to hurt you … yet. this time’s just about me making a point. giving you an in-person message … leave your company. give up your equity. and say bye-bye. or you get this blade in your neck. when you least expect it … when you think you’re safe. maybe with that chubby painter friend of yours …” the man pulled the knife away and replaced it under his belt. “have a good night, madam. it’s been a pleasure meeting you. i know we’ll see each other soon.” then he reached forward and pulled the door shut with a slam. the entrepreneur, badly shaken, fell to her knees. “please, god. help me. i can’t take this anymore! i don’t want to die.” three more strikes came to the door. these ones were gentler. “hey, it’s me. please open the door.” the knocking startled the entrepreneur. and woke her up. the tapping continued. she opened her eyes, peered around the lightless room—and realized she’d been caught in a bad dream. the businesswoman rose from her bed, shuffled across the wide-planked oak floor and opened the front door, knowing it was the artist after hearing his familiar voice. “i just had the most insane dream,” said the entrepreneur. “a brutal man showed up here, had a piece of plastic hanging from his neck with a photo of my dad in it and threatened to stab me with a knife if i didn’t give my firm over to the investors.” “you okay now?” the artist asked softly. “i’ll be fine.” “i had an unusual dream, too,” the artist explained. “i couldn’t"
sharma,"sleep after it. it’s got me thinking about so many things. the quality of my art. the depth of my belief system. the foolishness of my excuses. my cynical attitude. my aggressiveness. my self-sabotage and my endless procrastination. i’m analyzing my daily routines. and how i’ll spend the rest of my life. hey, you sure you’re okay?” the artist questioned, realizing he was talking a little too much about himself and not empathizing with his alarmed companion. “i’m fine. better now that you’re here.” “you sure?” “yes.” “i missed you,” the artist said. “do you mind if i tell you more about my dream?” “go ahead,” encouraged the entrepreneur. “well, i was a little kid, at school. and every day, i’d pretend i was two things: a giant and a pirate. all day long, i believed i had the strength of a giant and the rule-breaking swagger of a pirate. i told my teachers i was these two characters. and at home, i told my parents the same thing. my teachers laughed at me—and put me down, telling me to be more realistic, to behave more like the other kids and to stop all my ridiculous dreaming.” “what did your parents say? were they kinder to you?” asked the entrepreneur, now sitting on the sofa with her legs crossed in a yoga posture. “same as my teachers. they told me i wasn’t a giant. and that i definitely was no pirate. they reminded me that i was a little boy. and told me that if i didn’t limit my imagination, stifle my creativity and put an end to my fantasies, they’d punish me.” “so, what happened?” “i did what i was told to do. i caved in. i bought into the attitudes of the adults. i made myself tinier instead of grander, so i’d be a good boy. i suffocated my hopes, gifts and powers in an effort to conform—like most people do every single day of their lives. i’m starting to realize how much we’ve been hypnotized away from our brilliance and brainwashed out of our genius. the spellbinder and the billionaire are right.” “tell me more about your dream,” the entrepreneur urged. “i began to mold myself to the system. i started to become a follower. i no longer believed i was as powerful as a giant and as swashbuckling as a pirate. i sheepwalked with the flock, becoming like everybody else. eventually i grew into a man who spent money i didn’t have, buying things i didn’t need to impress people i didn’t like. what a poor way to live.” “i do some of that behavior too,” admitted the entrepreneur. “i’m learning so much about myself, thanks to this very weird and hugely useful voyage. i’m starting to realize how superficial i’ve been, how selfish i am and how many good things i actually have going for me in my life. many people in the world couldn’t even imagine experiencing all the blessings i have.” “got you,” said the artist. “so, in my dream, i became a bookkeeper. i married and had a family. i lived in a subdivision. and drove a good car. i had a fairly nice life. a few true friends. work that paid my mortgage, and a salary that handled my bills. but each day looked the same. gray versus vivid. boring instead of enchanting. as i got older, the children left home to live lives of their own. my body aged, and my energy fell. and, unfortunately, my wife in my dream passed away. as i grew even older, my eyesight began to fail, my hearing began to fade and my memory became extremely weak.” “this is making me feel sad,” voiced the entrepreneur, sounding vulnerable. “and when i got really old, i actually forgot where i lived, couldn’t remember my name and lost all sense of who i was in the community. but—get this—i began to remember who i truly was again.” “a giant. and a pirate. right?” “exactly!” replied the artist. “the dream made me understand that i can’t postpone doing amazing work anymore. that i can’t put off improving my health, my happiness, my confidence and even my love life.” “really?” wondered the entrepreneur wistfully. “really,” responded the artist. he then reached forward. and kissed her on the forehead. oceanofpdf.com c hapter a framework for the expression of greatness “the men who are great live with that which is substantial, they do not stay with that which is superficial; they abide with realities, they remain not with what is showy. the one they discard, the other they hold.” —lao tzu “hey, cats,” boomed the billionaire. “you’re right on time, as usual. nice work!” it was am and, while the retreating outline of the moon remained in the sky, the rays of a new dawn greeted the three human beings standing on the perfect beach. the perfumed ocean breeze swirled with notes of red hibiscus, clove and tuberose. a mauritius kestrel, the rarest falcon in the world, flew overhead, and a pink pigeon—the scarcest on the planet—minded its business near a lush cluster of palm trees. a family of geckos shot by on their way to someplace important and a giant aldabra tortoise crawled along a grassy bank above the shore. all this natural splendor elevated the joy and electrified the spirits of the three members of the am club who stood on the sand. the billionaire pointed to a bottle floating in the ocean. as he waved his finger from side to side, the bottle moved from side to side. when he twirled a digit, the bottle in the water swirled with it. and when he lifted a hand slowly, the bottle appeared to rise above the surface of the ocean. soon the container washed up onto the wet sand and it became clear that a swatch of silk had been rolled up inside of it. picture how mysterious all this seemed. “a message in a bottle,” declared the"
sharma,"billionaire happily. he started clapping his hands like a little tyke. he sure was an abnormal and totally wonderful character. “this conveniently sets the tone for my mentoring session with you this morning,” he added. the industrialist then lifted the vessel, unscrewed the cap and pulled out the fabric, which had the framework below stitched onto it: “this is one of the simplest yet gnarliest of the teaching models the spellbinder shared when he started coaching me as a young man,” explained the billionaire, using more of his surfer slang. “and it’ll provide the context for all the teachings that will follow. so, i really want you both to understand it intimately. at first glance, it seems like a really basic model. but as you integrate it over time, you’ll see how profound it is.” mr. riley then closed his eyes, covered his ears with his hands and recited these words: the beginning of transformation is the increase of perception. as you see more you can materialize more. and once you know better you can achieve bigger. the great women and men of the world—the ones responsible for the magical symphonies, the beautiful movements, the advancements of science and the progress of technology—started by reengineering their thinking and reinventing their awareness. in so doing, they entered a secret universe that the majority could not perceive. and this, in turn, allowed them to make the daily choices few choose to make. which, automatically, delivered the daily results few get to experience. the tycoon reopened his eyes. he raised an index finger to his lips, as if immersed in some splendidly weighty insight. looking intently at the framework embedded into the silk, he continued, “heroes, titans and icons all have a personal trait that average performers just don’t show, you know.” “which is?” asked the artist, who was dressed goofily in a muscle shirt and a speedo swimsuit. “rigor,” replied the billionaire. “the best in the world have depth. members of the majority often get stuck in a mindset of superficiality in their work. their whole approach is light. no real preparation. very little contemplation and then the setting of a towering vision for the desired outcome along with patiently considering the sequencing of executions that will result in an awesome result. the % of performers don’t invest painstaking attention into the tiniest of details and fail to refine the smallest of finishes like the great masters do. for most people the truth is that it’s all about the path of least resistance. getting what they need to get done fast and just sneaking by. mailing it in instead of bringing it on . the minority of exceptional creative achievers operate under a completely different philosophy.” “tell me,” appealed the artist, intrigued. “they apply a mentality of granularity instead of a mindset of superficiality. they have encoded depth as a lifetime value and exist under a profound insistence on greatness in all that they do. exceptionalists fully understand that their creative output—no matter if they are bricklayers or bakers, chief executive officers or dairy farmers, astronauts or cashiers—represents their reputation. the best, in any endeavor, appreciate the fact that your good name is branded onto every piece of work that you release. and they get that you can’t put a price tag on people saying superb things about you.” the billionaire rubbed the bottle. then he held it up and viewed the last evidence of the disappearing moon through its glass before continuing his discourse. “but it goes deeper than social approval,” the industrialist indicated. “the grade of work you offer to the world reflects the strength of the respect you have for yourself. those with unfathomable personal esteem wouldn’t dare send out anything average. it would diminish them too much. “if you want to lead your field,” mr. riley went on, “become a performer and person of depth,” he reinforced. “commit to being a highly unusual human being instead of one of those timid souls who behave like everyone else, living a sloppy life instead of a magnificent one, a derivative life instead of an original one.” “profound,” the artist contributed, showing great exuberance while taking off his muscle shirt to get some sun. “in their work, the maestros of mastery are extraordinarily thoughtful. they think precisely about what they are doing. they hold their labor to the highest of standards and sweat the smallest of strokes, like master sculptor gian lorenzo bernini did as he crafted fontana dei quattro fiumi —fountain of the four rivers—his masterpiece that sits gloriously in the center of piazza navona in rome. such producers are meticulous and craft at near-flawless. and, as obvious as this sounds, they just really, really, really care.” “but people have a lot to do in their days, these days,” interjected the entrepreneur. “this isn’t the s. my inbox is full. my schedule is packed. i have back-to-back meetings most days. i need to do pitches. i feel like i can never keep up with all that’s coming at me. shooting for mastery isn’t easy.” “i understand,” the billionaire replied kindly. “less is more, you know? you’re attempting too much. geniuses understand that it’s smarter to create one masterwork than one thousand ordinary pieces. one of the reasons i love being around the finest art is that the belief systems, emotional inspiration and ways of working of those great virtuosos rub off on me. and i can tell you with absolute certainty, these epic performers inhabited an entirely different universe than most people in business and society populate today, as i’ve suggested.” just then, a brilliantly colored butterfly perched on the very tip of stone riley’s left ear. he smiled and said, “hey, little buddy—nice to see you again.” the magnate then added, “when you deconstruct how the superstars, virtuosos and geniuses achieved what they did, you’ll realize that it was their heightened awareness of the opportunities for daily greatness that inspired them to make the better daily choices that yielded"
sharma,"better daily results.” mr. riley pointed to the learning model. “that’s the power of self-education,” he went on. “as you become aware of new ideas, you’ll grow as a producer and as a person. as you escalate your personal and professional development, the level at which you implement and execute around your gorgeous ambitions will rise. and, of course, as your ability to make your dreams and visions into reality increases, you’ll be rewarded with greater income and higher impact,” the magnate spoke as he tapped a finger onto step three of the diagram. “this is why agreeing to this training with me was such a smart move. and this is what this framework here is designed to teach you.” the billionaire scratched his lean abs. and inhaled a deep breath of ocean air. “and may i say that because of the way the remarkable ones saw the world and how they behaved when it came to their crafts, and because they showed up in their lives so very differently from the way the mass of humanity operates, they were called kooks. misfits. weirdos. they weren’t!” exclaimed the billionaire, exuberantly. “they just played at a much higher level—in rare-air. they brought rigor to what they did. they’d spend weeks, months, sometimes years getting the finishing touches perfect. they forced themselves to stay with the work when they felt alone or scared or bored. they persisted in the translation of their heroic visions into everyday reality when they were misunderstood, ridiculed and even attacked. god, i admire the great geniuses of the world. i really do.” “‘the further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it,’” offered the artist succinctly. the entrepreneur looked at him as she began to rub a bracelet on her wrist. “george orwell said that,” he pronounced. “and ‘whenever you are creating beauty around you, you are restoring your own soul,’” the artist carried on. “alice walker said that.” “the masters produce in a way that ordinary workers would label as ‘obsessive,’” expounded the industrialist. “but the reality of remarkability is that what the % of performers call ‘picky behavior’ surrounding an important project, the top % of creators know is simply the price of admission for world-class. here, look at the model again so we can bring even more precision to your understanding around it,” instructed the billionaire as he touched the diagram on the piece of silk. “the majority of people on the planet today really are trapped in superficiality,” he confirmed. “superficial understanding of their power to rise. superficial intimacy with the possibilities of their potential. superficial knowledge of the neurobiology of mastery, the daily routines of the world-builders and the very ambitions they wish to prioritize the remainder of their lives around. the majority is stuck in vague, imprecise thinking. and vague, imprecise thinking yields vague, imprecise results. a quick example: ask the average person for directions and most of the time, you’ll discover, their instructions are unclear. that’s because the way they think is unclear,” said the billionaire as he picked up a stick from the beach and pointed it toward the word “granularity” on the framework. “legendary achievers are vastly different. they get that amateur levels of awareness will never lead to the highest grade of professional results. another example that i hope will dial in this important insight for you two. i’m a huge fan of formula one racing. i was invited to hang out with my favorite team in the pit area recently. their attention to the slightest of particulars, their dedication to the demonstration of extreme excellence and their willingness to do whatever it took to make things great was not only validating but tremendously inspiring. again, to the ordinary person, the suggestion of the need for an obsessive attention to the most minor of details and the importance of a ridiculously rigorous approach in their pro and private lives seems odd. but that f crew! their flawless calibration of the race car, their superhuman speed in executing pit stops and even the way they cleaned the pit area with an industrial vacuum cleaner after the car roared away so there wasn’t even a hint of dirt anywhere was fantastic. this is my point. the top % go granular versus applying a superficial mindset to their daily attitudes, behaviors and activities.” “they really sweat the fine points so much they removed the dirt from the pit area after the race car left?” questioned the artist, fascinated. “yep,” remarked the billionaire. “they swept and vacuumed the whole bay. and when i asked them why, they told me that if even a molecule of sediment got into the race machine’s engine it could cost them a win. or even worse—it could result in the loss of a life. actually, any small failure of even one team member to act with precision could create a tragedy. one loose screw left by an unfocused crew member could lead to a calamity. one checklist item missed by a distracted associate might cause a catastrophe. or one missing measurement overlooked by a squad partner leaving some of his precious attention on the phone he was playing with prior to the pit stop could cost a victory.” “i’m beginning to agree with you that the approach you are speaking of is important,” admitted the entrepreneur. “very few businesspeople and those in other fields like the arts, sciences and sports think and behave like this anymore. it used to be normal, i guess. developing high awareness around the things that we do and having a painstaking approach to making our work perfect. refining the details. sweating the little points. producing with precision rather than being unprofessional and careless. underpromising and overdelivering. taking immense pride in our craft. going deep and embracing—to use your words—granularity versus superficiality.” “i must give credit where it’s due,” said the billionaire humbly. “this languaging and this model was taught to me by the spellbinder."
sharma,"but, yes. small things matter when it comes to mastery. i read somewhere that the space shuttle challenger disaster, which broke so many hearts, was caused by the failure of a single o-ring seal that some experts valued at seventy cents. a horrific ending of lives was caused by a flaw around what appeared to be an insignificant detail.” “this all makes me think of the dutch genius vermeer,” the artist contributed. “he was a painter who pursued work of the highest quality. he experimented with different techniques that would allow natural light to fall in a way that made his art look three-dimensional. there was such a depth to what he created. such attractiveness to each stroke and such refinement in every move. so, i agree too: the average artist has a really light, basic, impatient approach to their painting. their focus is more on the cash than on the craft. their attention is on the fame, not the finesse. i guess that because of this, they never build the higher awareness and acumen that will help them make the better choices that will give them the better results that will make them the legends of their fields. i’m starting to get how powerful this simple model is.” “i love vermeer’s woman in blue reading a letter and, of course, girl with a pearl earring ,” said the billionaire, cementing the fact that he appreciated great art. “i love this insight that you’re sharing with us,” observed the entrepreneur as her eyes widened. she then grasped the artist’s hand. mr. riley winked. “i knew this was coming,” he muttered with obvious happiness on seeing their growing romantic connection. he closed his eyes, once again. the butterfly was still sitting on the ear of the eccentric tycoon. as it flapped its exotic-colored wings, mr. riley spoke these words from the mighty poet rumi: gamble everything for love, if you are a true human being. if not, leave this gathering. half-heartedness doesn’t reach into majesty. “can i ask you a question?” wondered the entrepreneur. “absolutely,” replied the billionaire. “how does this philosophy of rigor and granularity play out in personal relationships?” “not well,” was the candid reply of the shirtless baron. “the spellbinder schooled me on a concept called ‘the dark side of genius.’ basically, the idea is that every human gift comes with a downside. and the very quality that makes you special in one area is the same one that makes you a misfit in another. the reality is that many of the great virtuosos of the world had messy private lives. the very gifts of seeing a vision few else could see, holding themselves to the absolute highest of standards, being content alone for long stretches of time as they worked monomaniacally detailing the most minor points on their projects, behaving relentlessly in following through on their masterpieces, acting with rarely seen self-discipline and listening to their hearts while ignoring their critics made personal relationships hard. they were misunderstood and seen as ‘difficult’ and ‘different,’ ‘rigid’ and ‘unbalanced.’” the billionaire then fell to the sand and started doing more push-ups at a ferocious pace. next, while staring at a white dove that glided over the roof of his oceanside home, he did twenty burpees. then he carried on. “and many of these legends of creativity, productivity and world-class performance were out of balance,” the magnate stated. “they were perfectionists, mavericks and fanatics. this is the dark side of genius. the very things that make you amazing at your craft can devastate your home life. just telling you cats the truth,” observed the billionaire as he sipped from a water bottle that had tiny lettering on it. if you looked at it closely and carefully, here’s what you’d read: philip of macedonia in a message to sparta: “you are advised to submit without further delay, for if i bring my army into your land, i will destroy your farms, slay your people and raze your city.” sparta’s reply: “if.” “but just because your gifts have downsides to them doesn’t mean you shouldn’t express them!” expounded the billionaire energetically. “you just need to develop awareness around where they can lead you into trouble in your personal life and then manage those traps. and this brings me beautifully back to this morning’s learning model that really does set the stage for everything you’ll learn about the transformational value of the am club—and how to lock it in as an enduring habit.” the industrialist bent down, picked up a sea-worn stick and touched it to the silk swatch. “please always remember the core maxim for elite performance that this framework for personal greatness has been built around: with better daily awareness you can make better daily choices, and with better daily choices you’ll start seeing better daily results. the spellbinder calls this the step success formula. see, with better awareness of your natural ability to achieve great things, for example, or on how installing the am method into your morning routine will upgrade your productivity, you’ll rise from the community of superficiality that currently dominates the earth up into the society of granularity. this heightened level of insight and consciousness will then optimize your daily decisions. and, logically, once you get your daily choices right, you’ll accelerate your leadership, accomplishment and impact dramatically. because it’s your decisions that make your results.” “for one of our coaching sessions,” the billionaire continued, “the spellbinder and i met in lucerne, switzerland. such a pretty city set on a magnificent lake surrounded by breathtaking mountains. sort of a fairy-tale kind of a place. anyhoo, one morning he ordered a pot of hot water, along with some lemon wedges so he could have the fresh lemon tea he enjoys sipping most mornings. here’s the thing …” “this should be interesting,” the artist interrupted as he scratched an arm with a tattoo built around an andy warhol quote that said: “i never think that people die. they just"
sharma,"go to department stores.” “the tray arrived,” the billionaire went on. “perfect silverware. excellent china. everything calibrated to the highest order. and get this: whoever cut the lemons in the kitchen exercised the deep-craft rigor essential to sustained mastery by actually going the extra mile—and carving the seeds out of the wedges. amazing, right?” the billionaire began to do the same quirky dance that he did at the conference center. then he stopped. the entrepreneur and the artist shook their heads. “a pretty uncommon level of care and attention to detail in a world of such superficiality and performers stuck in apathy,” said the entrepreneur, pretending not to be distracted by the mogul’s dancing. “the spellbinder calls the phenomenon pervading commerce these days ‘the collective de-professionalization of business,’” noted the billionaire. “people who should be working, delighting customers, showcasing extraordinary skills, unlocking otherworldly value for their organizations so both they and their firms experience success are watching inane videos on their phones, shopping online for shoes or scrolling through their social feeds. i’ve never seen people so disengaged at work, so checked out and so exhausted. and i’ve never seen people making so many mistakes.” the billionaire pointed the crooked stick at the step success formula again. “deseeding the lemon wedges is a fine metaphor to challenge you to consistently make the shift from superficiality to granularity. real rigor in terms of your approach to not only what you do at work but how you operate in your private life. true depth as it relates to how you think, behave and deliver. healthy perfectionism—and an unyielding quest to be the best that you are capable of becoming is what i’m suggesting to you two good folks here on this awesome beach. this will give you what the spellbinder calls a ‘gca: gargantuan competitive advantage.’ it’s never been so easy to own the sport in business today because so few performers are doing the things required to reach industry dominance. mastery is a rarity, and people who play at a brilliant level are a scarcity. so, the field is yours! if you show up the way i’m encouraging you to show up. here’s the powerful insight: there’s a ton of competition at ordinary, but there’s almost none at extraordinary. there’s never been such a glamorous opportunity to become peerless because so few people are dedicated to world-class in this age of such scattered focus, eroded values and deteriorated faith in ourselves along with the inherent primal power we hold. how often do you meet someone at a store or in a restaurant who is fully present, astoundingly polite, unusually knowledgeable, full of enthusiasm, incredibly hardworking, intensely imaginative, noticeably inventive and gaspworthily great at what they do? almost never, right?” “yes,” acknowledged the entrepreneur. “i’d have to interview thousands of people to find one treasure like this.” “so, you cats have a gca! lucky you,” shouted the billionaire. “you can pretty much dominate your fields because so few are like this now. raise your commitment. step up your standards. and then get busy on hardwiring in this way of being as your default. and that’s really important: you have to optimize daily . consistency really is the dna of mastery. and small, daily, seemingly insignificant improvements when done consistently over time yield staggering results. please remember that great companies and wonderful lives don’t happen by sudden revolution. nope. they materialize via incremental evolution. tiny, daily wins and iterations stack into outcomes of excellence, over the long-term. but few of us have the patience these days to endure the long game. as a result, not many of us ever become legends.” “all this information is fantastic. and so valuable for my art,” the artist said gratefully as he put his shirt back on. “wonderful to hear,” acknowledged the billionaire. “look, i know that you both have experienced a ton of learning in a very short time. i understand that getting up early is a new skill you’re installing and everything you’ve heard about chasing greatness, leaving the crowd, relinquishing average and renouncing ordinary is probably overwhelming. so just breathe—and relax, please. exceptionalism is a journey. virtuosity is a voyage. rome wasn’t built in a day, right?” “right,” agreed the artist. “definitely,” accepted the entrepreneur. “and i also get that rising into the more pure reaches of your superior strengths and most sovereign human gifts is an uncomfortable and scary process. i’ve been through it and the rewards that are on their way to you as you remain dedicated to learning the am method are worth more than any amount of money, fame and worldly power you’ll ever have. and what i’ve taught you today is a necessary component to the system for waking before daybreak and preparing yourself to be an elite achiever and luminous human being that we’ll go much deeper into in our upcoming sessions together. i guess what i really want to say before i let you cats go for this morning, so you can go have some fun, is that while growth as a producer and as a person can be hard—it truly is the finest work a human being can ever do. and fully remember that you are most alive when your heart beats quickest. and we are most awake when our fears scream loudest.” “so, we need to keep going ahead, right?” confirmed the entrepreneur as a lovely ocean breeze washed through her brown hair. “absolutely,” said the tycoon. “all shadows of insecurity dissolve in the warm glow of persistency. “okay. one last example about assuming a rigorous approach in your professional and home life and gaining a gca by going all granular on important projects, around essential skills and during meaningful activities. after that, i’d love for you two to go swimming, snorkeling and sunbathing. you should see the spectacular lunch my team has prepared for you! i need to head into port louis for a meeting, but i really hope you both will make yourselves"
sharma,"at home. so …” mr. riley stopped for a moment, reached down and touched his toes four times while muttering the following mantra: “today is a glorious day and i’ll live it at excellence, with boundless enthusiasm and limitless integrity, true to my visions and with a heart full of love.” “i remember reading an article,” the billionaire continued, “where the ceo of moncler, the italian fashion company, was asked what his favorite food was. he replied it was spaghetti pomodoro. then he shared that while this dish seems strikingly simple to prepare as it’s only pasta, fresh tomatoes, olive oil and basil, the executive remarked that to get the ‘calibration’ correct takes unusual expertise and uncommon prowess. that’s an important word for all three of us to keep top of mind as we tighten up our a-games, elevate our performance and accelerate our contribution to the world: calibration . dialing in the finest of attitudes and refining the littlest of details is what granularity and ascension into the orbit of your inherent genius—and a life magically lived—is all about.” the eccentric magnate then placed the piece of silk from the bottle into a pocket of his shorts. and vanished. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the focuses of history-makers “the life given us, by nature is short, but the memory of a well-spent life is eternal.” —cicero the sunrise was dazzling as the entrepreneur and the artist walked hand-in-hand along the seashore to meet the billionaire at the designated meeting spot for the next morning’s mentoring class. mr. riley was already there when they arrived, sitting on the sand, eyes closed in a deep meditation. he was shirtless, wearing camouflage-patterned shorts similar to the ones the spellbinder styled the day he appeared on the beach and a pair of rubber diving booties with smiley face emojis scattered over them. you would have been more than amused if you saw him in them. an assistant rushed out of the billionaire’s home the instant he raised a hand toward the heavens, displaying the universal victory sign. three crisp pages of paper were efficiently extracted from a shiny black leather satchel and handed to the titan of industry without a word being exchanged. stone riley simply offered a slight bow of appreciation. in turn, he gave a sheet to each of his two students. it was exactly am . the billionaire then picked up a seashell and skipped it across the water. it appeared as if he had something profound on his mind this morning. gone were the usual lightheartedness, festivity and awkward antics. “you okay?” inquired the entrepreneur as she touched a bracelet engraved with the words “straight on hustle. rise and grind. i’ll sleep when i’m dead.” the tycoon read the words on the bangle. he placed a finger onto his lips. “who will cry when you die?” he asked. “what?” exclaimed the artist. “what will those who know you whisper about how you lived once you’re no longer here?” the billionaire articulated the question in the manner of a skilled actor. “you live as if you were destined to live forever, no thought of your frailty ever enters your head, of how much time has already gone by you take no heed. you squander time as if you drew from a full and abundant supply, though all the while that day which you bestow on some person or thing is perhaps your last.” “those are your thoughts? brilliant,” stated the artist. the billionaire looked mildly embarrassed. “i wish! no, they belong to the stoic philosopher seneca. they came from his treatise on the shortness of life .” “so why are we talking about death on this beautiful morning exactly?” queried the entrepreneur, appearing a little uncomfortable. “because most of us alive today wish we had more time. yet we waste the time we have. thinking about dying brings what matters most into much sharper focus. you’ll stop allowing digital distraction, cyber diversions and online nuisances to steal the irreplaceable hours of the blessing called your life. you never get your days back, you know?” said the billionaire in a friendly but firm fashion. “i reread chasing daylight yesterday after my meeting in town. it’s the true story of high-powered ceo eugene o’kelly, who was informed he had only a few months left to live when his doctor discovered he had three brain tumors.” “so, what did he do?” asked the artist softly. “he organized his last days with the same commitment to orderliness he ran his business life by. o’kelly tried to make up for the school concerts he’d missed, the family outings he’d passed up and the friendships he’d forgotten. in one part of the book he shared how he’d ask a friend out for a walk in nature and that this ‘was sometimes not only the final time we would take such a leisurely walk together but also the first time.’” “sad,” was the contribution of the entrepreneur as she nervously played with her bracelet. the worry lines on her forehead reappeared in full blazing glory. “then last night i watched the diving bell and the butterfly , one of my favorite movies,” the billionaire continued. “it’s also a true story, about a man who was also atop the world, an editor-in-chief of french elle magazine. jean-dominique bauby had it all and then suffered a stroke that left him unable to move any muscle in his body—except for his left eyelid. the condition’s called ‘locked-in syndrome.’ his mind still worked perfectly. but it was as if his body was encased in a diving bell, totally paralyzed.” “sad,” said the artist, echoing his companion. “get this,” added mr. riley. “his rehabilitation therapists taught him a communication method called ‘silent alphabet’ which allowed him to form letters of words by blinking. and with their help, he wrote a book about his experience—and the essential meaning of life. it took him two hundred thousand blinks, but he completed the book.” “i have nothing"
sharma,"to complain about,” the entrepreneur said quietly. “he passed away shortly after the book was published,” the billionaire kept on. “but the point i’m trying to offer with all this is that life is very, very fragile. there are people who will wake up today, take a shower, put on their clothes, drink their coffee, eat their oatmeal—and then be killed in a motor vehicle collision on their way to the office. that’s just life happening. so, my advice to you two special human beings is not to put off doing whatever it takes to express your natural genius. live in a way that feels true to you and pay attention to the small miracles every day brings.” “i hear you,” commented the artist as he tugged a dreadlock and fidgeted with the panama hat he’d chosen to wear for this morning’s coaching session. “i do, too,” stated the entrepreneur somberly. “enjoy every sandwich,” added the artist. “very wise insight,” said mr. riley. “it’s not mine,” the artist replied sheepishly. “they are the words of songwriter warren zevon. he spoke them after he discovered he was terminally ill.” “be grateful for every moment. don’t be timid when it comes to your ambitions. stop wasting time on insanely trivial things. and make it a priority to reclaim the creativity, fire and potential that is dormant within you. it’s so important to do so. why do you think plato encouraged us to ‘know thyself’? he understood intimately that we have vast reservoirs of ability that absolutely must be accessed and then applied in order for us to lead energetic, joyful, peaceful and meaningful lives. to neglect this hidden force inside of us is to create a breeding ground for the pain of potential unused, the frustration of fearlessness unembraced and the lethargy of mastery unexplored.” a kite surfer whizzed by. and a school of crown squirrelfish sailed through the water that was as clear as abe lincoln’s conscience. “this brings us beautifully to what i wanted to walk you through this morning. please look carefully at your sheet of paper,” the billionaire instructed. here is the learning model that the two students saw: history-maker focus #: capitalization iq the mogul explained the concept of capitalization developed by eminent psychologist james flynn. the valuable insight he conceived is that what makes a legendary performer so good isn’t the amount of natural talent they are born into but the extent of that potential they actualize—and capitalize. “many of the finest athletes in the world,” mr. riley observed, “had less innate skill than their competition. but it was their exceptional dedication, commitment and drive to maximize whatever strengths they had that made them iconic. “it’s the old ‘it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog’ insight,” declared the billionaire as he rubbed his chiseled abdominals absentmindedly and put on a new pair of sunglasses, the kind you’d see on a surfer in southern california. “the spellbinder taught me early on that by joining the am club, i’d have a gorgeous window of opportunity every morning to cultivate my highest assets, take some time for myself and do the preparation needed for me to make each day a tiny gem. he helped me understand that successful people use their mornings well and that by rising before daybreak, i’d win a primary victory that would set me up for a triumphant day.” “i never seem to have any ‘me time,’” interjected the entrepreneur. “my schedule’s always so full,” she repeated. “i’d love to have a block in the morning to recharge my batteries—and do some things that would make me a happier and better person.” “exactly,” remarked the billionaire. “so many of us lead time-starved lives. we absolutely need to have at least an hour first thing in the morning to refuel, grow and become healthier, more peaceful people. getting up at am and then running the // formula , which you’ll soon learn will give you an extraordinary head start on your days. you’ll be able to concentrate on high-value activities instead of letting your day control you. you’ll experience energy you never knew you had. the joyfulness you’ll reclaim will blow you away. and your sense of personal freedom will totally soar.” mr. riley then turned around to display a temporary tattoo on his muscled back. it bore a quote by french philosopher albert camus that read: “the only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.” below these words, on the industrialist’s back, was an image of a phoenix rising from the flames. it looked exactly like this: mae besom “i so need this,” the entrepreneur said. “i know my productivity, gratefulness and calmness would improve so much if i had some personal time every morning before it all gets so hectic.” “me, too,” said the artist. “an hour to myself every morning to reflect and prepare would be a game-changer for my art. and for my life.” “the spellbinder taught me early on that investing sixty minutes in developing my best self and my greatest skills during what he called ‘the victory hour’ would transform the way the rest of my life unfolded mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. he promised it would give me one of those gargantuan competitive advantages we discussed yesterday. and lead to the formation of absolute empires of creativity, money, joy and helpfulness to humanity. and i need to say he was completely right. “anyhoo,” chirped the billionaire. “back to the concept of capitalization and the importance of intelligently exploiting whatever primal gifts you’ve been given. too many among us have bought into the collective hypnosis that those with extraordinary skill are cut from a different cloth and have been divinely blessed by the gods of exceptional talent. but that just ain’t so,” observed the billionaire, a wisp of his farm boy manner emerging."
sharma,"“ dedication and discipline beats brilliance and giftedness every day of the week . and a-players don’t get lucky. they make lucky. each time you resist a temptation and pursue an optimization you invigorate your heroism. every instant you do that which you know to be right over the thing that you feel would be easy, you facilitate your entry into the hall of fame of epic achievers.” the billionaire stared at a gigantic seagull clutching its slimy breakfast. he then released a loud burp. “oops. so sorry,” he spoke in the tone of apology. “as i mentioned earlier, a lot of the latest research emerging on successful people is confirming that our private story about our potential is the key performance indicator on whether we actually exploit that potential.” “what do you mean?” requested the entrepreneur as she stopped taking notes on her device to look into the eyes of the billionaire, who had now put on a tight t-shirt that read, “victims have big tvs. leaders own large libraries.” “well, if you’re running a mental narrative that says that you don’t have what it takes to be a superb leader in business or an acclaimed expert of your craft, then you won’t even start the adventure of getting there, will you? and world-class is a process, not an event . running a limiting psychological program that says ‘everyday people can’t become great’ or ‘genius is born, not developed’ will cause you to think it would be a complete waste of time to do the studying, put in the practice hours and prioritize your days around your heartfelt desires. what would be the point of investing all that labor, vigor and time and making all those sacrifices when virtuoso-level results are impossible for someone like you, under your belief system? and then, because your daily behavior is always a function of your deepest beliefs, that very perception of your inability to realize victory becomes real,” noted the billionaire. “human beings are hardwired to act in alignment with our self-identity, always. you’ll never rise higher than your personal story. important insight there.” he then peered out into the ocean at a small fishing boat with a net strewn across the end of it. a fisherman in a red shirt was smoking a cigarette as he navigated the vessel away from some dangerous coral reef. the billionaire mumbled another mantra to himself. “i am grateful. and i am forgiving. i am giving. my life is beautiful, creative, productive, prosperous and magical.” then he continued the discussion around capitalization. “the positive psychologists call the way we embrace a story about who we are and what we can achieve and then behave in a way that makes that fantasy actually come true ‘the self-fulfilling prophecy.’ we subconsciously adopt a thinking pattern by learning it from the people who most influence us at an early age. our parents, our teachers and our friends. then we act according to it. and since what we do creates the results we see, this generally faulty personal story becomes a reality of our very own causing. amazing, right? but that’s how most of us operate through the best years of our lives. the world is a mirror. and we get from life not what we want, but that which we are.” “and i guess that the more we accept that core belief about our inability to produce excellent results in whatever it is we hope to do, the more we not only reinforce it so it becomes a trusted conviction but we also deepen the behavior that’s associated with it so it becomes a daily habit,” recited the artist, sounding professorish instead of bohemian in the pure morning air. “wonderfully said!” replied the billionaire excitedly. “i love the ‘trusted conviction’ idea. that’s good. you should share that phrase with the spellbinder if you see him today. i think he’s out fishing but, knowing him, he’ll be getting some sun here on this beach later in the morning.” the billionaire continued. “every human being has an instinct for greatness, a hunger for the heroic and a psychic need to rise toward the heavens of their finest capability, whether we remember this consciously or not. a lot of us have been minimized and pushed down so much by the dark and toxic influences around us we’ve forgotten all we truly are. we’ve become masters of compromise, slowly and steadily allowing in more aspects of mediocrity until a point arrives where it’s our standard operating system. real leaders never negotiate their standards. they know there’s always room to improve. they understand that we are most connected to our sovereign nature when we are reaching for our best. alexander the great once said: ‘i am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; i am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.’” the billionaire inhaled audibly. a butterfly fluttered by. and a crab scampered past him. “i’m here to remind you,” he carried on, “that each one of us holds a profound capacity for leadership within us. and as you now know, i’m not speaking of leadership in the sense of having a title, a lofty position or needing some formal authority. what i’m referring to is so much more weighty and exquisite than that. it’s the true power inside a human heart versus the transitory power delivered by a big office, a fast car and a large bank balance. what i’m speaking of is the potency to do work that is so great we just can’t take our eyes off you. the capability to create massive value in your marketplace. the capacity to impact—and disrupt—an entire industry. and the power to live with honor, nobility, audacity and integrity. so that you fulfill your opportunity to make history, in your own original way. doesn’t matter if you’re a ceo or a janitor. a billionaire or a ditch digger. a movie star or a student. if you"
sharma,"are alive today, you have the ability to lead without a title and make your mark on the world, even if you don’t currently believe you can due to the limits of your current perception. your perception isn’t reality. it just isn’t. it’s just your current perception on reality, kindly remember that. it’s simply the lens you happen to be looking at reality through at this moment of your ascent toward world-class. makes me think of the words of the german philosopher arthur schopenhauer, who wrote, ‘most people take the limits of their vision to be the limits of the world. a few do not. join them.’” “so, there’s a large difference between reality and our perception of reality, right?” inquired the entrepreneur. “it seems from what you’re saying that it’s almost as if we see the world through a filter that’s made up of all our personal programming. and we run the program so much we get brainwashed into believing that the way we are seeing the world is real, right? you’ve got me rethinking the way i see everything now,” she admitted as the skin on her forehead scrunched together like a rose contracting in the cold. “i’m beginning to question so much,” she went on. “why i started my business in the first place. why social status is so important to me. why i have such urges to eat in the sleekest restaurants, live in the best neighborhoods and drive the most stylish cars. i think part of the reason i’ve been so crushed by the takeover attempt at my company is because i get my identity as a human being from being the founder. honestly, i’ve been so busy driving my career, i haven’t stopped for gas in terms of really thinking things through—and living intentionally. and it’s like the step success formula you taught us yesterday. as i develop better daily awareness around myself and why it is that i do what i do, i’ll make the better daily choices that will give me better daily results.” the entrepreneur was unstoppable. “i have no clue what my authentic values are, what i want to represent as a leader, why i’m building what i’m building, what really makes me happy and how i want to be remembered when i’m no longer here. the story of that ceo and the stroke of that editor really spoke to me. life really is super-fragile. and—now that i’m speaking so openly—i think i’ve been spending many days chasing the wrong things. stuck in the noise of complexity instead of hearing the signal of those top-value pursuits in my career and in my private life that would really make a difference. and i think about the past a lot. what happened to me in my childhood. i also haven’t had any time for any friendships. i have no real passions. i’ve never watched the sun rise, until now. and i’ve never found true love,” said the entrepreneur as she anxiously rubbed her bracelet. the entrepreneur looked over to the artist. “until now.” tears filled his eyes. “trillions of planets in this universe,” he pronounced, “billions of people on our planet and i was fortunate enough to meet you.” the entrepreneur smiled and then proceeded to respond in a gentle tone. “i hope i never lose you.” “don’t be too hard on yourself,” interjected the billionaire. “we’re all on our paths, know what i mean? we’re all exactly where we need to be to receive the growth lessons we’re meant to learn. and a problem will persist until you get the education it showed up to bring. and i do agree with you that human beings have a tragic habit of remembering the things that would be smart to forget and forgetting the wonderful things it would be wise to remember. anyhoo, i do understand you. please just trust that the highest and wisest part of you is leading you. there are no accidents on this path to legendary and the making of a life that matters. and, if you ask me, there’s nothing wrong with magnificent homes, fast cars and lots of money. i really, really need you to hear me on that. please. we are spiritual beings having a human experience—as the old saying goes. having plenty of money is what life wants for you. abundance is nature’s way. there’s no scarcity of flowers, lemon trees and stars in the sky. money allows you to do superb things for yourself—and for the people you care most about. and it offers you the chance to help those in need.” a tourist waterskiing behind a speedboat zoomed by. you could hear him laughing with glee. “i’ll let you in on a little secret,” the magnate continued. “i’ve given away most of my vast liquid fortune. yes, i still have the jets and the zurich flat and this oceanside place. and though my business interests are still valued at an amount that makes me a billionaire, i need none of it. i’m not attached to any of this.” “i read a story that i think you’ll like,” shared the artist. “kurt vonnegut, the writer, and joseph heller, the author of catch-, were at a party hosted by a renowned financier on long island. vonnegut asked his companion how it felt to know that their host made more money in the day before the gala than he had made from all royalties of his bestselling book. heller replied, ‘i’ve got something he can never have.’ vonnegut asked, ‘what on earth could that be, joe?’ heller’s reply was priceless: ‘the knowledge that i’ve got enough.’” “brilliant!” enthused the billionaire. “love it!” he shouted inappropriately loudly as he high-fived the artist. he then performed the little dance he loved to do when he was happy yet again before launching into a series of jumping jacks. his eyes were closed as he did them. such an oddball. the artist went on talking. “anyway, i understand what you’re"
sharma,"teaching us on this point about capitalization and the self-fulfilling prophecy. no one will believe in our ability to do great things until we first believe in our greatness and then put in the sincere and rigorous effort to realize it. you know what pablo picasso once said?” “tell us, please,” implored the entrepreneur, her stance showing that she was very open in this instant. “picasso announced, ‘my mother said to me, if you are a soldier, you will become a general. if you are a monk, you will become the pope. instead, i was a painter. and became picasso.’” “gnarly, man,” the billionaire remarked. “now that’s faith and confidence in one’s potential.” the billionaire ran a fist along his tanned chin, looking down at the white sand for a moment. “and it’s not only our parents who are responsible for the limited programs most people are running through their minds during the finest hours of their greatest days. like i suggested, many well-meaning yet unaware teachers reinforce the idea that the heroic geniuses of the arts, sciences, sports and humanities are ‘special’ and that we need to accept that we are ‘ordinary,’ incapable of producing towering work that leaves people breathless by its excellence and generating a life that is matchless. and then we have the association of our friends and relentless messaging of the media supporting the same ‘facts.’ essentially it all becomes this consistent hypnotization where, without us even knowing it, the once-blazing fire of genius within us grows dimmer. and the once-passionate voices of possibility get quieter. we minimize our abilities and begin a lifelong process of playing small with our powers and constructing prisons around our strengths. we stop behaving as leaders, creative producers and possibilitarians. and we start acting as victims.” “disappointing what happens to so many good people. and most of us can’t see this brainwashing away from our best selves happening,” reflected the entrepreneur. “yup,” responded the billionaire. “even worse, the potential unexpressed turns to pain, i need to emphasize.” “what do you mean by that?” wondered the artist, turning his eyes away and shifting his posture somewhat nervously. “maybe i’m sabotaging creating art as original and exceptional as the great masters did because i’ve avoided capitalizing on my potential for so long that i’m hurting deep inside,” the artist thought to himself. “well, our noblest selves know the truth: each of us are built to do astonishing things with our human gifts and materialize astounding feats with our productive talents. the word ‘astonish’ is actually derived from the latin word ‘extonare,’ which means ‘to leave someone thunderstruck.’ every single person alive today carries the capacity deep within their hearts—and spirits—to do this. the more we decrease the volume of our unhealthy narrative which, neurobiologically speaking, is a creation of our limbic system, the more we will hear this sublime call on ourselves to rise up to the blatant expression of our greatest genius. this is true whether you’re a supervisor within a large organization, a programmer in a small cubicle, a teacher in a school or a chef in a restaurant. you absolutely have the capacity to lift your work to the level of artistry and have an impact for the betterment of humanity. and yet we resign our lives to apathy because of this faulty perception of who we truly are and what we can really accomplish, staying violently stuck in half-alive lives. and here’s the really big idea: as we betray our true power, a part of us starts to die,” noted the billionaire. “dramatic insight,” acknowledged the artist. “i seriously need to make some massive changes. i’m tired of feeling tired. and neglecting my creative abilities. i’m beginning to get that i’m special.” “you are,” affirmed the entrepreneur. “you are,” she repeated, in a voice of tenderness. “i’m also starting to see that i care too much about what others think. some of my friends make fun of my paintings. and they say i’m a screwball behind my back. i’m realizing they just don’t understand me. and my vision for my art.” “many of the great geniuses of the world were not appreciated until decades after they died, you know,” the billionaire offered, in a murmur. “and on your point about your friends, i’m not so sure you’re surrounding yourself with the right ones. and maybe now it’s time to do you rather than limiting your talent and aliveness because you are seduced by the opinions of others. kurt cobain said it better than i ever could: ‘i was tired of pretending that i was someone else just to get along with people, just for the sake of having friendships.’” “hmm,” was the artist’s only response. “what i’m sharing is accurate. we become our associations. and you’ll never have a positive influence in your field and make a beautiful life if you hang with negative people,” continued the billionaire. “oh—and that pain i was just speaking of—if not attended to and released—starts to form a deep reservoir of fear and self-hatred within us. most of us don’t have the awareness or possess the tools to process through this well of suppressed anguish. most of us are unconscious to this quiet torment created by the disrespect we have shown to our promise. and so, we deny it if someone even suggests it. we flee from it when presented with an opportunity to manifest it. and we subconsciously develop a series of soul-crushing escape routes to avoid feeling this pain generated by our talents denied.” “like what?” quizzed the entrepreneur. “addictions. like constantly checking for messages or scanning for ‘likes.’ or spending vast chunks of our daily lives watching too much television. tv shows have become so superb these days, it’s so easy to get hooked. and when one episode ends, on some viewing platforms, the next one begins automatically. many among us also make flights from their greatness by chatting and gossiping endlessly, not really understanding that there’s a"
sharma,"staggering difference between being busy and being productive . “high-impact performers and genuine world-builders aren’t very available to whoever seeks their attention and demands their time. they’re hard to reach, waste few moments and are far more focused on doing real work versus artificial work—so they deliver the breathtaking results that advance our world. other avoidance tactics from the pain of potential unexpressed are hours mindlessly surfing online, electronic shopping, working too much, drinking too much, eating too much, complaining too much and sleeping too much.” the tycoon sipped from his water bottle. another fishing boat motored by. the woman who captained it waved to mr. riley, who bowed mightily in reply. “the spellbinder calls this whole phenomenon ‘learned victimhood,’” the billionaire carried on in a wonderfully exuberant way. “as we leave our youth, there’s a pull toward complacency. we can start to coast, settle for what’s familiar and lose the juicy desire to expand our frontiers. we adopt the paradigm of a victim. we make excuses and then recite them so many times we train our subconscious mind to think they are true. we blame other people and outer conditions for our struggles, and we condemn past events for our private wars. we grow cynical and lose the curiosity, wonder, compassion and innocence we knew as kids. we become apathetic. critical. hardened. within this personal ecosystem the majority of us create for ourselves, mediocrity then becomes acceptable. and because this mindset is running within us each day, the viewpoint seems so very real to us. we truly believe that the story we are running reveals the truth—because we’re so close to it. so, rather than showing leadership in our fields, owning our crafts by producing dazzling work and handcrafting delicious lives, we resign ourselves to average. see how it all happens?” “yes. at least it’s all becoming clearer. so, the key is to rescript our personal story, right?” inquired the entrepreneur. “absolutely,” confirmed the billionaire. “every time you become aware of yourself dropping into victim mode and make a more courageous choice, you rewrite the narrative. you raise your self-identity, elevate your self-respect and enrich your self-confidence. each time you vote for your superior self you starve your weaker side—and feed your inherent power. and as you do this with the consistency demanded by mastery, your ‘capitalization iq,’ that is your ability to materialize whatever gifts you’ve been born with, will only grow.” the billionaire invited his two students to move to the terrace of his home to continue the morning’s lesson on the focuses of history-makers. history-maker focus #: freedom from distraction the billionaire pointed to the model with a pinky finger. “remember that important brain tattoo of successful people? ‘ an addiction to distraction is the death of your creative production .’ it will guide us through this section of today’s mentoring session. and i’ve decided to go deep into the importance of winning the war against diversion and cyber nuisances because it’s an extremely serious issue in our culture. in some ways, the new technologies and social media are not only eroding the everests of our glorious productive potential, they are also training us to be less human. we have fewer real conversations, fewer true connections and fewer meaningful interactions.” “um. yes, i’m realizing this more and more as the mornings pass on this beach,” admitted the entrepreneur. “filling valuable hours with meaningless moves is the drug of choice for most people,” the billionaire continued. “intellectually we know we shouldn’t be wasting time on zero-value activities, but emotionally we just can’t beat the temptation. we just can’t fight the hook. this behavior is costing organizations billions of dollars in lost productivity and deficient quality. and as i suggested earlier, people are making more mistakes in their work than ever before because they aren’t present to what they’re doing. their precious concentration has been hijacked by a foolish use of technology and their priceless focus has been kidnapped, costing them their chance to create their best work and calibrate their finest lives.” the stillness and quietude that only the day’s earliest hours provide was still evident. the industrialist paused. he scanned the entire scene, gazing at the flowers neatly ordered around his home, then at the cargo ships on the horizon that looked like they hadn’t moved and finally at the ocean. “look, cats,” he said at last. “i love the modern world—i really do. without all the technology we have available to us life would be a lot harder. my businesses wouldn’t be as successful as they are, i wouldn’t be as efficient as i am and i possibly wouldn’t be here with you two.” “why?” wondered the artist as a single dolphin swam by gracefully. astoundingly, it then soared high out of the ocean and spun in the air four times before returning to the water with a lavish splash. mr. riley looked delighted. “i’m so happy i discovered how to become a magnet for miracles,” he whispered to himself. “and i can’t wait to teach these good folks how to do the same for themselves.” he then kept on with his discourse. “all the innovations in healthcare tech saved my life when i was sick,” the billionaire explained. “anyhoo, technology well used is a phenomenal thing. it’s all the silly ways people apply it now that really concerns me. so many potentially outstanding people are suffering from ‘broken focus syndrome’ because they’ve filled their professional and personal lives with so many gadgets, interruptions and cybernoise. if you’re in the sport of winning, please model all of the great masters of history and strip away all the layers of complexity from your days. simplify. streamline everything. become a purist. less really is more. concentrate on just a few work projects so you make them amazing versus diluting your attention on too many. and socially, have fewer friends but go deep with them so the relationship is rich. accept fewer invitations, major in fewer leisure activities"
sharma,"and study, then master, a smaller number of books versus skimming many. an intense concentration only on what matters most is how the pros realize victory. simplify. simplify. simplify. “stop managing your time and start managing your focus,” added the billionaire. “now there’s a principle for greatness in this overstimulated society we live in.” “thanks to your teaching so far,” said the artist, “i now understand that being busy doesn’t mean you’re being productive. i’ve also come to see that when i work on a new painting, the closer i get to great art, the more some darker part of me wants to get me distracted so that i avoid doing something mind-blowing. it happens fairly often now that i think about it. i’ll get nearer to fantastic work and i then begin to break my work routine. i’ll go online and just surf. i’ll sleep later and watch entire seasons of my favorite shows or play video games with my virtual friends all night. sometimes i’ll just drink too much cheap red wine.” “the closer you get to your genius, the more you’ll face the sabotage of your fears,” agreed the billionaire powerfully. “you’ll become scared of leaving the majority and having to deal with the by-products of mastery, like being different from most people, jealousy from competitors and the pressure to make your next project even better. as you rise toward virtuosity, you’ll become anxious about failure, threatened by a concern of not being good enough and insecure about blazing new paths. so, your amygdala—an almond-shaped mass of gray matter in the brain that detects fear—gets all fired up. and you begin to tear down the productivity you’ve built up. we all have a subconscious saboteur that lurks within our weakest selves, you know? the good news is that once you become aware of this condition …” “i can make the better daily choices that will give me better daily results,” the artist interrupted with all the energy of a puppy seeing its owner after a long day alone. “exactly,” said the billionaire. “once you are aware of the fact that, as you near your highest talents and most luminous gifts, the scared side of you will rear its ugly head and try to mess up the masterpieces you’ve been creating by pursuing every distraction and escape route possible to avoid finishing, you can manage that self-destructive behavior. you can step outside of it. you can disempower it, simply by watching its attempts to denounce your mastery.” “really profound insights here,” contributed the entrepreneur. “this explains so much about why i’m limiting my productivity, performance and influence at my company. i’ll set an important target. i get the team enrolled in it. we sequence the key deliverables. then i get distracted. i’ll say ‘yes’ to another opportunity that adds more complexity to our business. i’ll fill my days with useless meetings with people who love to hear the sound of their own voice. i’ll check my notifications obsessively and watch ‘breaking news’ reports religiously. this morning it’s become super-clear how i’m totally sabotaging my effectiveness. it’s also pretty obvious that i am addicted to the digital nonsense you’re speaking about. i’ll be honest, i haven’t gotten over some of my exes because it’s so easy to watch their lives on social media. i’m understanding now that a lot of the hours i could be super-creative i trade for online recreation. like you said, mr. riley, it’s a form of escape. i can’t seem to stop shopping on my devices. it’s just too easy. and it makes me feel happy, for a few minutes. i’m getting why steve jobs didn’t give his kids the very things he sold to the world. he understood how addictive they could be, if improperly used. and how they could make us less human and less alive .” the billionaire raised a hand. another assistant sprinted from the beach hut up to the now sun-soaked terrace. he wore a crisp white shirt, charcoal gray sailing shorts and well-cared-for black leather sandals. “here you are, sir,” the young man said with a french accent as he handed the mogul a tray with mysterious markings on it. in the center was a model of the human brain. it looked exactly like this: mae besom “merci beaucoup, pierre. now let’s explore the neuroscience of self-sabotage so you cats can understand it better—and then beat it. remember, each of us has what the spellbinder calls ‘the ancient brain.’ this is made up of the limbic system—a set of brain structures that sit on both sides of the thalamus, right under the cerebrum. the amygdala that i mentioned a few moments ago is part of this. this basic and lower-functioning brain served to keep us safe thousands of years ago in a primitive world of relentless threats like starvation, temperature extremes, warring tribes and saber-toothed tigers. it functions to do one main thing: maintain a steady state while warning us against dangers so we survive and propagate our species. “with me so far?” asked the billionaire politely. “understood.” the entrepreneur and the artist responded in unison as a housekeeper served fresh lemon tea with some chunks of ginger in it. “excellent. one of the fascinating traits of our ancient brain is its negativity bias. to keep us safe, it’s far less interested in what’s positive in our environment and significantly more invested in letting us know what’s bad. “this brain’s default is to hunt for danger,” the billionaire continued happily. “so back when life was much more brutal, we could respond swiftly and stay alive. that mechanism served our ancestors exceedingly well. but in today’s world, most of us don’t face death daily. the reality is that the ordinary person lives a higher quality life than most members of royalty did even just a few hundred years ago. please think about this blessing.” the tycoon slurped some tea. “and yet, because of this built-in negativity bias within our ancient"
sharma,"brains, we’re constantly scanning for breaches against our security. we’re in hypervigilance mode, mostly anxious and uptight, even when everything’s going great. fascinating, right?” “explains a lot of why we think the way we do,” noted the entrepreneur as she, too, enjoyed the tea. “now i see why i always seem to feel i’ve never achieved enough, even though i’ve accomplished more than anyone i know,” the entrepreneur carried on. “i have such a successful business, a robust net worth and before my investors got greedy—a fairly wonderful life. yet despite everything i have, my brain seems to always focus on what i’m missing, where i don’t have enough and how i’m falling short of expectations around winning. drives me crazy. i hardly feel any peace. ever.” the entrepreneur crossed her arms. the artist blew her a kiss as his dreadlocks dangled in the fragrant breeze. “theodore roosevelt said something i think it’s important you hear,” expounded the billionaire. “what did he say?” inquired the entrepreneur, her arms clenched tightly. “‘comparison is the thief of joy,’” responded the billionaire. “someone will always have more fortune, fame and stuff than you do. think about my earlier point about detachment and embracing the wisdom of knowing when enough is enough.” “yes. i remember,” said the entrepreneur courteously. “more and more of this hunger you have comes from deeper feelings of scarcity. and a lot of this is stemming from the workings of your ancient brain. it’s scanning your environment and the negativity bias is being activated, preventing you from enjoying all the good you have. okay,” said the billionaire. “let’s go even more granular. as time advanced, our brains evolved. and the prefrontal cortex developed. this is the part of our brain responsible for higher thinking. neuroscientists consider it the crown jewel of advanced reasoning. the spellbinder calls it ‘the mastery brain.’ but here’s the thing: as we began to dream bigger, learn quicker and raise our levels of creativity, productivity and performance, the ancient brain and the mastery brain began a conflict. they went to war. the primitive brain senses our growth, knows we’re leaving our safe harbor of the known and gets fired up because we’re leaving our traditional ways of being. it senses the threat—even though the threat is essential to our personal ascension and professional advancement. we absolutely must venture into those unexplored places where possibility lives to become more intimate with our primal genius and to become all we are meant to be. knowing we have higher reaches of talent and courage left to visit floods a human heart with immense excitement. this knowledge is one of the vast treasures that make life worth living. the celebrated psychologist abraham maslow once stated, ‘if you plan on being anything less than who you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life.’ but the amygdala kicks into high gear as we exit what’s familiar and try something new. the vagus nerve gets provoked, the fear hormone cortisol gets released. and we begin to destroy the very intentions and implementations that our mastery brain so intelligently wants us to realize.” “this explains why so few people are highly creative and extremely productive,” the artist observed. “as we leave our comfort zones, the ancient brain gets triggered. as we raise our expertise and lift our influence, it gets frightened by the change.” “exactly,” applauded mr. riley. “then cortisol is released, our perception narrows, our breathing grows shallow and we drop into fight-or-flight mode. actually, the three options of fear are flight, fight or freeze.” the artist added, “our higher thinking wants us to grow, evolve, do more masterful work, lead better lives and inspire the world,” continued the artist. “but there’s a battle of our brains going on. and the ancient, lower—more primitive—brain inside all of us wants to stop our evolution.” “exactly,” said the billionaire as he fist-bumped the painter. “and so, speaking to the second focus of history-makers on the model you’re walking us through—freedom from distraction—i guess it’s because of this fear we face that we embrace as many diversions as possible to make us feel better, even if only for a minute?” questioned the entrepreneur. “truth,” confirmed the billionaire. “and to escape the discomfort that comes with us becoming more intimate with our inherent genius.” “this is such a big piece for me.” the artist couldn’t contain his enthusiasm. “you’ve just walked us through why our culture is so addicted to distractions. and why the majority don’t experience their greatness. and i guess that’s why creative and productive people are the real warriors of our society. we not only have to face the insults of our naysayers and the arrows of those critics who don’t understand our art, we also need to have the guts to push past the alarm bells of our ancient brains pleading with us not to reach for our brilliance.” “poetically said, my friend!” exclaimed the billionaire gleefully. he did that little dance again. the housekeeper, who was sweeping the veranda, just shook her head. “it takes an awesome amount of courage to feel the terror of true personal and professional growth—and to keep going—even when you sort of feel you’re dying,” taught the titan. “but continuing when you’re frightened is how you become a legend. you two cats are makers, builders of great things. and all builders consistently break through their fear, daily, to find higher levels of prowess, impact and human freedom. oh—and the fantastic reward you’ll receive as you fully express your strengths and gifts isn’t only the product of your heroic efforts. it’s who you’ll become by advancing through the fire of your fears and the heat of your trials along the process to mastery. you get to know who you are, you see your abilities more clearly, your confidence soars, you need the stroking of the crowd a lot less and you begin to live your authentic life versus a plastic"
sharma,"one manufactured by a world that doesn’t want you to be free.” the billionaire sipped from his water bottle before continuing to explain the importance of breaking free from the death grip of device distraction and digital diversions. “and that’s where being a member of the am club can also work its magic for you,” he told his audience of two. “one of the ways the great men and women of the world avoided complexity was by incorporating tranquility and serenity into the front part of their days. this beautiful discipline gave them absolutely essential time away from overstimulation to savor life itself, replenish their creative reservoirs, develop their supreme selves, count their blessings and ground the virtues that they would then live out their days under. many of the people who fueled the progress of our civilization shared the habit of rising before daybreak.” “could you name a few of those people?” quizzed the entrepreneur. “john grisham, the famous novelist, for one,” replied the billionaire. “other celebrated early risers include wolfgang amadeus mozart, georgia o’keeffe, frank lloyd wright and ernest hemingway, who said that early in the morning ‘there is no one to disturb you and it is cool or cold and you come to your work and warm as you write.’” “beethoven rose at dawn,” said the artist. “the great ones all spent a lot of time alone,” offered the billionaire. “solitude—the kind that you can access before the sun comes up—is a force multiplier around your power, expertise and connection to being human. and your escalation requires your isolation. see, you can be in the world all day long chatting endlessly on your phone about one thousand senseless things or you can change the world by exploiting your talent, refining your skills and being a light of upliftment that raises us all. but you can’t do both. princeton psychologist eldar shafir has used the term ‘cognitive bandwidth’ to explain the point that we have a limited amount of mental capacity when we rise each morning. and as we give our attention to numerous influences—ranging from the news, messages and online platforms to our families, our work, our fitness and our spiritual lives—we leave bits of our focus on each activity we pursue. massively important insight to consider. no wonder most of us have trouble concentrating on important tasks by noon. we’ve spent our bandwidth. sophie leroy, a business professor at the university of minnesota, calls the concentration we deposit on distraction and other stimuli ‘attention residue.’ she’s found that people are far less productive when they are constantly interrupting themselves by shifting from one task to another throughout the day because they leave valuable pieces of their attention on too many different pursuits. the solution is exactly what i’m suggesting: work on one high-value activity at a time instead of relentlessly multitasking—and do so in a quiet environment. albert einstein made the point exquisitely when he wrote, ‘only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master. for this reason, mastery demands all of a person.’ this really is one of the most closely guarded secrets of the virtuosos and history-makers. they don’t diffuse their cognitive bandwidth. they don’t dilute their creative gifts chasing every shiny diversion and every attractive opportunity that comes their way. no, instead they exercise the fierce discipline required to do only a few things—but at an absolutely world-class level. it’s like i said before: the great ones understand that it’s far smarter to create one piece of art—a genuine masterpiece—that endures for generations rather than thousands of projects that express no genius. and please also remember: the hours that the % waste the top % treasure . am is the time of least distraction, highest human glory and greatest peace. so leverage the victory hour well. you’ll make quantum leaps in your productivity as well as in your personal mastery. i don’t want to get too much further into the neuroscience i’ve shared this morning, and i have an amazing surprise planned. but there is one more concept that i’d love to share with you two. it’s called ‘transient hypofrontality.’” “transient what a whatta?” queried the artist as he laughed. the billionaire walked over to a towering palm tree with a thick trunk revealing its vast age. a sun-bleached wooden table with a wide circular top sat under it. a model had been meticulously carved into the wood. you would have been most impressed—and fascinated—if you saw it. the magnate cleared his throat and chugged some of the lemon tea. after a few seconds, he began to gargle. yes, gargle. then he carried on his discourse. “when you’re up early and all alone, away from the overstimulation and noise, your attention isn’t being fragmented by technology, meetings and other forces that can limit maximum productivity,” mused the billionaire. “and so the prefrontal cortex, that part of your brain responsible for rational thinking—as well as constant worrying—actually shuts off for a short time. lovely information, right? that’s the ‘transient’ part of transient hypofrontality. it happens only temporarily. your nonstop analyzing, ruminating and stressful overthinking stops. you pause from trying to figure everything out and being so concerned about things that will probably never happen. your brain waves actually shift from their usual beta to alpha, and sometimes even down into theta state. the solitude, silence and stillness of daybreak also triggers the production of neurotransmitters like dopamine, the inspirational fuel that serves superproducers so well, and serotonin, the beautiful pleasure drug of the brain. automatically and naturally, you enter what i described earlier as ‘the flow state.’ mr. riley waved his left hand over the diagram on the table. it looked like this: “the flow state is the peak mindset that all exceptionalists like top violinists, iconic athletes, elite chefs, brilliant scientists, empire-building entrepreneurs and legendary leaders inhabit when they produce their finest product,” the industrialist added enthusiastically. “when you give yourself the gift"
sharma,"of some morning peace away from your busyness, the hardwired capacity of every human brain to access the realm of pure genius becomes activated. the excellent news for you two cats is that with the right moves, you can habituate this state of awesome performance so it shows up with absolute predictability.” “transient hypofrontality. a very helpful model,” declared the entrepreneur as she gingerly placed her phone into her shorts. “the entire world would transform if people knew this information,” pronounced the artist. “they should be teaching all this to kids in schools,” the entrepreneur suggested. “so true,” agreed the billionaire. “but, again, i need to give all the credit for this philosophy i’m sharing with you—and the transformational methodology that i’ll soon walk you through so you implement all this potent information—to the spellbinder. he’s been my greatest teacher. and with zero doubt, the finest human being i know. ingenuity without integrity isn’t so impressive to me. unusual accomplishment free of uncommon compassion is senseless. and, yes, if every person on the planet was educated in this material and then they had the commitment to apply it, the entire world would be advanced. because each of us would own and then live our latent power to realize extraordinary results. and rise into completely glorious people.” history-maker focus #: personal mastery practice the billionaire walked his two students past the expansive terrace that offered delightful views of the ocean around to the front of his house. a black suv shimmered in the driveway, as the rays of the morning sun washed over it. “where are we going?” asked the entrepreneur. “well, i promised you both at that dramatic meeting we had at the conference that you would swim with the dolphins if you came to visit me in mauritius. so, i’m delivering on my promise. we’re going to the western part of the island, to a small seaside village called flic-en-flac. two young and delightful dudes are waiting there for us. they’re skilled at finding where the dolphins are. get ready to be blown away by what you’re about to experience, my friends. this will be unforgettable for you.” the suv was soon veering through the charming pocket-sized towns that surrounded the compound of the industrialist and rolling onto a perfectly kept highway. the billionaire sat in the front with his driver, asking about his children, his latest fascinations and his aspirations for the future. throughout the journey, mr. riley would ask a thoughtful question, then lean back and listen carefully. one could see he was a man of towering depth. with a mammoth heart. as the vehicle eased up to a lovely harbor, graced by a sandy beach, a few white cottages, a quaint fish restaurant and many aging boats moored in the water, a rooster proudly sang his morning anthem. and the miraculous sight of a double rainbow unfolded across the magnificent blue sky. two young fishermen greeted the billionaire with hugs. the group then set off into the vast indian ocean, searching for a school of dolphins they could swim and play with. the song “strength of a woman” by jamaican singer shaggy blasted from an inexpensive speaker roughly installed into the side of the boat with gray duct tape. the spray coming off the motorboat as it struck the waves soaked the faces of the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist, making them giggle like children dancing in puddles left after the rain. after a few attempts, dolphins were spotted swimming jubilantly in a small cove surrounded by soaring cliffs, the kind you’d see along the pacific coast highway in california. the way those creatures rejoiced as they glided through the ocean would make you feel as if there were a thousand of them in that little inlet. but there were only about eleven or so. the billionaire threw on a diving mask and quickly slipped into the water from a platform at the back of the motor boat. “c’mon, cats,” he said excitedly. “let’s go!” the entrepreneur went in next, her eyes alive and her heart beating with an elation she hadn’t accessed since her youth. her breathing sounded shallow and rapid through her snorkel. it sounded like hooosh, hooosh . the artist followed, doing a belly flop off the end of the boat. guided by one of the young fishermen, who was wearing surf shorts with a colorful tropical print and sporting rubber shoes, the three adventurers frolicked with the dolphins as they swam smoothly just below the water’s surface. when the dolphins descended, so did their three euphoric companions. when they would twirl around, so would the members of the am club. when they would flirt with one another, so would the entrepreneur and the artist. the experience only lasted about fifteen minutes. but it was miraculous. “that was unbelievable,” exuded the artist breathlessly as he emerged from the water and struggled to get back into the boat from the small stage near the motor. “one of the most amazing experiences of my life,” gushed the entrepreneur, as she kissed him lavishly. the billionaire soon surfaced. he was hooting with laughter. “boy, that was a blast!” on returning to the harbor, the morning mentoring class resumed on the beach, next to a pile of stones that locals used for barbecuing fish. the double rainbow remained extended across the sweeping sky. the billionaire lifted a hand toward the heavens. four white doves appeared abruptly, out of nowhere. then a cluster of pink and yellowish butterflies sailed by. “good,” announced the tycoon as he stared at them. after letting out a few throaty coughs that also seemed to come out of nowhere, he proceeded to point to the third area of the focuses of history-makers model he’d been walking his two students through on this particular day. it had “personal mastery practice” printed on it. “what are we talking about here?” wondered the artist, his dreadlocks dripping and his thick tattooed arms around the entrepreneur"
sharma,"to keep her warm. she was shivering. “training the best parts of you,” was the straightforward reply. “remember the spartan warrior credo that the spellbinder shared at the seminar? ‘sweat more in practice, bleed less in war.’ well, the quality of your morning practice determines the caliber of your daily performance. battles are won in the early light of intense training—when no one’s watching. victories occur before warriors walk onto the field. triumph belongs to the one who prepares the most. it’s obvious that if you want to be the best in the world at business or art or chess or as a designer or as a mechanic or as a manager, you need to put in enormous amounts of practice time to advance your expertise. specifically, a performer must invest at least two hours and forty-four minutes of daily improvement on their chosen skill for ten years, as preeminent psychologist anders ericsson of florida state university has taught us through his groundbreaking research. this is the minimum viable amount of practice required for the first signs of genius to appear within any domain. yet so few of us think of the importance of putting what amounts to ten thousand hours of training into becoming better human beings . and that’s why so few among us unlock that code which, once cracked, liberates our sovereign selves with all the wisdom, creativity, bravery, love and inner peace that comes with that manifestation. it’s only when we improve that our lives improve, know what i mean? what i’m suggesting to you two is that you need to practice advancing toward personal mastery daily, just as we must dedicate ourselves to any other skill we seek to be world-class at. fortify and bulletproof and nourish the core dimensions of your inner life and, trust me, you’ll x your life. everything you do in your outer world is an absolute consequence of what’s happening within you. this is where you need to do the real morning preparation. then you’ll walk out into the world every day thinking, feeling and producing at levels that make you unconquerable. you owe this gift to yourself.” “i’ve never believed much in self-improvement before the spellbinder’s conference,” stated the entrepreneur flatly. “it’s never seemed real to me.” “have you ever tried it? i mean seriously practiced it over an extended period of time?” asked the billionaire, firmly. yet another dove flew overhead. and when the mogul glanced up at the sun, it almost appeared that the clouds parted. “not really,” admitted the entrepreneur. “until now. until i joined the am club.” “okay. good. so, let’s keep going. here’s the key,” said the billionaire. “during your victory hour, from to am each morning, concentrate on upgrading what the spellbinder calls the interior empires . this will be the smartest, and sometimes the most difficult, work you will ever do in your life. deeply working on you. cultivating the four central inner arenas that i’ll walk you through in a moment is your golden key to transformation. it won’t be easy—i need to reinforce that. but it will be totally worth it.” “why?” wondered the entrepreneur. she’d stopped shaking from the cold water of the indian ocean. but the artist still held her. his dreadlocks still dripped. and the renegade rooster still crowed. “because inner empires need to be unfolded up to world-class before you’ll ever see outer ones. and your fortune always follows your fearlessness. powerful insight, cats: your influence in the world mirrors the glory, nobility, vitality and luminosity you’ve accessed in yourself . very few people in this time of superficiality and human creatures behaving like artificial machines remember this essential life truth. external always expresses internal, without always reflects within. your creativity, productivity, prosperity, performance and impact on the planet are always a sublime expression of what’s going on inside of you. for example, if you lack faith in your ability to get your ambitions done, you’ll never achieve them. if you don’t feel deserving of abundance, you’ll never do what’s required to realize it. and if your drive to capitalize on your genius is weak, your fire to train is dim and your stamina to optimize is low, it’s clear you’ll never take flight into the rare-air of outright mastery. and realize domain dominance. external always expresses internal. and to experience empires in your outer life you need to develop your inner ones first,” reinforced the billionaire. he started to sip from a bottle of green-colored liquid that one of the fishermen had given him when he hopped out of the motor boat. if you looked very closely at the text printed on the glass, you’d read these words of mahatma gandhi: “the only devils in the world are those running in our own hearts. that is where the battle should be fought.” “as you consistently increase the inherent power inside you,” mr. riley continued, “you’ll actually begin to see an alternate reality flush with gorgeous opportunity and luxurious possibility. you’ll play in a universe of the marvelous that members of the majority can’t even perceive. because their eyes are blinded by doubt, disbelief and fear. greatness is an inside game,” the billionaire affirmed as he drew yet another learning model into the sand. it looked like this: “okay, let’s go granular on this framework so you cats have a high and ultra-clear awareness of what aspects of your inner life to improve during your victory hour. i’ll provide you with the complete morning routine to run soon, when i teach the // formula . for now, please just know that there are four interior empires to train, cultivate and iterate before the sun comes up: mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset. together, these four private arenas form the foundation of the true primal power that rests inside every human being alive today. most of us have disowned and discredited this formidable force as we’ve spent our days pursuing things outside ourselves. but we all have this"
sharma,"profound and illustrious capacity within us. and the best time to optimize your four interior empires is from to am . that’s the most special time of the day. own your morning, and you’ll elevate your life,” encouraged the tycoon. “oh, a question: what if i only want to do this five days a week and take weekends off? how strict is this whole am method?” asked the entrepreneur. an ancient dog shuffled by and the song “occhi,” by italian music legend zucchero, could be heard playing from the fish restaurant. you would probably have found that part of this scene quite strange. but it really did happen this way. “it’s your life. do what fits you best and feels right to you. what i’m revealing is the information the spellbinder shared with me. it caused me to make my fortune. and helped me find a consummate sense of daily joy and ongoing peace. really, all of this gave me personal freedom. apply it all in whatever way works for your values, aspirations and lifestyle. yet also know that part-time commitment truly does deliver part-time results ,” stated the billionaire as he turned to catch a fly with his fist. “could you please go deeper into the interior empires ?” the entrepreneur asked. “this piece you’re teaching us will really help me become a lot stronger in my fight with those investors and get even more of my hope, happiness and confidence back. i haven’t told you this, but over these past days since i met you, i’ve been applying so much of what you’ve been so generous to share with us. as i’m sure you saw, at first i resisted a lot of the spellbinder’s philosophies. i really didn’t want to go to his seminar, you know. but at least i was open to his—and your—teachings. desperately open. i love life, you know. and i now plan to live a long time.” “good,” the artist said as he picked up a heart-shaped seashell and placed it tenderly into a palm of the entrepreneur. he closed her fingers around it. and pressed her hand to his chest. “i’m already noticing some significant improvements,” the entrepreneur went on. “by rising at five, i feel more focused, less stressed, more secure and way more energetic. i have a larger sense of perspective over all the aspects of my life. i’m becoming more grateful for all the positive in my world, a lot less concerned with the attack on my company and a lot more excited about my future. look, those investors are bad guys. and i’m not ready to handle them yet. i will, though. but the fear i felt around the whole thing, and the dark sense of hopelessness about it all, well, that’s faded.” “neato,” said the billionaire using the vintage slang of hipsters of a bygone era. he then changed his t-shirt on the beach. the suv had returned, and the driver was parked directly in front of the seafood restaurant. “and you’re wise,” the billionaire added. “all this information is priceless. but—as you’re finding—it’s the ceaseless practice and daily application of it that will make you a heroic human being and an inspirational leader in business and a worldwide uplifter of many. and i congratulate you for letting go of your past. no one’s suggesting you act irresponsibly and not deal with the issue you’re facing at your firm. but your past is a place to be learned from, not a home to be lived in .” the three friends climbed into the waiting vehicle and it pushed ahead to return to the estate of the eclectic host. “so, let’s talk more about this learning model, because it is so crucial to your success and happiness,” the billionaire commented as the suv sailed along. “many gurus speak of mindset. they teach the importance of installing the psychology of possibility, to use harvard psychologist ellen langer’s phrase. they coach you to think optimistic thoughts every day. these teachers tell you that your thinking forms your reality and that, by improving your mind, you’ll improve your life. for sure, calibrating your mindset is an essential move to make toward the personal mastery that will then lead to a legendary outer reality. “yet,” the billionaire continued, “and it’s incredibly important that you two understand this because most people don’t: the spellbinder taught me that elevating your mindset—the first of the four interior empires—is only % of the personal mastery equation.” “seriously?” the artist asked. “i always thought that our thinking determines everything. that there wasn’t much more to it than that. the whole ‘change your thinking and you’ll change your life’ and your ‘attitude determines your altitude’ kind of thing.” “look,” said the billionaire. “it’s definitely true that your deepest beliefs drive your daily behavior. you know i believe that. and you know i also agree that the way you perceive the world drives the way you perform in it. yet, a superbly developed mindset without a magnificently purified heartset is a hollow triumph. just working on your mindset will never deliver the fullness of your sovereignty and fully express your resident genius,” the industrialist said with great clarity. “i think i’m getting you,” noted the artist with a grin the size of mount kilimanjaro. “charles bukowski said, ‘stop insisting on clearing your head … clear your heart instead.’” “he was right,” agreed the billionaire as he relaxed deeper into his rich leather seat in the suv. “so, help me understand exactly what ‘heartset’ is?” asked the entrepreneur. she was watching a group of school kids running in a playground with unsparing exhilaration. her thoughts drifted to her childhood. “heartset is your emotional life. even with battleproofed beliefs and the distinguished thinking of a world-class mindset, you won’t win if your heart is full of anger, sadness, disappointment, resentment and fear. just think about it: how can you produce amazing work and realize astonishing results if toxic feelings are weighing you"
sharma,"down? it seems like everyone’s talking about building a healthy and undefeatable mindset these days. you hear it everywhere. but no one’s speaking of heartset—or healthset and soulset. all four of these interior empires must be polished beautifully through morning practice for you to know the awe-inspiring power that lurks within you. and it’s only when you grow and deepen your relationship with this natural authority that exists at your core that you can ascend into the company of the virtuosos. and the gods. as you elevate your four interior empires, you’ll begin to achieve success in the external world at a level you’ve never believed you could achieve. and more elegantly than you’ve ever imagined. it’s as if you’ve developed the capabilities of a magic worker. you start to increase the power of others, by your very presence. an improbable yet consistently reliable stream of miracles will infuse your common hours. and a prolific joyfulness born of brilliant accomplishment and worldwide service will come to you, as life’s reward for the admirable ways you’ve behaved.” mr. riley looked out of the vehicle’s window. he then continued his discourse. “so many of us know what we should do mentally but nothing extraordinary ever happens because our emotional life remains a mess. we stay stuck in the past. we haven’t forgiven the unforgiven. we’ve repressed all those unhealthy emotions from all that has hurt us. sigmund freud wrote that ‘unexpressed emotions will never die. they are buried alive and they will come forth later in uglier ways.’ and we wonder why our attempts at positive thinking aren’t working! what i’m sharing with you explains why so many self-improvement books don’t lead to lasting evolution. and why so few conferences make an enduring difference. our intellectual intentions are good. we really wish to become brighter producers and better people. but we merely get the information at the level of thought. and then we sabotage our lofty aspirations with the residue of our broken hearts. so, nothing shifts. so, nothing increases. so, nothing transforms . if you want to experience exponential growth and unparalleled performance you need to dial in a masterful mindset but also repair, rebuild and reinforce a winning heartset. so that all the dark and toxic emotion from your past pains are cleared out. released and cleansed and purified. forever. and so your heart, once hardened by life’s trials, reopens in all its noble glory.” “amazing insights,” the entrepreneur acknowledged. “but how exactly do i do this during my victory hour from to am ?” “you’ll learn how to implement the am method in the near future,” the billionaire replied. “you two cats are becoming open enough and strong enough to embrace the // formula soon. and like i’ve suggested since we’ve hung together, your lives will never be the same once you know and run it. the // formula is an absolute game-changer. for now, please just understand that a great mindset with a poor heartset is a giant reason good people end up dissolving their attempts at greatness. “oh,” added the billionaire. “i should also mention that working on your heartset isn’t only about removing negative emotions that have built up from life’s frustrations, disappointments and burdens. it’s also about amplifying the healthy ones. that’s why part of your morning routine needs to have a gratitude practice as part of it. to feed your sense of awe and fuel your reservoirs of exuberance.” “love it,” said the artist. “profound what you’re sharing, brother. revolutionary, i’ll admit,” he emphasized. “yes. absolutely. and so the spellbinder taught me to do some profound work on my heartset each morning, during my victory hour. yet here’s the thing: even upgrading your heartset along with growing your mindset before the first rays of the sun display themselves still means you’re only doing % of the personal mastery work required to materialize the interior empires that will yield the outer empires of your highest wishes. after mindset and heartset, you also need to fortify your healthset each morning.” “new word for me,” observed the entrepreneur. “healthset. i like it.” “well, this one speaks to your physical dimension,” explained the billionaire as the suv passed one of the many tea plantations in mauritius. “one of the main elements of your rise to legendary is longevity. here’s a quick tip if you want to lead your field and experience continuous escalations of your eminence: do not die . you’ll never become a titan of your industry and an icon who makes history if you’re dead.” both the entrepreneur and the artist grinned as the billionaire began to clap vigorously, apparently as happy as a family of squirrels playing in a forest, on hearing his own words. “but i am being serious. beautiful things happen once you commit seriously to peak fitness and go hard on cheating aging. just imagine living an extra few decades—and staying ultra-healthy as you do so. that’s another few decades to refine your craft, to grow into an even more influential leader, to produce work that’s radical artistry, to compound your prosperity and to build a luminous legacy that will enrich all of humanity. epic producers and great leaders understand that you just can’t rise to mastery without leveraging—and then armor-plating—your vitality. every day’s just dramatically better with some exercise in it. i need to say that again because it’s so essential to a life amazingly lived: every day is just dramatically better with some exercise in it. and few things feel as good as getting uber-fit. i guess what i’m offering to you is that healthset is all about dialing in your physical dimension so your brain is operating at its highest level of cognition and so your energy is igniting and so your stress is dissolving and so your joy is expanding. getting really healthy and ultra-fit worked wonders for my business, you know?” the billionaire paused. he drew his hands together as is the custom in india, where people"
sharma,"say “namaste,” which is sanskrit for “i bow to the divine in you.” “and that brings me to soulset, lady and gentleman. i have learned that every single one of us has an unstained spirit and spotless soulfulness that rests at our very center. most of the world is uninterested in whispers from and the requirements of the soul. as a race, we’ve neglected that portion of ourselves that is most wise, wonderful and eternal. the majority, programmed by society, is all about getting the goods that will boost popularity, gaining validation and social currency from their selfies and accomplishing popular results that will give them legitimacy. however, feeding your spirit—daily—is the activity of genuine leadership royalty.” “and tell me, mr. riley, when you refer to soulset, what exactly are you speaking of?” inquired the entrepreneur, clearly making steady progress as a student of the spellbinder’s teachings. she also appeared more present, strong and free than at any time since the artist had met her. “yeah—i’m not clear either, brother,” mentioned the artist sincerely as he, too, reclined in his seat as the chauffeur navigated the vehicle up the winding driveway of the tycoon’s home. more butterflies floated by. the double rainbow remained transfixed in the sky. the billionaire peered at it and then went on. “‘there is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportions,’” observed the billionaire as he waved to his gardeners and stuck his tongue out at a frog. “the english poet christopher marlowe said that. and, dude, he was speaking some truth there. anyhoo, to help you understand the fourth interior empire, please allow me to bring this learning all together by simply saying that since mindset is all about your psychology and heartset is all about your emotionality, and healthset relates to your physiology, soulset refers to your spirituality. that’s it. nothing mystical, really. nothing religious. nothing voodoo or freaky.” “go deeper, please,” pressed the entrepreneur. “you’re reordering my perception with all of these points.” “well, it’s all the spellbinder’s work, not mine, kindly remember that. anyhoo, my encouragement is to become a devout spiritualist. and just so that term doesn’t spook you—and shut you down to this education—all i mean to say is spend some time in the quietude of the early morning to make the return to the courage, conviction and compassion within you. all i’m encouraging is that you soar with the angels of your highest nature and dance with the gods of your most precious talents for a little time before sunrise, as a tribute to what’s most wise and true within you. only then will you begin to know—and understand—the shangri-las of greatness and nirvanas of light that inhabit your sovereign self. soulset is all about remembering who you truly are. the sages, saints and seers of history all rose at dawn to forge even weightier bonds with the hero we all have at our cores. insecurity, scarcity, selfishness and unhappiness are all children of fear. these characteristics were taught to you. they sure aren’t your natural state. after we are born, we begin the departure from our spiritual power and descend into more of what this damaged world wants us to be. we become more about acquiring, hoarding and comparing instead of creating, helping and adventuring. awake human beings work on elevating their soulset in the serene hours before daybreak, in the sanctuary of solitude, silence and stillness. through hope-filled contemplation of the finest version of yourself, without errors in your character. by marvelous meditation on how you wish to show up during the day ahead. by thoughtful consideration of the quickness of life and the suddenness of the exit. and by rich reflections on what gifts you aim to materialize so you leave the world in better shape than you encountered it, on your birth. these are some of the ways you can raise your soulset game. “yes,” continued the billionaire, the vulnerability of his open-hearted delivery displaying itself even more potently in his now soft voice. “you two have a brave, loving and wildly powerful hero at your foundation. i know to most people this idea sounds crazy. but it is truth that i speak. and by spending some time on your soulset during your victory hour, you’ll improve your awareness of—and relationship with—this most magnificent part of you. so you are consistently serving society instead of gratifying the ego hungers of your smaller self.” “and with better daily awareness of our mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset, we’ll make the better daily choices that will guarantee better daily results, right?” pronounced the entrepreneur, reciting the step success formula she’d discovered in an earlier mentoring session. “precisely,” applauded the billionaire. “exactly,” he added, nodding his head. “and please, always stay sincere to what’s most important in a life greatly lived,” pleaded the billionaire. “be not seduced by the superficialities that suffocate the human spirit and divorce us from the best within us.” he pulled a thin wallet out of a front pocket and read the words of tolstoy from a tattered piece of paper that had been folded in a sleeve. here’s what you would have heard him say in his raspy yet dignified voice, if you were in that suv with them: “a quiet secluded life in the country with the possibility of being useful to people to whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one’s neighbor—such is my idea of happiness.” the three companions were now standing outside the magnate’s house. an owl was perched on a lemon tree. it hooted terrifically as it saw the billionaire. he replied with a simple wave. “nice to see you, buddy,” the billionaire said. “what took you so long to come home?” history-maker focus #: day stacking “remember that each of your prized days represents your precious life in"
sharma,"miniature,” the billionaire observed. “as you live each day, so you craft your life. we all are so focused on pursuing our futures that we generally ignore the exceedingly important value of a single day. and yet what we are doing today is creating our future. it’s like that sailboat over there,” expounded mr. riley, pointing to a water craft off in the distance. “a few navigational shifts, seemingly irrelevant and infinitesimal, when done consistently over a long voyage, make the difference between ending up in breathtaking brazil or fantastic japan. all you need to do to pretty much guarantee a hugely successful and a splendidly meaningful life is own the day. make those % course corrections and improvements over each twenty-four-hour allotment you receive, and these days will slip into weeks and your weeks into months and your months will slip into your years. the spellbinder called such daily personal and professional optimizations ‘micro-wins.’ enhancing anything in your day, ranging from your morning routine to a thought pattern to a business skill to a personal relationship, by only % delivers at least a %— yes, % —elevation only a month from starting. stay with the program and, in just one year, the pursuit you’ve been focusing on has elevated %, at least. the main point i’m making here is concentrate monomaniacally on creating great days—and they’ll stack into a gorgeous life.” “small daily, seemingly insignificant improvements, when done consistently over time, yield staggering results,” reinforced the entrepreneur, recalling one of the brain tattoos she’d been schooled in during this magical adventure. “yes,” declared the billionaire cheerfully, as he stretched and then touched his toes while whispering to himself, “life is good, and i must help these two kind souls become great—before it’s too late.” “here’s the real takeaway,” the billionaire carried on. “elite producers and everyday heroes understand that what you do each day matters far more than what you do once in a while. consistency really is a key ingredient of mastery. and regularity is a necessity if you’re amped to make history. ” in that moment, the entrepreneur’s attention was stolen by her phone as the screen lit up. stunningly, the following words showed up in lettering that resembled blood dripping, leaving her trembling and shaken: a killer is coming “baby—what’s up?” asked the artist, revealing more of the growing intimacy of their relationship. “yes—what happened?” wondered the billionaire on seeing the ghost-white face of the entrepreneur. “it’s … um… it’s … well … it’s …” she sputtered. she fell to her knees, in a flower bed close to where the chauffeur had parked the suv. almost as quickly, she stood up again. “it’s another death threat. they’re telling me someone is on the way to kill me. the investors again. pushing me to leave the firm. guess what, guys?” the entrepreneur said, pivoting into a posture of high confidence and mighty defiance. “ i’m not leaving . i built this company. i love what i do. i would do anything for my team. our products are incredible. and growing the enterprise has given me great fulfillment. i’m ready to fight them. let’s go! bring it on, i say!” “it’s being handled,” murmured the billionaire, echoing what he’d said at his beach, on first learning about the situation. “just stay fully present to the teaching you’re learning and this special opportunity of being a new member of the am club. keep having a blast here with me in mauritius. continue this little love story unfolding between you and my tattooed friend over here,” smiled the billionaire. “and keep strengthening the awareness of your natural power, as a leader, performer and human being. i’m really happy to see your progress. you already seem braver, lighter and much more peaceful. good on you.” “getting up at am is getting easier as each day passes,” the entrepreneur said, feeling comforted and sounding composed. “the insights you’re sharing are valuable. i’m growing a lot. i can’t wait to go granular on how to make the habit stick and learn the // formula so i know exactly what to do during my victory hour. i’ve been practicing some yoga and walking along the sea in the darkness before the sun comes up, yet i’d love some help on a more specific ritual. i know you have one. but the philosophy, so far, has been remarkably helpful.” “the precise methodology is coming soon. at this point i simply want you to know that the concept i’ve just shared with you both is called the day stacking foundation . winning definitely does start at your beginning. own your morning and the quality of your day rises exponentially which, in turn, upgrades the calibre of your life exceptionally. you’ll be so much more energetic, productive, confident, excellent, happy and serene—even on the most difficult of days, when you calibrate the front end of it. okay, now you two go and have an amazing day together. i love the words of the poet john keats, who wrote: ‘i almost wish we were butterflies and lived but three summer days—three such days with you i could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain.’ pretty great, right?” “totally,” voiced the artist as he tugged on three dreadlocks, patted his stomach and then laced up a black combat boot. “totally agree.” “and what time should we meet tomorrow, cool cats?” inquired the billionaire, with a look that confirmed he was quite sure of the answer. “ am ,” the entrepreneur and the artist replied enthusiastically, in unison. oceanofpdf.com c hapter navigating the tides of life “the best and most beautiful things in this world cannot be seen or even heard, but must be felt with the heart.” —helen keller the entrepreneur had learned to sail as a child. she’d loved the sensation of salt water on her young face and the feelings of freedom that being out on the vast sea brought her spirit. she"
sharma,"wondered why she had stopped sailing. in that instant, she also considered why she’d given up so many of the pursuits that had brought her such harmony. and she cherished the fact that in this basic moment, in a small boat gliding through the endless indian ocean, she was truly open. and wildly alive. “our culture measures success by how much money we have, the amount of achievement we complete, and how much influence we reach. yet,” thought the entrepreneur, “while both the spellbinder and mr. riley agree that those victories are important, they’ve encouraged me to consider how well i’m running my life by another series of metrics as well. by my connection with my natural power and by my intimacy with my authenticity and by the vitality around my physicality and by the size of my joy. this seems like a much better way to look at success. being both accomplished in the world yet peaceful within myself.” her time at the spellbinder’s conference and her wonderful days here on this pristine island with people who still took the time to say “good morning,” smile at strangers and show genuine warmth continued to inspire and provoke both tiny and large shifts in her understanding of the true nature of a productive, prosperous and fulfilling life. the entrepreneur was noticing she was becoming less machine-like and more human. she no longer checked her technology compulsively. she couldn’t remember feeling so creative, so available to the miraculous wonders of life. she’d never been so awake to the blessings every day on earth brings. and she’d never, or at least she couldn’t recall a time when she had, felt so thankful. yes, utterly appreciative—for everything she’d experienced. she realized the hard points of her life had strengthened her and made her more insightful, interesting and wise. a fascinating and richly colorful life is stamped with many scars, she began to understand. she promised herself that she’d exploit the challenge she was facing with her investors to raise her grade of courage. the partners’ takeover attempt would simply escalate her commitment to defending the natural heroism she’d learned we all have within us, at our center beneath the layers of fear, insecurity and limitation that we all collect as we advance through life. the behaviors of her untrustworthy partners would only serve to make her a braver, better and more decent person. often, a bad example teaches us more about who we wish to become than a good one could ever provide. and, in this world of so many hardened human beings who have lost access to who they truly are, she vowed to conduct the remainder of her days modeling excellence, resilience and the utmost of kindness. as the entrepreneur and the artist navigated their little wooden vessel through the waters that were as clear as crystal, around coral that could be brutal if struck and farther away from the beach where the billionaire had delivered his morning instruction, the entrepreneur spotted the distant land mass where mr. riley suggested she and her new love have a picnic. she also detected an ever-growing affection for the large man who sat next to her. though they came from entirely different universes, their chemistry was undeniable. it was as if galaxies had collided. and though they had different ways of operating, their compatibility was as nothing she’d experienced before. her mother had once told her that if you are fortunate enough to fall in love even two or three times within a lifetime, make each of these stories count fully. her companion’s artistic powers intrigued her. his desire to be great on his own terms attracted her. his occasional hard edges challenged her. his sense of humor amused her. his palpable compassion moved her. and his dark eyes melted her. “this was a good idea,” the artist said as the entrepreneur adjusted the set of the sail and skillfully directed the boat around some buoys placed there by early morning fishermen. “to come out here—away from everything. i needed a break from the learning. i’m loving all the information. i’m getting so much from mr. riley. man, he’s a treasure. but my head is full. i don’t want to think for a while. i just want to have some fun and enjoy life. being out here, with you, is special.” “thanks,” replied the entrepreneur simply as her hair waved playfully in the wind and her sparkling eyes stayed fixed on the water in front of her. “this is the happiest i’ve seen her look since i met her at the conference,” thought the artist. he put an arm around the entrepreneur. she didn’t retreat in any way, remaining relaxed as their brightly painted vessel ventured deeper into the ocean. after a while, the small island they had been heading toward came into clearer focus. “the billionaire’s team stocked us up for a pretty good picnic,” noted the entrepreneur. “how about we drop anchor in the shallow area over there and have lunch on the white sand part of the beach?” the island looked deserted aside from the well-fed seagulls, some with live fish dangling from their skinny yellow beaks, that soared overhead. and the gigantic turtle ambling along the damp shoreline as though he ruled it. “cool,” the artist replied. “i’m good with that,” he added as he took off his shirt unselfconsciously and dove into the water with a wide splash. the delightful meal the two enjoyed consisted of grilled spicy prawn and a fresh mango salad, along with a humongous chunk of pecorino cheese flown in that morning from italy. watermelon mixed with pineapple and kiwi had been provided for dessert. the entrepreneur shared her longing to build one of the world’s greatest companies as they savored the food and relaxed in that sanctuary of peaceful isolation. she spoke of her desire to build a genuine empire and then, perhaps, to retire in style to the rustic side of ibiza. she"
sharma,"also confided even more of her pained childhood, from the terrible divorce of her parents to the depth of her trauma around the violent passage of her beloved father. she spoke in further detail of the series of failed relationships that had caused her to concentrate most of her time on her work and the loneliness she felt when she wasn’t in the process of advancing her business. “those weren’t ‘failed relationships,’” mused the artist as he munched joyfully on a chunk of watermelon. “they made you who you are, right? and i really like who you are. actually,” said the artist candidly, “i love who you are.” he leaned over and kissed the entrepreneur. “what took you so long to say that?” she asked. “i don’t know. my confidence has been low for a long time,” confessed the artist. “but hearing the spellbinder at the seminar and meeting you and feeling our amazing vibe and then being on this totally insane yet incredible adventure … i don’t know. it’s making me believe more in myself again. this is all helping me to trust life again, i guess. to open up to someone again is great. i should paint later today. something special is going to show up. i just know it.” “yes, you should,” encouraged the entrepreneur. “i sense it, too. you’re going to be a hugely successful and truly legendary painter.” and then, after a lengthy pause, she added, “i love you, too, by the way.” the romance of that moment being shared by the two new members of the am club was suddenly broken by the sound of loud hip-hop music. a figure could be seen in the water moving dazzlingly fast—zigzagging and then racing along straightaways. it soon became evident who this noisy and uninvited intruder was: stone riley, riding on a souped-up jet ski and wearing a top hat that had been strapped to his chin. yes, a top hat. and if you looked closely, you would see a skull-and-crossbones symbol on it—the sort that sits on pirate flags. soon he, too, was up on the unspoiled beach with the two lovers. soon he, too, was eating the prawns and mango salad and wolfing down large pieces of the fresh fruit dessert. and soon he was holding hands with the entrepreneur and the artist. this man was a pure oddball. and a most human hero. the entrepreneur and the artist looked at each other as the billionaire did his thing. they shook their heads, clapped their hands and laughed easy laughs. “dudes,” shouted the billionaire above the volume of the thumping music as his jet ski bobbed in the shallow water. “missed you two. hope you don’t mind me crashing your picnic,” he communicated with food in his mouth. without waiting for an answer, he turned up the decibel level of the song and sang along to the words. “gnarly tune, right?” he asked with all the energy of a power plant. “def,” replied the artist instinctively. “i mean definitely,” he corrected. the three companions spent the rest of that unforgettable afternoon swimming, singing, dancing and talking. that evening the billionaire hosted a magnificent dinner out on his beach, which was lit with tiki torches, cream-colored lanterns and what you would have guessed were thousands of candles. a long wooden table, draped with the finest of linens, supported platters of exquisitely prepared food. the spellbinder also appeared at the banquet, swapping stories with the billionaire while a few of mr. riley’s other friends showed up later to play the bongos, share in the fabulous meal and sip some fine wine. even the ultra-professional and exceptionally hospitable attendants were encouraged to join the festivities. it was all surreal. and special. for an instant, the entrepreneur reflected on the preciousness of the evening and recalled a quote her father had placed on the door of the family fridge. it was from dale carnegie, the self-help author, and it read: “one of the most tragic things i know about human nature is that all of us tend to put off living. we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today.” the entrepreneur smiled to herself. she realized she would postpone living fully no more. she’d not only fallen in love with a good man. she was beginning to experience a lavish lust for life itself. at am the next morning, the sound of a helicopter pierced the sereneness that only presents itself at that hour of the day. the entrepreneur and the artist waited on the beach as they’d promised the billionaire they would. they held hands, tightly, and awaited the next lesson he told them he’d share. but the billionaire was nowhere to be found. an assistant wearing a crisp shirt the color of the sky and pressed bermuda shorts the hue of a tomato, with red leather sandals, ran down from the home of the titan of industry. “bonjour,” she said in a highly polished way. “mr. riley has requested that i escort you to his helipad. he has a huge gift for you both. but you’ll need to hurry. please. we’re on a strict timeline.” the three of them scampered along the beach, up a groomed trail through lush trees, past an herb garden with wooden signs containing quotes from famous leaders as well as one that said “trespassers will be composted” and, finally, to an expansive manicured meadow. at the center of it sat a gleaming helicopter with its rotors whirring against the radiance of the early morning lightfall. inside the aircraft a single pilot could be seen. he wore aviator glasses, a black flat-brimmed baseball cap and an all-black uniform. as his passengers were led inside, the pilot remained silent, manipulating the controls and writing on what appeared to be a detailed checklist attached to a scuffed-up clipboard with the phrase “rise and shine so you’ll escape the"
sharma,"misery of mediocrity” written at the top in red. a smiley face emoji was evident below this line. “good morning,” said the entrepreneur enthusiastically to the pilot. “where’s mr. riley?” the pilot didn’t answer. he tuned a dial. tweaked a knob. and made another tick mark on the white page. “good luck, and have a safe flight, you two,” announced the assistant as she adjusted the seat belts and placed headphones with a microphone snuggly onto the heads of her vip guests. “where the heck are we going?” demanded the artist, reverting to angry-man status. no reply. the door shut with a thud. then locked, with a click. the engine noise grew louder, and the propeller accelerated its rotations. whoosh, whoosh whoosh , went the sound. the pilot, seemingly in some sort of imperturbable trance and certainly not at all friendly, pushed the control stick. the helicopter began to rise above the grassy field. unexpectedly, the aircraft tilted to the left dramatically. then it descended aggressively toward the earth in a freefall before jerking upward again. “total disaster,” shouted the artist. “this pilot is incompetent. i hate him.” “just breathe. all will be well,” reasoned the entrepreneur. she looked relaxed, secure and in complete control. her morning training was working. she pulled the artist closer to her. “i’m here. we’ll be safe. this will end well.” soon, the helicopter was high in the sky and moving steadily, efficiently and gracefully. the quiet pilot fiddled with the dials and tinkered with the controls, seemingly oblivious to the fact he carried two passengers. “i’ve seen that watch before,” observed the artist as he spied the big timepiece on the pilot’s lean wrist. “same one stone had on at the spellbinder’s presentation. this is nuts,” he stated in a quivering voice. the painter was sweating like a polar bear in a heatwave. “own your morning. elevate your life,” came the singing voice from the front of the helicopter. “hi, cats. bonzour. enjoying being members of the am club this morning?” he questioned in a raspy tone. “boy, oh boy, you’re gonna love the surprise that’s coming. another country for another lesson on the morning routine of legendary leaders, creative geniuses and the great women and men of the world.” the pilot turned his head around radically and whipped off his sunglasses intensely. then he let out a monumental burp. it was the billionaire. “hey, people. i didn’t mean to scare you two glorious human beings. i do have my helicopter pilot’s license, you know,” said mr. riley sincerely, almost apologetically. “sure,” remarked the artist, still clinging to the entrepreneur like a gambler holding his last chip. “got it years ago,” the billionaire continued. “helicopters are uber-cool. but with all my business ventures these days, i don’t get in the airtime i used to. sorry for the rough liftoff. i guess i need more practice.” “so where are we going?” the entrepreneur asked as she eased into her supple leather seat. “agra” was the billionaire’s one-word answer. “what does that mean?” asked the artist. “what’s an agra?” “i’m taking you guys back to the airport,” said the billionaire. “gotta keep us moving on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure we’re on.” “we’re leaving mauritius?” wondered the entrepreneur with disappointment. her bracelets dangled and knocked against each other as she said this. “what about everything you still have to share with us?” the artist asked. “we still haven’t learned the // formula you say will revolutionize our lives. you told us that it’s pretty much the foundation of the am method. i’ve been waiting to learn it,” argued the artist, punching a fist into a hand again. “and i really, really love mauritius. i wasn’t ready to leave.” “so do i,” agreed the entrepreneur. “i thought you promised us you’d get into the detailed tactics around what to do after we get up at am . and at the spellbinder’s conference you promised that you’d share practical productivity hacks so i could scale up my business and some key techniques to build my own fortune. and me and my man only had one picnic together. and you crashed it with your loud music and your pimped-up jet ski!” no one spoke for a moment. then, slowly, everyone in the helicopter began to giggle. “relax, guys!” hollered the billionaire. “my home is your home. you can come back to mauritius any time you want. i’ll send the same drivers and the same jet, and i’ll make sure you feel the same love from me and my awesome team. no sweat. happy to be helpful. always.” he adjusted another dial before adding, “i’ve got a plane waiting for us on the runway right now. you lovebirds have been tremendous students. absolutely first-rate. you’ve passionately embraced the spellbinder’s teachings. you’ve been up with the sun and on time every morning. i’ve seen all your progress. so i wanted to give you a great present today.” “a present?” the artist queried. “i’ll need to get back to my studio at home pretty soon. i’ve got some serious restructuring of my craft and fixing of my life to do after all this.” “and i’ll need to be at my company soon, too,” the entrepreneur said. some of the worry lines returned to her forehead as she pronounced these words, though there were many fewer than before she had joined the am club. “well not yet, guys. not yet—please,” pleaded the billionaire. “we’re going to agra.” “i have no idea where that is,” admitted the entrepreneur. “agra is in india,” the billionaire explained. “i’m taking you two to see one of the seven wonders of the world. and get set to learn the next part of the am method. everything you’ve learned so far has been preparation for all that’s coming. lock and load, dudes. we’re now ready to get into the advanced information to help you drive exponential productivity, maximum performance, legendary leadership and a towering life that upgrades the world. get set"
sharma,"to receive the most practical information you could ever learn on the morning routine of world-builders and history-makers. the best is about to come.” the billionaire expertly landed the helicopter next to a pristine private jet that had its turbines running. unlike the first one, this aircraft was all black. but like the one that brought the two students to mauritius, it had ac emblazoned on the tail, also in a hue of orange similar to a mandarin. “let’s go to incredible india!” exclaimed the billionaire energetically. “let’s go, then!” replied the entrepreneur and the artist. one of the most valuable experiences of their extraordinary escapade with stone riley, the eccentric magnate, was about to begin. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club discovers the habit installation protocol “i hated every minute of training. but i said, ‘don’t quit. suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.’” —muhammad ali the next morning’s lesson was scheduled to be on how the most productive leaders and performers on the planet install the habits that make them superstars. and live fascinating, adventurous and purposeful lives. in reply to mr. riley’s request, both the entrepreneur and the artist had arranged to extend their time away. they understood the profound value of the training they were being exposed to. and they knew their smartest move was to embrace it fully. “hi, cats,” shouted the billionaire, running up to his companions as the indian sun rose timidly against a horizon that was at once barren and electrifying. it was precisely am . the tycoon wore a black nehru-collared shirt, cargo shorts and black sandals. he was smiling broadly. he still glowed from the sunshine of mauritius. and, today, he wore a turban. “this morning, i’ll be walking you through the spellbinder’s insights on installing the peak performance regimes that will help you activate your greatness in business and in life. as i shared with you in an earlier lesson, what makes the best the best is not their genetics but their habits. and not the extent of their gifts, but the strength of their grit. today’s lesson will walk you through what the science and research tell us we must do to let go of the behaviors that weaken us and to code in the ones that will serve us.” “what’s grit?” asked the entrepreneur, paying attention to every word the billionaire spoke. today, she had her hair in a ponytail and simple shoes on her feet. “it’s a term popularized by social psychologist angela duckworth, who studied elite performers in the fields of business, education, the military and sports. she found that what makes the most successful achievers so great isn’t their inherent talent but their levels of commitment, discipline, resilience and perseverance. ‘grit’ is her word to describe these traits.” “cool, brother,” said the artist. “that inspires me not to give up on a painting when i hit a wall of self-doubt. or when i get frustrated by my lack of progress. or when i get scared others in my field will laugh because i’m producing art that is fresh and original instead of copied and derivative.” “good,” responded the billionaire as he rubbed his muscular abs. “albert einstein wrote ‘great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. the mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.’” “love that,” spoke the artist exuberantly, displaying an expression that showed his growing pride in trusting his personal vision when it came to his craft. “anyhoo, let’s get back on track and keep jamming on the most potent ways to install world-class habits that last versus ones that dissolve after a few weeks of trying to make them stick. of course, this morning’s mentoring class is absolutely essential for you two because, even though you guys are up at am daily now, we want the discipline to become a lifetime routine. oh, and an essential part of world-class habit installation involves learning how the pros build remarkable self-control and unleash rare-air amounts of willpower. so, we should start there.” the three companions were standing in front of the taj mahal. they were alone. the structure was unspeakably sublime as they stared at it, a genuine testimony to the rewards of architectural and engineering mastery. “i love india so much,” declared the billionaire. “one of the greatest nations on earth. and this place, well, it’s one of the seven wonders of the world for a reason. breathtakingly beautiful, right?” “true,” admitted the entrepreneur as she sipped some very hot coffee. the billionaire held a large water bottle in his left hand. it had a statement printed on it, as his water bottles often did, which he read to his two students with gusto: the hero does not become great during periods of comfort. the illustrious and noble souls of our world became strong, brave and moral whilst standing resolutely in the storms of adversity, difficulty and doubt. it is in the moment that you face your deepest weakness that you receive the chance to forge your greatest strengths. real power, then, comes not from a life of ease but one of intense effort, devoted discipline and demanding action in the direction of what your supreme self knows to be right. to continue at a time when you ache to stop. to advance when you long to quit. to persist in the instant when you feel like giving up is to claim your membership among the great warriors and honorable characters who led humanity to a better place through their earned invincibility. “wow,” uttered the artist. “some great poet wrote that?” “nope,” mentioned the billionaire. “those words are all mine.” mr. riley then raised a hand into the air—and you know what happened. out of the early morning mist appeared an impeccably dressed and very attractive aide. “we’re all so happy you’re back in india, sir."
sharma,"we have missed you,” she uttered. “here’s what you asked for.” the billionaire bowed slightly and gave his assistant a friendly smile. a spectacularly ornate pashmina shawl was handed to the titan, who stretched it out in the light. as you know, pashmina is a fine type of wool from kashmir. the term itself translates into “soft gold” in the kashmiri language. and if you saw it, you’d agree it looked so. detailed stitching had gone into the fabric and, as the two students focused more closely on it, they could see the -- creed of the willpower warrior sewn into the shawl. below this title was a series of statements that explained what the “--” meant. it was all quite unique. here’s what the handcrafted stitching said: the scientific truths behind excellent habits truth #: world-class willpower isn’t an inborn strength, but a skill developed through relentless practice. getting up at dawn is perfect self-control training. truth #: personal discipline is a muscle. the more you stretch it, the stronger it grows. therefore, the samurais of self-regulation actively create conditions of hardship to build their natural power. truth #: like other muscles, willpower weakens when tired. recovery is, therefore, absolutely necessary for the expression of mastery. and to manage decision fatigue. truth #: installing any great habit successfully follows a distinct four-part pattern for automation of the routine. follow it explicitly for lasting results. truth #: increasing self-control in one area of your life elevates self-control in all areas of your life. this is why joining the am club is the game-changing habit that will lift everything else that you do. the values of heroic habit-makers value #: victory demands consistency and persistency. value #: following through on what is started determines the size of the personal respect that will be generated. value #: the way you practice in private is precisely the way you’ll perform once you’re in public. the general theory of self-discipline spartans to regularly do that which is hard but important when it feels most uncomfortable is how warriors are born. the billionaire closed his eyes and repeated this phrase: “i don’t wish for an easy life because there is no growth of my powers there. give me a challenging life—one that brings out the finest in me. for this makes an iron will. and an unconquerable character. “this shawl is my gift to you two,” the industrialist went on. “please do study the five scientific truths and the three values along with the one general theory that make up the -- creed of the willpower warrior . it will serve you brilliantly as you encode habits that endure.” within a few moments, an auto rickshaw sped up from an empty parking area off in the distance. out came a smiling young man dressed smartly in a dark gray jacket, perfectly pressed trousers and polished brown shoes. “namaste, arjun,” said the billionaire as he clasped his hands together. “hey, boss,” was the warm reply of this assistant. though his words were casual, the way he articulated them demonstrated immense respect for his employer. “you two know the story behind the taj mahal?” the billionaire asked as the aide stood off to the side, looking ready to offer any help mr. riley required. “please tell us,” the entrepreneur requested. she carried a single legal notepad with a simple black rollerball pen. all the billionaire’s early talk of how the misuse of technology leads to the destruction of creativity and an extreme reduction in productivity was having a major impact on her. today, she wore a bangle engraved with the words “dreams don’t come true while you’re sleeping.” “sure—it’s a rad story,” gushed the billionaire, retreating to more of his california surfer slang. “like you two sweethearts, the mughal emperor shah jahan who masterminded this marvel was very much in love. as a symbol of his devotion to and adoration of his wife, mumtaz, after her death in , he committed himself to the construction of a monument the likes of which the world had never seen. one so extravagantly sensational, staggeringly inspirational and structurally exceptional that all onlookers would understand the depth of this man’s affection as they experienced all its splendor.” “it does something to my heart when i look at it,” murmured the artist, staring at the marble facade that glimmered in front of him. he squinted as the early morning rays struck his eyes. he was looking more fit, calm, confident and poised than the entrepreneur had ever observed. “me too,” agreed the billionaire with a note of melancholy in his voice. “seeing the taj mahal isn’t just an excursion of the intellect. it’s also a resurrection of the spirit. it wakes even the numbest person up to what we, as human creatures, are capable of producing. but to continue, once the maharaja set his bold intention, his workers started the process of translating that lofty vision into a definite reality. because, as you both now know, ambition without implementation is a ridiculous delusion . you two are now much more fluent in the insight that anything legendary requires generous amounts of industry, artistry and persistency. mastery isn’t a sudden event. it really is a ceaseless process that may take years of painstaking craftsmanship, practice, sacrifice and suffering before the finished project intensifies to a level that moves the world. “this is yet another gca—a gargantuan competitive advantage,” continued mr. riley. “to remain loyal to your noble ideal not only during the weeks after you thought up the dream but over the long months and perhaps extended years in the parched desert of creative implementation while you endure rejection, exhaustion, the stones of jealous peers, the skepticism of your loved ones, being diverted by other attractive opportunities and finding your way through the isolated winters of self-doubt. this is what separates the also-rans from the icons. anyone can be great for a minute. the sport of icons is sustaining genius-grade performance over a"
sharma,"lifetime. and that takes unusual grit and patience uncommon in these superficial times. the kind that the majority of society today has sadly failed to develop. know what i mean?” the billionaire was animated, energetic and completely jacked up. he threw an arm into the air and flashed the universal victory sign with two fingers. it seemed he did so just to protect his inspiration. and to insulate the fire that had been activated within his heart. “many decades ago, albert e.n. gray delivered an address for salespeople in the insurance industry. he called it the common denominator of success, and it distilled what the author had identified over thirty years of study as the greatest key to fortune in one’s business, family, health, financial and spiritual lives.” “what was it?” inquired the entrepreneur with acute interest as she sipped her now tepid coffee. “well,” offered the billionaire, “from my recollection of the pamphlet that was made from the talk and then widely circulated to top sales professionals, he said, ‘i had been brought up on the popular belief that the secret of success is hard work but i had seen so many people work hard without succeeding that i became convinced hard work was not the real secret.’” “so, what was it?” implored the artist impatiently. “dude, i’m getting to it,” the magnate replied playfully. “so, albert gray said, ‘this common denominator of success is so big, so powerful …” “and it is?” interjected the entrepreneur, equally unable to wait for the answer. “gray explained that ‘the common denominator of success—the secret of success of every man and woman who has ever been successful—lies in the fact that they formed the habit of doing things that failures don’t like to do .’” “simple. and profound,” observed the artist as he ran one hand down one dreadlock. he, too, sipped some now cold coffee. “top producers make it a habit to do the high-value activities that average ones don’t feel like doing—even when they, too, don’t feel like doing them,” the billionaire continued. “and by practicing the desired behavior over and over, their self-mastery and personal discipline grows. and the new routine becomes automated.” the artist nodded, then stroked his goatee. he was thinking about his art. “i truly have been limiting myself because of my insecurities,” he thought, once again. “i’m so worried about what others will say about my work that i’m not creating enough. and mr. riley’s right. i’m not being patient and building the self-control that doing difficult but valuable things brings. i sort of just do what i want, anytime i want. some days i have some drive, and other times i sleep all day. sometimes i’m lazy. some days i work hard. i’m like a cork bobbing in the water, with no steady direction. no real structure. no real discipline. i play video games a lot, sometimes for many hours. and i have this habit of rushing to create paintings that sell fast when i need some money instead of slowing down and concentrating all my skill on the one opus that will define the extent of my expertise. and turn my whole field on its head by its genius.” “so,” the billionaire expounded, returning to his story about the making of the taj mahal. “for twenty-two years—not twenty-two days and not twenty-two months—twenty-two years , over twenty thousand workers toiled in the scorching indian sun. block of marble by block of marble carried from immense distances by over one thousand elephants, the army of craftsmen steadily erected the structure you’re seeing. they faced architectural roadblocks, environmental extremes and unexpected tragedies along the journey. yet, they were focused, fearless and relentless, dazzlingly committed to doing whatever it took to get the emperor’s gorgeous dream done.” “really incredible, you know,” said the artist, as he surveyed the landmark. a butterfly sailed by. a few raindrops sprinkled on his face. and, believe it or not, more doves soared high above the billionaire’s head. “what’s with all the doves, rainbows and butterflies that seem to surround you a lot of the time?” pressed the entrepreneur as she adjusted the t-shirt she was wearing. it had a quote from oscar wilde on it that seemed to fit the newfound awareness of the businesswoman. it read, “be yourself. everyone else is already taken.” “we all have the magic. most of us don’t know how to use it,” was the baron’s brief and mysterious reply. “so, getting back to the taj mahal, after two decades, this mausoleum was complete,” he remarked in a hushed tone. “and humankind was given one of the greatest products of poetic audacity it has ever received.” “i’m beyond inspired,” confided the entrepreneur. “thank you so much for bringing us here to agra. i’m ever so grateful.” “the emperor must have really cared for his wife,” mused the artist, delivering a penetrating reveal of the wonderfully obvious. he then looked intently at the entrepreneur. her radiance went far beyond the basic beauty of starlets, models and women of high glamour. hers was a quieter, more profound loveliness, the kind that makes sunrises special and moonbeams enchanting. he thought to himself that this woman’s magnetism comes from a place deeper than merely an attractive face. it was a charm born of struggle, an electricity emanating from hurt, an energy emitting through a formidable intellect and a prettiness formed by her robust resolve to step into a person of true power, wisdom and love. “the taj mahal is such a direct metaphor for you cats to consider on the subject of staying with the commitment to a new habit through whatever hardships show up. and remaining sincere to your ideals not only in the seasons of comfort but especially when it all gets terrifically difficult. and that’s why this morning’s coaching is so exceedingly important. what you’re about to learn will help you implement so much of the philosophies i’ve shared with you up until now. the spellbinder"
sharma,"has carefully developed the model i’m about to reveal, over many, many years working with business-builders, masterful achievers and change-makers like myself. today’s session isn’t so much about why you should embrace the morning ritual of rising before the sun. it’s much more about how you can get this routine done. as a lifetime regime,” explained the industrialist as he rubbed an earlobe like an imaginative child rubbing a magic lamp. “awesome,” said the artist. “i need this. the practical ways to make sure i don’t stop getting up at am after this adventure ends.” “cool,” indicated the billionaire. “then let’s go!” two burly security guards then led the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist through a private entrance into the complex, usually reserved for heads of state, members of royalty and other global leaders. once inside the monument, which was dark and still, the billionaire began his discourse. “this is a fascinating, riveting, confusing and exciting period in the lifeline of the world. for those showing up as victims each morning, and every day, the future will be very hard, dangerous and frightening because they won’t know what hit them. and they’ll be absolutely unprotected to deal with the environmental, economic and societal upheaval that is coming. yet for the dedicated minority who have habituated a battleproofed morning routine to defend their gifts, cultivated heroic personal restraint and developed a bulletproofed character through the rigorous training of their muscles of self-discipline, the times ahead will be phenomenally rich, harmonious and ultra-productive. those who have armored themselves against the turbulence on its way by installing a world-class and carefully granulated morning ritual will actually be in a position to leverage all the messiness into humongous opportunity. and transform all the confusion into a supreme sense of clarity, genius and calmness that allows them to win.” the billionaire rubbed his turban and then, for some reason unknown to his two students, began to whisper. “the first insight i’ll offer you here is that your brain is constructed for expansion. yes, i’ll agree those who are stuck in their pro and personal lives and those who are working under a mentality of can’t versus running a psychology of possibility will argue that there’s no way they can make the improvements they need to make by wiring in great habits like being members of the am club. they’ll fight to the death on the ‘reality’ of why it’s impossible for them to accelerate their creativity, productivity, prosperity, performance and impact. they’ll totally try to get you to believe their rationalizations for being unable to materialize an amazing career and manifest an exquisite private life. they have given away their power to make change for so long, they’ve come to believe their powerlessness represents the truth. neglect your power long enough and you’ll eventually believe you don’t have any. but, the reality of their conditions is a very different story. the fact is that such people—good, well-intentioned, talent-filled people—have allowed the forces of their sovereign selves to become corrupted so often they’ve succumbed to a state of acute passivity. yes, most people are passive instead of active builders of the ambitions within them. and then unconsciously they’ve manufactured a series of excuses about why they can’t show up as leaders in their work and capable creators of their lives because they’re so scared to leave the safety of their stuckedness and make the very improvements that would bring them to glory.” the billionaire stopped to draw in a giant gulp of air. a ray of golden sunlight peeked into the taj mahal. then he carried on. “science now confirms that our brains can continue to grow throughout our lives. this beautiful phenomenon is called neuroplasticity. and it speaks to the fact that the human brain, like personal willpower, is a lot more like a muscle than previously understood. it’s plastic in a way. push it and it’ll expand. flex it and it’ll extend—and become more potent for your use in the tallest expression of your most radiant gifts. so, you want to make sure you exercise your brain aggressively to make new habits like getting up early your new normal. neurons that fire together, wire together , you know? as you repeat the routine you wish to add to your lifestyle, it becomes easier—and more familiar. that’s a really important point to contemplate. and then act on.” “i’ve never been aware that we actually have the ability to grow our brains,” noted the entrepreneur excitedly. “and i guess what you’re saying is the more we practice a fresh habit, the more our brains will work with us and evolve to make it part of who we are. right?” “yup,” responded the billionaire. he loved seeing how the two human beings he was mentoring were improving through his sharing. real leaders always feel great joy when they shine a light on the talents of others. “powerful idea,” he went on with his finger now on the wall of the wonder of the world. “you don’t have the brain you want, you have the brain you’ve earned. or to put it another way, you don’t have the brain you desire, you have the brain you deserve—based on how you’ve been operating it. spend your days diverted by your devices, tethered to television and majoring in mindless pursuits and your brain will be weak and flabby through your mistreatment of it. just like other muscles, it will atrophy. and this will result in weaker cognition, slower learning and lower processing power. your competition will destroy you and your targets will elude you. on the other hand, when you use your brain intelligently by expanding its limits and running it like a titan, it will expand and increase its connectivity causing important gains in your productivity, performance and influence. the brains of london taxi drivers were studied and the area responsible for spatial reasoning, the hippocampus, was found to be significantly larger in them compared to the brains"
sharma,"of ordinary people. guess why?” “because of the complexity of the street system in london,” the artist responded confidently. “you got it,” applauded the billionaire. “so, just as you develop your biceps in the gym by lifting dumbbells or doing push-ups, the cabbies in london flexed their hippocampi as they drove each day. and, like i said, given that the brain is a lot more like a muscle than neuroanatomists previously understood, that part of it grew stronger. see how powerful we human beings are? this is a superb example of the neuroplasticity we all have at our disposal. the brain can be strengthened, sculpted and optimized—if we choose to make it so. when you guys get home, study this phenomenon as well as the awesome process of neurogenesis, which describes the brain’s natural ability to actually breed new neu-rons. the emerging neuroscience explaining the availability of mastery to every single person alive today, no matter where they live or how old they are or what they do or how hard their pasts have been, is so incredibly exciting,” the tycoon gushed. “anyhoo,” he added, “for now, please just know that the brain has a malleability and a muscularity to it. and what makes the great ones the great ones is they truly understand that daily discomfort is the price of enduring success. and that pushing ourselves hard builds the kind of brain that generates military-grade discipline. it’s such a myth that the superproducers had easy lives!” the billionaire reached into a pocket, pulled out a sealed envelope and handed it to the entrepreneur. “please open this. and read it for us—with as much conviction and passion as you have,” the baron instructed politely. inside, on a neatly folded piece of fine stationery, the businesswoman found the following words of the illustrious philosopher friedrich nietzsche: do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! one can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. they acquired greatness, became “geniuses” (as we put it), through qualities the lack of which no one who knew what they were would boast of: they all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole. “flip the page over. please,” requested the billionaire as his eyes twinkled in the light entering the taj mahal. the entrepreneur read a second quote that had been carefully written with what she guessed was an indigo-inked fountain pen. the phrase was from the english poet william ernest henley. imagine these words infusing the deepest and most unstained part of your soul: it matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, i am the master of my fate, i am the captain of my soul. “the masters and the geniuses and the heroes of civilization all lived hard lives,” expanded the billionaire. “they trained tough. they ‘played through pain,’ to borrow a term a lot of superstar athletes use these days. they pushed their potential fiercely. they were ambitious, ceaseless and ferocious when it came to the complete capitalization of their grandest potential. the latin root of the word ‘passion’ means to ‘suffer.’ these women and men suffered for their visions, ideals and aspirations. they suffered for the increase of their skill and sacrificed for the realization of their prowess. they endured enormous anguish as they advanced their crafts and abandoned their temptations. and i must tell you, these illustrious performers also suffered for the state of the world. playing small with your promise demotes our world, you know. because the planet becomes a poorer place without your greatness in it.” suddenly, the billionaire fell to his knees. he lay flat on the floor and closed his eyes, folding his arms over his heart. the tycoon then began to snore. loudly. “what the heck are you doing now, brother?” asked the artist, appearing both confused and amused. “voluntary discomfort,” was the speedy reply. more snoring. “i want my teddy bear!” he cried. “and my jammies.” stone riley then began to suck his thumb. “he’s unreal,” laughed the entrepreneur, clearly entertained by yet another stunt of this maverick industrialist. one could see the billionaire was now smiling, apparently impressed with his comedic skills as well as his unusual ability to make a teaching point. remaining on the ground, he said: “the single best way to build your willpower is to voluntarily put yourself into conditions of discomfort. the spellbinder calls these ‘strengthening scenarios.’ when i was much younger and my ability to command myself to do what i needed to do when i didn’t feel like doing it was much weaker, i’d give in to my lesser urges so easily. my self-discipline muscles were very flabby because i wasn’t exercising them. the spellbinder knew i needed to become a lot stronger so i could install the am routine—in a way that stayed with me my whole career. so, he had me actively put myself into situations of hardship. and it worked like magic.” “what kind of situations?” asked the artist. “once a week, i slept on the floor.” “you’re serious?” quizzed the entrepreneur. “really?” “absolutely,” the billionaire confirmed. “and i began taking cold showers every morning. twice a week i’d fast, like so many of the most accomplished women and men of the world have done to capitalize on and manifest their primal power. it’s remarkable how much time i’d save during the fasting windows when i wouldn’t eat. and striking how clear my thinking would be and how much energy i’d have. oh, and when i’d be at my loft in zurich, to promote my toughness and grit, i’d do some hard winter training by running in the snow with only a t-shirt and a pair of shorts on.” the billionaire stood up. “it’s exactly"
sharma,"what i’ve been suggesting since we got to the taj mahal: you have the capacity for world-class self-control. science confirms it. the real key is to push your brain to develop new neural pathways and to force your willpower muscles to flex and stretch, intentionally working these natural resources up to their highest level. this is how anyone can become so strong, courageous and undefeatable that, no matter what obstacles they face and difficulties they experience, they continue on their quest to meet their glorious goals. why do you think navy seals and members of the sas—true willpower warriors—actively expose themselves to such potentially spirit-crushing scenarios? all those long runs in the rain, with heavy backpacks on. crawling through thick mud in the middle of the night. eating brutal food and living in a spartan setting. confronting their fears by performing tests like jumping into the ocean from cliffs, backwards, with blindfolds on, or enduring exercises involving psychological degradation so they train themselves to transcend what most limits them. look, cats, bravery—and the capacity to do the difficult things that are necessary for the fullest expression of your greatness—isn’t a divine blessing. nope. not at all. it’s a voluntary practice. toughness—and a will of iron—takes devotion. so, i very much suggest you begin to suffocate your demons, slay your dragons and hug your monsters by doing more demanding things. this is one of the surest routes to masterful achievement and a private life you’ll be ever so proud of at the end. you know, this makes me think of the irish playwright george bernard shaw. boy did that dude have a cool beard,” the billionaire said awkwardly. “ever seen it?” he kept on. “i have not,” the artist responded. “you should, it’s gnarly,” the mogul noted. he then snapped his fingers eight times. after this, an unknown voice bellowed from somewhere within the mausoleum, “the reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” the voice grew silent. “george bernard shaw wrote that in his play man and superman , a four-act drama that he produced in . all i’m trying to say is this: when it comes to fulfilling your gifts, talents, admirable ambitions and instinct to change the world in whatever way most resonates with you, never, ever be reasonable with yourself.” the billionaire paused. and then did something his two students had not seen anyone do before. he kissed the area of flesh between the index finger and thumb of his left hand. “you gotta love yourself before you can lift the world, by the way,” he muttered with a grin before proceeding with his mentoring. “inspiring,” the artist admitted. “what george bernard shaw said.” “research proves that training yourself so your willpower becomes maximized is one of the crowning achievements of an epic life,” the billionaire continued. “the welsh explorer henry morton stanley observed that self-control is more indispensable than gunpowder.” “definitely inspiring,” the entrepreneur echoed. “look,” said the billionaire. “it’s such a myth that celebrated athletes and legendary artists and revered statesmen and stateswomen had more natural willpower than the rest of us. that’s just a big lie. what’s real,” he declared, “is that these exceptionalists began as ordinary people. and through relentless practice and constant drilling to wire in excellent daily habits, their power to manage themselves against their cravings and temptations grew stronger until the culture perceived them as superhumans.” “small, daily, seemingly insignificant improvements, when done consistently over time, yield staggering results,” commented the artist, happily reciting the valuable brain tattoo that he’d embraced on this wondrous journey. he reached over and grasped the hand of the entrepreneur. “that’s right,” acknowledged the billionaire. “what looks to the human eye like invisible and infinitesimal optimizations around your willpower—when performed daily—are what make you into a michelangelo or a da vinci or a disney or a chopin or a coco chanel or a roger bannister or a pelé or a marcus aurelius or a copernicus over extended periods of training. the true geniuses all started out as ordinary people. but they practiced building up their strength so much and so often that showing up at world-class became automated. here’s another brain tattoo the spellbinder taught me: legendary performers practice being spectacular for so long that they no longer remember how to behave in non-spectacular ways. ” “so, practically speaking, where do we start?” the entrepreneur asked. “because i know both of us want a lot more self-discipline, and to have excellent habits that last a lifetime. especially getting up at am .” “follow me,” instructed the industrialist. mr. riley led them down a corridor of the monument, past a series of dim rooms and into a small chamber. in one corner sat a blackboard. the billionaire picked up a piece of chalk and proceeded to draw this diagram: lola landekic “this simple model is based on the latest studies on how habits are formed,” he began. “your starting point is to create some kind of a trigger. to embed the early-rising ritual into your mornings, this could be as simple as having an old-school alarm clock next to your bed that goes off at am . when we get to rome, i’ll explain why you shouldn’t have any technology in your bedroom.” “rome?” the entrepreneur and the artist exclaimed at the same time. the billionaire ignored them. “once you’ve got the trigger of your alarm clock in place, the next step—as you can see from my diagram—is to run the routine you want to encode.” “so, we just get out of bed, right?” queried the entrepreneur. “yup,” said the billionaire. “it sounds obvious, but jump straight out of bed before your reasoning mind—the prefrontal cortex—can give you a bunch of excuses about why you should go back to sleep. it’s in this very moment that, by getting out of bed, you build the early-rising neural circuit"
sharma,"in your brain through the power of neuroplasticity. and remember: brain pathways that fire together wire together into a potent neural highway, over time. it’s in the very instant when you’re faced with staying on the mattress or standing up and starting your morning in a great way that you have the chance to make your willpower stronger. it’s uncomfortable at the start, i know.” “all change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end,” interrupted the artist, reinforcing another of the spellbinder’s brain tattoos. “yes,” agreed the billionaire. “the next step of the four-part pattern to program in a new ritual is to make sure you have a preset reward in place. the reward is what kickstarts and then grows your drive to get the new habit done. always use the power of rewards for the advancement of your triumphs. so, let’s assume you do what you know to be right instead of following what’s easy and sprint out of bed fast—as soon as the alarm goes off. i’ll explain exactly what to do during your victory hour from to am when i walk you through the // formula .” “man—are you ever going to teach it to us?” the artist interrupted again. he wasn’t being rude. if you were in that chamber with those three, you’d sense that he only spoke that way because he was so interested in the am method. that’s all. “ the // formula is the subject of tomorrow morning’s coaching session,” the billionaire offered with the utmost grace. “for now, let’s stay centered on the third step. you need to set up a reward. that’s what the eminent researchers on willpower tell us is essential to create behaviors that stick. your reward for rising with the sun could be a nice piece of dark chocolate for dessert at lunch. it could be taking a nap later in the day, another favored rite of the planet’s greatest creatives. it could be treating yourself to the book you’ve been wanting to buy for your library. you can figure out what feels right for you.” “got it,” said the entrepreneur. she was now sure that all this information would significantly elevate her business game and dramatically uplift her mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset—leading her into a truly excellent life. “good. that brings us to the final point in the pattern,” said the billionaire as he touched the piece of chalk to the word “repetition” on the blackboard, in that room of the taj mahal. “the way to annihilate the weakest impulses of your lower self and to free yourself of the cravings and temptations that are blocking your best is through ceaseless repetition of the new behavior you’re working hard to install. the word that comes to mind here is steadfast . be steadfast in your commitment to remaining a lifelong member of the am club. be absolutely dedicated and excuseless in following through on this life-altering self-promise. each time you follow through, you’ll deepen the relationship with your sovereign self. each time you rise at dawn, you’ll purify your character, fortify your willpower and magnify the fires of your soul. i guess what i’m trying to help you two wonderful people appreciate is that the real measure of your majesty is shown not in your outer moments before an audience, but in the soft and early light of lonely practice. you become undefeatable in the world by what you do when no one’s watching.” “i’ve read a fair amount about championship sports teams,” said the entrepreneur. “really helped me build superb squads at my company. and if there’s one thing i’ve learned, it’s that what took the winning team to victory was less how they played in the last seconds of a close final game and more how disciplined they were at practice.” “exactly,” agreed the billionaire. “the brilliant moves in the last seconds of the championship match were automatic —the result of tireless hours of repetition of those splendid moves during training.” “cool point,” the artist thought to himself. “i want to get to one remaining learning model this morning before i let you cats go, one that will make it incredibly clear how installing a habit follows a sixty-six-day process. yet, before i do, i did want to share a few more fast practical points on self-discipline.” “great,” the artist replied. “today’s lesson has been big for me. i know it’ll help me beat procrastination, and i’m sure it’ll improve the quality of my art. and i’ve already been making progress on calibrating my physical fitness.” “he has,” agreed the entrepreneur with a wink. “well, just remember that willpower weakens once it gets tired. scientists call the condition ‘ego depletion.’ see, you wake up each morning with a full battery of self-control. that’s why i want you to do the activities that are most important to the rise of your inner empires at the time when your capacity is strongest—at am . here’s the thing: as you go through your day, going to meetings, checking messages and performing tasks, your ability to self-regulate decreases—and so does your capability to handle temptations and manage weak impulses. the fact that human discipline muscles get tired from all the decision fatigue explains why so many massively successful people end up doing something foolish that destroys their careers. they gave in to the urge that causes their downfall because all day long they were making important decisions. by the time it was evening, they had no willpower left in their battery to manage the craving.” “super-fascinating,” remarked the entrepreneur. “this explains a lot.” “so, the key is rest and recovery of the self-control muscle,” explained the billionaire. “never allow it to get too tired. your willpower really is weakest when you are most tired. key awareness to build on here. we make our worst decisions and our lowest choices when we’re exhausted. so, don’t allow yourself to get exhausted. period. i have"
sharma,"a powerful mentoring session on how the best in the world protect priceless assets like their willpower through the lost art of personal regeneration planned for you later.” mr. riley began to cough. a concerning, throaty cough. not an insignificant one. “oh,” he added, regaining his composure. “please also know the research also supports the idea that external order increases your discipline. that’s why steve jobs made sure the workplace at next was minimalist and painted all-white when he was there. mess lowers your self-control as well as steals your cognitive bandwidth.” “maybe that’s why so many so-called geniuses wear the same uniform every day,” the artist commented. “they want to keep order and structure in their lives. and they understand that each morning we wake up with a limited amount of willpower as well as mental focus. so, rather than wasting these valuable gifts by spreading them over many trivial choices like what to wear and what to eat, they automate as many basic things as possible, so they can concentrate their highest powers on just a few important activities. now i’m getting how geniuses become geniuses even more. if all i did every day was my art and only a handful of other things, i wouldn’t suffer from ‘decision fatigue,’ as you call it. and that would mean i wouldn’t waste so much time in the evening—and make so many bad choices as the day ends, like watching stupid tv shows, eating so much junk food and sipping too much tequila.” “okay,” declared the billionaire. “you folks clearly now know ‘all change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.’ that insight should be well on its way to settling in as a default belief of your mindset. now, let’s deconstruct that powerful brain tattoo of the spellbinder into a potent model which explains the three phases every habit installation goes through so you have even more firepower to lock in the regime of rising at dawn. you’ll absolutely love what you’re about to learn. promise me you’ll turn up the volume of your listening as we go through this? then we’ll call it a morning.” “we promise,” the entrepreneur and the artist expressed together. “pinky promise?” asked the billionaire, putting out a little finger. “yes,” responded the entrepreneur as she locked pinkies with her mentor. “yes,” agreed the artist, as he did the same. “terrific,” enthused the magnate. one of the security guards who had led the three companions into the structure walked in and pulled a chart out of a backpack. he shone his flashlight onto it so all could see what had been printed on it. the teaching framework that came into view looked like this: “on the coding of any new habit, you’ll move through an initial period of destruction,” said mr. riley as he pointed to the first phase on the diagram. “keep at it and you’ll definitely move ahead into the second stage of the process, where new neural pathways are formed and the real installation begins. this is the messy middle. finally, as you stick with your practice of making any fresh routine your normal way of being, you’ll arrive at the final—and wonderful—stage: integration. the whole exercise takes approximately sixty-six days, according to the research data of university college london. the spellbinder, in his teachings, calls this powerful fact the day minimum . sixty-six days of training to make a new habit yours. so, don’t quit after a few days, or a few weeks, or even after two months. as it relates to becoming a member of the am club, stick with your self-promise for at least sixty-six days. no matter what. do this one thing and the remainder of your life will be exponentially better. this i promise you from my heart,” said the billionaire. “see, all change is hard at first. that’s why the spellbinder named stage one ‘destruction.’ if it wasn’t difficult at the start, it wouldn’t be real change. it’s supposed to be hard because you’re rewriting the past patterns of your mind and destroying old ways of operating. and rewiring past programs of your heart and emotions. do you know why the space shuttle uses more fuel in the sixty seconds after liftoff than it uses over the entire orbit around the earth?” “it needs to overcome the powerful forces of gravity after it takes off,” the artist answered confidently. “exactly,” the billionaire affirmed. “it requires a large amount of fuel to overcome those initial forces and reach escape velocity. but once it does, momentum kicks in and the craft just goes. the first phase of creating any new habit—the destruction stage—is precisely like this. you need to overcome your deeply ingrained habits, dominant rituals and traditional states of performance. you need to rise above your own forces of gravity—until your escape velocity kicks in. it’s so challenging at the beginning. i’m not going to lie to you—you both have done very well getting up at am over the mornings you’ve been with me. but you will hit a wall over these first twenty-two days while you’re in phase one. nothing wrong—just part of the habit installation process anyone seeking peak productivity and a richer life must go through. for most people ready to get up before daybreak, each day of this first phase is a hardship. they feel like giving up. they complain that rising early just isn’t for them. that they’re not built for this routine and that it’s just not worth the pain. my advice is simple: continue at all costs. persistency sits at the threshold of mastery. the things that feel hardest are also the ones that are most valuable. keep remembering that doing difficult things that are very important was how the highest achievers and greatest heroes of our civilization embraced their power. please also remember this rule: when faced with a choice, always choose the one that pushes you the most, increases your growth"
sharma,"and promotes the unfoldment of your gifts, talents and personal prowess . so, when you feel like quitting, persevere. you’ll get to the next stage soon. and understand the negative thoughts, cranky emotions and strong desires to surrender are a normal part of the process of hardwiring any new regime. the first twenty-two days are supposed to feel like a mild form of torture.” “because stage one is all about the destruction of old ways of being so that new ones can be set up, right?” the entrepreneur asked. “precisely,” the billionaire confirmed. “and just because you couldn’t do something before doesn’t mean you can’t do it now,” he added while nodding in an encouraging way. “i need to repeat what i said so you absolutely lock it in: if it wasn’t hard initially, it wouldn’t be real—and valuable—change. society has programmed us to think that because it’s difficult at first, something bad is happening. that we should stop what we’re doing. and return to the safe house of our former normal. zero growth and evolution toward legendary in that mode of operating. zero.” “so true,” agreed the entrepreneur. “everyone i know repeats the familiar every day. okay. maybe not everyone, but definitely most people. same thoughts, same behaviors and the same moves.” “the truth is not that they can’t change,” said mr. riley. “it’s just that they didn’t make the commitment to improve and then stay with the process long enough for their neurobiology as well as their psychology, physiology, emotionality and spirituality to work its natural wonders. everything you now find easy you once found hard, you know.” the billionaire then asked for the security guard’s flashlight and focused it onto the part of the learning model related to the second stage of routinization. “thanks, krishna,” he added. “see here—all change is messy in the middle. stage two is called ‘installation’ because it’s like you’re going through an interior renovation, of sorts. former foundations need to be torn down so that much better ones can be put up. this stage will make you feel confused, stressed out and frustrated. you’ll feel like quitting even more—and dismissing your decision to join the am club as a terrible one. you’ll long to go back to staying in your warm bed and counting more sheep. just know and trust that all is good. very good, actually. and though you can’t see it, you’re advancing even further in the habituation of making the early-rising routine yours for the rest of your life. things are about to get easier. they really are. you’re just going through the second stage of the procedure. and it only feels messy. and, it only looks chaotic. the reality is you’re growing beautifully. and closing in on a whole new grade of performing. ‘in all disorder there is a secret order,’ said famed psychologist carl jung. “so, when you’re wiring in this priceless new morning routine, the entire structure of your brain really is in upheaval as you manufacture new neural pathways. your whole system really is being restructured. you’re honestly in seriously unfamiliar territory. sprouting green shoots. going blue ocean. conquering new territories of self-potential and accessing higher universes of human optimization. cortisol, the fear hormone, is elevated at this time so you’ll feel scared a lot of the time. all that’s happening within your brain is consuming huge reserves of energy. so, you’ll be exhausted often at stage two of habit installation. the ancient sages, seers and philosophers called such a profound personal transformation ‘the dark night of the soul.’ what was once a caterpillar is messily—yet almost magically—becoming a butterfly. the mystics wrote of deep and real change as a journey involving a series of little deaths. the old you must die so a better you can be reborn . the spellbinder says that ‘for you to upgrade to greatness you must undergo an annihilation of your weakness.’ dramatic words, i’ll admit. but the guru speaks truthfully. in stage two, sometimes you might even feel like everything’s falling apart. but actually, all is coming together—even better. your human perception is often not reality, as you’ve learned. it’s just you seeing the world through a lens. the fact is that the illusion of safety is always so much more deadly than your rise toward personal mastery. stay in stage two of the process for around twenty-two days. and just know that unfathomable rewards are coming.” “i love all that you just said,” interjected the artist. “i’ll install the early-rising ritual for the rest of my life—even if it kills me trying,” he promised to himself. the billionaire grew quiet. “i’ve been through this shedding and transforming process many, many times. each time i go for a new habit, or greater skill, or even a more evolved core belief, i go into this death-and-rebirth cycle. and i need to tell you that it does feel like the end. you’ll be so scared at times, tired a lot for a while and confused by what the dark voice of your ego will say. you’ll even feel like you’re going crazy sometimes. that’s why so few people do this work. and why so few reach the rare-air of epic performance and make a worldwide impact on the culture. it’s a sport only for outright warriors. it requires enormous courage, immense conviction and uncommon strength of character. you have all this in you. just resolve to apply it. as i said, with practice and patience, it’ll all get easier. and eventually automatic. “okay, cats,” spoke the billionaire as he clapped his hands together like an encouraging football coach. “i know you’re getting this beautifully. so, let’s keep jamming. stick with the process of new habit installation through the breakdown of old patterns, which happens in stage one. then continue through the formation of new circuitry in your brain, which happens through neuroplasticity and the manufacturing of better pathways in your emotional core in stage two. do that, and you’ll most"
sharma,"certainly reach stage three, the final part of your ascension: ‘integration.’ remember: all change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.” the billionaire paused, smiled gently and then touched his toes. he kissed the flesh between his fingers again. then he went on. “this final stage is when it all comes together,” he explained, “and you get to experience the benefits of your fantastic commitment to being a lifetime member of the am club. you’re nearing the end of the roughly sixty-six-day period required for a human brain—and being—to encode a routine. so now it’s success time. you’ve advanced through the initial disruption, you’ve made it through the dangerousness and chaos of the middle phase and you’ve come out the other side stronger, more skilled and with greater intimacy of your most supreme—and invincible—nature. you’re now the next version of your greatest self, able to bring on a bigger game, influence more people by the glorious power of your example and be more useful to the world because you’ve owned more of your primal heroism. all your hard work, sacrifice and suffering, careful consistency and brilliant bravery come together in this stage as the new habit you’ve been working on integrates at a psychological, emotional, physical and spiritual level. and becomes your new normal.” “normal?” wondered the artist. “life gets easy?” the billionaire suddenly fell to the marble floor of the taj mahal and started doing more push-ups. he looked sort of like a boxer training for the main event. “what the heck are you doing now?” questioned the entrepreneur, amused. “he’s crazier than i ever imagined,” she thought. “i do love him.” “the primary purpose of life is growth: to be continuously pushing yourself to materialize more of your potential. my daily push-ups not only keep me in a state of continual optimization toward world-class. it’s also a tremendous way to keep myself feeling young, happy and alive. boredom kills the human spirit.” the industrialist stood up. “for the a-player, the top of one mountain is the bottom of the next. the installation of one great new habit brings on the outstanding opportunity to begin the next. i do one thousand push-ups a day, you know. superb exercise. one of the best. so simple. keeps me lean and chiseled. good for my core. and the exercise also recruits my glutes,” the billionaire said with an awkward expression. “but doing a thousand push-ups a day is also a ritual to remind me to keep going. keep expanding. keep elevating my mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset and escalating my rise to my best. honestly, i’m not afraid of failing. that’s just part of learning to fly. i’m just horrified of not growing.” “got you,” the entrepreneur said, scribbling frantically on her notepad. the billionaire then moved an index finger across the teaching model and rested it at the area that said, “the automaticity point.” “the exciting fact is that once you arrive at the automaticity point, you no longer need any willpower to get up at am . the new regime’s implementation into your human operating system is complete. awakening before dawn becomes second nature. and easy. here’s the real gift from your excellence and devotion over the sixty-six or so days: the willpower you were using to lay down the early-rising habit is now freed up for another world-class behavior , so you have the chance to grow even more productive, prosperous, joyful and successful. this is the hidden secret of all pro athletes, for example. it’s not that they have more self-discipline than the average person. it’s just that they capitalized on whatever impulse-control they had for sixty-six days until the game-winning routines got installed. after that, they redirected their willpower to something else that would improve their expertise. another practice that would help them lead their field and achieve victory. one habit installation after another habit installation is how the pros play. over time, their winning behaviors became automated. systematized. institutionalized. absolutely no effort was required to run them once they got hardwired. and these superstars practiced their habits of victory so often, they’ve arrived at a place where they forgot how to not do them.” “they got to a point where it was easier to run them than not to run them, right?” commented the entrepreneur. “absolutely correct,” responded the billionaire. the artist was excited. “so valuable to me personally and to my work as a painter. and, so i completely understand this process fully, each of the three stages—destruction, installation and integration—takes about twenty-two days, right?” “right. and at around the sixty-six-day mark it locks in as an automatic routine. that’s the automaticity point, because habits take around nine weeks to implement. don’t stop getting up at am after a week. don’t give up when it gets messy in the middle of the process. stay relentless through the entire exercise through all its trials and challenges just like shah jahan did as he and his workers constructed the taj mahal, building it into one of the wonders of the world. awesome takes patience. and genius takes time. stay true in your dedication to carving out an hour for yourself as the sun rises and while the majority sleeps to develop your four interior empires that will set you up to realize all the outer ones that your big hearts long to actualize. do not neglect the call on you to deploy your fullest talents, magnify your spectacular strengths, multiply your happiness and discover a paradise of peace within you that no outer event can ever reduce. this, my friends, is how you become undefeatable, unbreakable and a true master of your domain. as well as a wonder of the world, in your own unique way.” “love it,” beamed the entrepreneur. “bravo. totally helpful. explains why so few people have the habits necessary to achieve mastery. they just don’t stay with their initial commitment long enough for it to work. they"
sharma,"could. but they don’t.” “yup,” agreed the billionaire. “that’s why information and education, learning and growing are so vitally important. the majority just don’t know this life-changing model and the practical insights that i’ve revealed to you around it. and because they don’t know, they can’t apply. and knowledge unimplemented leaves potential undercapitalized. we’re all built for triumph, in whatever way we choose to define it. sadly, most of us have never been schooled in the philosophy and methodology that the spellbinder taught to me. the same teaching i’m now paying forward to you. you just need to make sure you tell as many people as possible about the spellbinder’s work. please. this way, we can help people leave the darkness of apathy, mediocrity and scarcity and find their inherent power to do astonishing things with the rest of their lives. god, we need to make this world a better, healthier, safer and more loving place.” “for sure,” the entrepreneur and the artist promised, together. the entrepreneur then stopped to take in the unforgettable nature of the scene that enveloped her. she was standing next to a man she’d unexpectedly fallen in love with over a bizarre, beautiful and marvelous adventure. she was standing inside one of the seven wonders of the world, located in india, a nation she’d always longed to visit for the breathtaking sights, exotic delights and the country’s extraordinarily special citizens. she paused to consider what had unfolded back in her usual world. the manipulations, the thievery, the disloyalties and the treachery. in that moment, she laughed. not some forced laugh that so many of us hear at business meetings where good people in quiet fear wear social masks in an effort to fit in, appear powerful and look cool. no, this was the palpable joy of a person who’d just discovered some of the true treasures of a life wisely lived. the entrepreneur, in that instant, realized how blessed she was. the takeover attempt would resolve itself since life always has a way of working things out for the best. sure, she’d learned not to repress the natural feelings of anger, disappointment and sometimes sadness that were arising within her from time to time when she’d think about the situation. that was just her being human and real and even brave, not weak. yet, she also now understood there were things more important than wealth, acclaim and fame. and that many financially rich people are actually desperately poor. “nothing’s as valuable as my happiness. nothing’s as priceless as my peace of mind,” the businesswoman thought. she’d found love. she was still in excellent health. she had so many things to be grateful for: two eyes to see the splendors of this wonderful world, two legs to explore it all, food on her table each night at a time when billions have empty bellies. and a roof over her head for ample shelter. she had wise books to read in her library, work that fed her creativity and, as the billionaire said so often, an opportunity to achieve outright mastery not only to benefit herself but also in service of society. and so, inside that majestic mausoleum that has electrified the inspiration of so many visitors from across the earth, and as the sun rose into the abundant indian sky, the entrepreneur found it in her heart to do something we all need to do more of. she forgave. she let go of her hostility toward her investors. she released her resentments for her detractors. and she let go of every single one of her weighty disappointments. life is too short to take things too seriously. and at the end of her life, what would matter most would not be whether those venture capitalists had ownership of her enterprise, but who she became as a human being. and the quality of the craft she produced. and how many people she helped. and how much she laughed. and how well she lived. the billionaire was right: every human being does the best they can do based on the level of consciousness they are currently at and on the grade of true power they can command. and if her investors had known better, they would have done better. these people generated pain and suffering for her because, at a deep and subconscious level, they are in pain. and because they are suffering. those who hurt others silently loathe themselves. yes, this sort of higher way of seeing things is not so common in our civilization. but maybe that’s why our world is filled with so many wars, so much danger and so much hatred. just maybe, she considered, these corporate bandits were her teachers. sent by life’s better nature to push her to the edge so she would reach such a place of disheartenment and despair that she’d have to change. and learn to soar. just maybe all she’d experienced was, as the billionaire taught, precious preparation for who she needed to become to fulfill the potential of her most luminous gifts and realize the promise of her most high destiny, in a way that benefited humanity. and, perhaps, it’s when we face losing everything that we come to know our grandest selves. this strange, quirky and most genuine mentor in front of her, mr. stone riley, was pouring his heart out, explaining how the simple yet not initially easy daily discipline of joining the am club could, and indeed would, transform the productivity, prosperity and well-being of any person who applied the method. he’d kept each of the lofty vows he had made at their bizarre first encounter, at the spellbinder’s mesmerizing conference. he’d shown himself to be a titan, not only of industry but also of integrity. and decency. “we need more of his kind,” she thought. “women and men who are pure leaders. people who influence not through the strength of a large

profoundly simple because they’re simply profound. the first point will remind you that rituals run deepest when performed in a group. that’s why being a member of the am club is so potent. you’re not installing this morning routine alone. we’re all in this together. and my sincere wish is that, when you cats get home, you bring as many people as you can—people who are ready to rise early so they can do world-class work and craft phenomenal lives—into the club. support groups have long been a proven way to make improvements that last. so, leverage this concept brilliantly, please.” the billionaire coughed. then he rubbed his chest, as if he were in pain. he pretended no one noticed. and advanced the dialogue. “the second point will remind you to actually teach the philosophy and methodology you’ve been learning from me. as you do so, your own understanding of the material will deepen even more superbly. in many ways, educating others on all i’ve shared will be a gift you provide to yourself.” “i’ve never looked at it that way,” observed the entrepreneur. “it’s truth,” informed the billionaire. “and the final line you see on this ceiling is the most important. remember that persistency is necessary for all forms of mastery. in that moment you feel you can’t go further lies an enormous opportunity to forge an entirely new level of willpower. when you feel you can’t continue, progress a little longer. your self-discipline muscle will be amplified considerably. and the degree of your self-respect will increase vastly. and few things are as essential to exponential productivity, leading your field and the creation of a life you adore as raising the appreciation you have for yourself.” stunningly and without any clue about what was coming, the billionaire flipped over and held a headstand. with eyes closed, he recited a phrase from gerald sykes, the writer and philosopher, that went like this: “any solid achievement must, of necessity, take years of humble apprenticeship and estrangement from most of society.” “you two amazing humans deserve to materialize your best selves and realize epic achievements,” the billionaire said as he returned to earth. “do not betray the powers that sleep within you by staying too late in a soft bed that keeps you sedated. the great men and women of the world became so not because they lounged glamorously under the covers, but because they set sublime ambitions that they then proceeded to do —even as the majority called them crazy. world-class takes time and commitment and sacrifice and patience—like the taj mahal shows us. and heroism never occurs in a single season. encode the am habit. stay with the process indefinitely and move ahead when you most feel like stopping. doing so will make you a legend. and seal your fate as someone who is worthy of worldwide influence.” stone riley then stood up. hugged his two students. and disappeared down a marble passageway. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club learns the // formula “early in the morning, when you are reluctant in your laziness to get up, let this thought be at hand: ‘i am rising to do the work of a human being.’” —marcus aurelius, roman emperor “rome is in my veins. its energy courses through my blood. and its unique type of magic resets my spirit,” thought the billionaire as his jet taxied along the tarmac of that city’s private airport. the song “magnolia” by italian music group negrita pulsed through the speakers of the aircraft as"
sharma,"the tycoon swayed his taut shoulders to the beat. “the fierce pride, fantastic passions and glorious hearts of the romans inspire me so much,” he affirmed to himself. “the way the light falls on trinità dei monti, the church that crowns the spanish steps, never fails to lift my soul—and often brings tears into my eyes. the exquisite food, including the mozzarella di bufala, cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara along with the fire-cooked abbacchio, feeds my desire to maximize the enjoyment of my life. and the painstakingly handcrafted architecture in this open-air museum of a city, where i love to walk in the rain, speaks to both the warrior as well as the poet within me,” the magnate reflected as his jet neared the gate. the billionaire had spent many of the finest years of his fantastic though far from perfect life in rome, staying at an apartment in the historical center on via vittoria. zurich and his other homes were the places he’d go mostly to work on projects and manage his global commercial pursuits. but rome, well, rome was to fuel his sense of awe. and to nourish his appetite for joy. inhaling the fragrance of gardenias at springtime and taking long treks past the temple that sits at the lake in the park called villa borghese were two of his favorite things in life. rising at am , before rome’s dense traffic could stifle some of its magnificence, and riding his mountain bike past the trevi fountain, up to monti and by the colosseum, and finally over to piazza navona to just sit and embrace the marvelousness of the church in that exalted square, reminded him of the brilliance that only early morning brings. much more than his wealth, such experiences made him feel prosperous. and alive. you should know that the greatest love of his life hailed from rome. the billionaire met her in an english bookstore just off via dei condotti, the fabulous street where italy’s iconic fashion houses have their flagship stores. though he was in his late thirties, the titan was still a bachelor at that first encounter, something of a playboy and a man known for his taste in the finer pleasures of the world. he still remembered the book he sought her help to find: jonathan livingston seagull by richard bach, that wonderfully transformational novel about a seagull who knew he was made to fly higher than the flock and embarked on an unforgettable journey to make that inner knowing real. vanessa put her hands on a copy quickly, was exceedingly polite yet frustratingly aloof and then moved on to help another customer. it took the billionaire over a year of visiting that cramped bookshop with books arranged on old wooden shelves that lined the timeworn walls for this young woman to agree to have dinner with him. the billionaire’s quest was driven by her under-the-radar kind of beauty, her ardent intelligence, her bohemian personal style and her awkward laugh that made him feel as happy as a family of bees in a huge honey pot. they were married in the enchanting seaside town of monopoli, in the southern italian region of puglia. “what a special day that was,” the baron mused wistfully. “the music that rang through the main square as we all danced with wild abandon under the melting glow of a full moon. the farm-fresh burrata cheese, the orecchiette pasta made by the chef’s grandmother. the townspeople joining the lively party, displaying their boundless italian hospitality by bringing bottles of homemade negroamaro and primitivo wine as wedding gifts. the whole experience still touched him considerably. the billionaire’s relationship with vanessa had been both sensational and volatile, as in many epic love stories. sometimes—often, actually—intense romantic connection raises deep-rooted pain. with that special person, we finally feel safe to take off our social armor and show our truest selves. and so, they get to see us in the fullness of our wonder, passion and light. yet, that also brings intense glimpses of the shadow side we all have, the side that develops from the hurts we’ve had, as we’ve lived. in the prophet , kahlil gibran wrote, “when love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep. though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden. all these things shall love do unto you so that you may know the secrets of your heart.” yet, despite the turbulent nature of their marriage, the billionaire and his statuesque wife made it work, for decades. though she had passed away suddenly many years earlier, he never remarried. he wouldn’t allow himself to fall in love again, preferring to concentrate on growing his business empire, expanding his philanthropic pursuits and enjoying the genuinely lovely life he’d earned, alone. the mogul took out his wallet and slowly removed a creased photograph of vanessa. he stared at it, transfixed by the image. then he started coughing again. vigorously. “you okay, boss?” inquired one of the pilots from the cockpit. the billionaire remained silent, looking at the photo. the entrepreneur and the artist had flown to rome a few days earlier and had been mesmerized by the sights, splendor and rarities of the eternal city. with hands locked together, taking in the energy and beauty of rome, they traversed the cobblestone streets previously walked by great builders and noble emperors. today was the day they had waited a long time for. this morning they’d learn the // formula that rested at the core of the am method. the two students would be taught, with granularity, precisely what to do within the victory hour, that window of opportunity that runs between and am , so they’d consistently enjoy amazing days. today they would discover, in intimate detail, how to use their mornings well, to create a world-class existence. as requested by the billionaire, the two"
sharma,"stood at the very top of the spanish steps. it was precisely am . if you stood on the platform under the obelisk that’s there and looked down to the steps beneath it, you’d see the exact spot where the mentor and his two students met on this morning. the first rays of the roman sun kissed trinità dei monti as the lovers looked out over this city of such culture. the early romans were remarkable for the grandeur of their visions, for the scale of their buildings and for their otherworldly ability to construct monuments that betrayed engineering reality. the two of them could see st. peter’s basilica and the tomb of emperor augustus, as well as the seven hills that were so central to the protection of the empire that began as a tiny village on the banks of the tiber river—and grew to what now included forty different countries spanning europe, asia and africa. the air was fragrant with a blend of floral notes and smokiness, as if a fire were burning in the far distance. “buongiorno!” cried a voice amid the tranquility. “own your morning. elevate your life,” the billionaire shouted with the kind of enthusiasm you’d hear from roman soldiers on achieving a crucial victory. mr. riley walked into the first embers of the lightfall, smiling a man in the magic of life type of smile. he had chosen to wear a pair of chic italian sunglasses for this all-important coaching session. he also wore an italian windbreaker over a black t-shirt with the initials spqr emblazoned on it, black sweatpants and orange running shoes. “tutto bene?” he asked cheerfully. “we’re good,” said the entrepreneur, happily, understanding a few words of italian. “really good,” offered the artist. “big day, cats. today’s lesson, to be taught to you by me—your cheese-gulping tonnarelli pasta–gobbling mentor—is all about the // formula . we’re finally here. we’re finally ready to calibrate your morning routine so you both materialize your promise for genius and lead a life of limitless joyfulness. you’ll so love what you’re about to hear. the rest of your life will never be the same,” the illustrious industrialist declared. as the sun slowly ascended, for the first time a tattoo could be seen on the back of the billionaire’s left hand. it had numbers on it. they simply read “//.” the rays of light congregated over his head to give the appearance of a halo. the entire scene was ethereal. you would have been impressed. “is that new?” wondered the artist, showing a clear curiosity. “didn’t notice it before.” “yep,” responded the tycoon. “i had someone in trastevere do it for me last night. cool, right?” spoke the billionaire, appearing as innocent as a newborn. “sort of,” pronounced the artist as he let out a monstrous yawn, then sipped from a takeaway cup of coffee. “great coffee here in italy,” he added. “well, the tattoo is temporary,” admitted the billionaire. “i got it because today’s the // formula day. it really is one of the most important of all our training days together. i feel blessed to be here with you two. i’m starting to feel we’re family now. and to be back in rome is so incredibly special. i stopped coming here after my wife, vanessa, passed away. just hurt too much to be here without her,” he confessed, before looking away. stone riley then dug into a pocket of his sweatpants and pulled out a wishbone. he carefully placed the object on one of the steps that had a series of mysterious drawings on it. just so you know what it looked like, it looked like this: mae besom the billionaire asked his two guests to make a wish, before instructing them to pull it apart as a sign of good luck. “i brought this to our session this morning not only to create even more great vibes for you cats,” continued the billionaire. “i also want you both to remember that a wishbone without a backbone doesn’t really get you very far,” he explained. “sort of the ‘part-time commitment delivers part-time results’ insight we learned earlier?” queried the artist. “and the ‘no idea works without doing the work’ insight,” reinforced the entrepreneur as she did a yoga stretch into the increasing sun. “sort of,” replied the billionaire. “i know you both long to lead productive, excellent, happy and meaningful lives. being a member of the am club truly is the one habit—of all possible habits—that will guarantee this mighty ambition comes true. it’s the single-finest practice i’ve ever encountered to translate the intentions of living gloriously into an everyday reality. yes, dreams and desires are just wishbones. rising before daybreak is your backbone to get them done. “the power of getting up early really comes from the daily application of the // formula ,” the magnate continued. “and you’re now just a few seconds away from being exposed to this astonishingly potent morning routine.” “it really is about time!” said the artist as he put on his own green-lensed sunglasses to shield his eyes from the light which was now beginning to wash into the empty spaces around the spanish steps and down onto the cobblestoned square that features a famous fountain built around bernini’s sculpture of an old boat. “give me a hug before we get going, people!” bellowed the billionaire affectionately as he embraced the artist and entrepreneur. “welcome to my beloved roma!” he added as the song “come un pittore” by the group modà began to play from an open window of a nearby apartment. a curtain hung out of it, flirting with the soft breeze. “okay. let’s rock this piece. please know that your creativity, productivity, prosperity, performance and usefulness to the world as well as the quality of your private life won’t transform by simply rising at am alone. it’s not just rising early that makes this regime so powerful. it’s what you do over the sixty minutes after"
sharma,"you wake up that makes the am club so game-changing. remember this: your victory hour gives you one of life’s greatest windows of opportunity. as you now know, the way you start your day dramatically influences how it unfolds. some people get up early but destroy the value of their morning routine by watching the news, surfing online, scanning social feeds and checking messages. i’m sure you both understand that such behavior comes from the need for a quick pleasure rush of dopamine—an escape from what is truly important. this way of acting causes members of the majority to miss out on doing the things that would allow them to leverage the quietude of this special time to help them maximize greatness so awesome days show up consistently.” “and as we create each day, so we craft our life, right?” asserted the artist, confirming a key piece of information he’d learned on the beach of the billionaire’s oceanfront compound. “that’s the day stacking foundation. and it’s one of the focuses of history-makers that you explained to us. i still remember that model.” “absolutely correct,” applauded the billionaire. “and i need to say that beginning your day intelligently, healthily and peacefully isn’t only about optimizing your public and private success. it’s also about protecting it.” suddenly, a man driving a horse carriage and dressed as a gladiator rolled through the square known as piazza di spagna and shouted, “buongiorno mr. riley,” and then continued on his way. “a dopo,” replied the billionaire loud enough for the man to hear. “gnarly costume, right?” he said to his students. the billionaire rubbed his fake tattoo and looked toward the colosseum. “that man we just saw makes me think of the auriga, a type of slave in ancient rome, who would transport important roman leaders and was chosen for his trustworthiness. here’s the neat thing: another key job of the auriga was to stand behind the military general known as the ‘dux’ and whisper the words ‘memento, homo’ carefully into his ear as he placed the laurel crown on his head.” “what does that mean?” asked the entrepreneur. today she’d dressed in faded jeans, a bright red t-shirt with a v-neck and white running shoes. her hair was styled in the ponytail that she liked. she had her bracelets on. and she absolutely radiated optimism. “‘memento homo’ is latin for ‘remember you are only a man,’” the billionaire answered. “the auriga did this to keep the leader’s arrogance in check and to help the leader manage the inevitable invitation to egotism that all great success inescapably brings. the ritual was a profound discipline to ensure the dux remained monomaniacally focused on his true mission of making himself, and the empire he ruled, even better—and not diluting all his energies on the amusements and excess that cause dynasties to fall.” “you know what?” indicated the artist. “i’ve seen some artistic geniuses blow up their creative empires and destroy their good reputations because they didn’t manage their success properly. so, i hear you.” “def,” said the entrepreneur. “i mean, definitely,” she quickly corrected as she clasped the hand of her new boyfriend. “i’ve seen so many rocketship companies lose their market share because they fell in love with their winning formula. they lost their fire. they got bloated and cocky. they bought into the faulty belief that because there were long lineups for their excellent products, there would always be long lineups—even without iterating their goods, improving customer service and ensuring that every single employee continued to raise their leadership performance. so, i hear you, too, mr. riley.” “awesome,” was his one-word reply. “as you apply the // formula , always remember to keep improving the way you run it each morning. stay hungry. keep a white-belt mentality around it. because nothing fails like success . once you experience how transformational the practice is, it’ll be easy to start coasting—and maybe even neglecting—a few steps of the process.” the billionaire touched an index finger down to one of the steps. he closed his eyes and quietly recited these words: “it’s time to stop being a fugitive from your highest self and accept membership into a new order of ability, bravery and understanding of the call on your lives to inspire humanity.” he then walked across the stone platform atop the spanish steps and raised two fingers of his right hand to show the universal sign for peace. next, he waved an arm in the direction of a man on a seat heating up chestnuts in piazza di spagna, near the foot of via dei condotti. the man wore a gray shirt that had wrinkles over the chest area, navy blue trousers and yellow running shoes. on seeing the sign, the man immediately stood up and darted through the square, up the steps—three at a time—all the way to the peak, where the billionaire was stationed. he lifted his rumpled shirt, revealing a bulletproof vest—and pulled out a laminated sheet of paper from beneath it. “here you go, grande. good to see you back in roma, boss.” the man spoke with a rich italian accent and a voice as gritty as sandpaper. “grazie mille! molto gentile, adriano,” the billionaire said as he kissed the palm of a hand before extending it for a handshake. “adriano’s on my security team,” noted mr. riley while studying the page that had been presented to him. “he’s one of my best. he grew up in the town of alba in the piemonte region of this exceptional nation. you cats like tartufo?” “what’s that?” queried the artist, looking a little confused by the scenario that had just played out. “truffles, baby!” enthused the billionaire. “my goodness, they taste incredible. on tagliolini pasta with melted butter drizzled over it. or when grated over jiggly fried eggs. my, oh my, food of the emperors it is!” the billionaire’s eyes were as wide as a prairie while he imagined the meal he was describing. a"
sharma,"razor thin line of drool meandered out of the right corner of his mouth. yes, a line of drool. beyond weird, right? adriano, who had remained in position, discreetly handed his employer a handkerchief. he looked at the entrepreneur and the artist with a glance that seemed to say, “i know he’s strange, but we love him, too.” and then all four people perched upon that overwhelmingly alluring site started to laugh. together. “have a great morning, boss,” adriano said as he prepared to leave. “i’ll meet you in testaccio this evening. thank you so much for inviting me to eat with you tonight. are we eating cacio e pepe, as usual?” “si,” confirmed the billionaire. “a presto.” “alba is where white truffles come from,” explained the billionaire. “specially trained dogs sniff them out. or pigs. maybe in the future, i’ll take you guys on a truffle hunt with me. i promise you it’ll be unforgettable. anyhoo, have a look at this fantastic learning model. the spellbinder actually deconstructed the victory hour and the // formula for us. zero questions about how to run your morning routine now. no room for excuses. it’s all laid out for you. just run the play and you’ll own your day. procrastination is an act of self-hatred, you know?” “really?” asked the artist. “absolutely. if you really loved yourself, you’d relinquish all your feelings of not being good enough to be great and renounce all slavery to your weakness. you’d stop focusing on your deficiencies and celebrate your amazing qualities. just think about it: there’s no person on the planet today who has the unique stack of gifts that you have. actually, in all of history, there’s never been even one person exactly like you. and there never will be. yes, you’re that special. that’s an indisputable fact. so, embrace the full force of your lavish talent, luminous strengths and breathtaking powers. let go of the destructive habit of breaking the commitments you make to yourself. failing to keep self-promises is one of the reasons so many of us don’t love ourselves. not following through on what we tell ourselves we’ll do so destroys our sense of personal worth and dissolves our self-esteem. keep behaving like that and the unconscious part of you will begin to believe you’re not worth anything. and remember the psychological phenomenon known as the self-fulfilling prophecy i walked you through earlier. we always perform in a way that is aligned with the way we see ourselves. and so, our thinking creates our results. and the less we value ourselves and our powers,” he went on, “the less power we have access to.” the billionaire watched a group of butterflies fly by before continuing. “that’s just the way it all works. so, my suggestion is that you stop putting things off, flex those willpower muscles we talked about inside the taj mahal, and make the remainder of your life an exercise in audacity, a testimony to exceptional productivity and a rare expression of unstained beauty. honor all you truly are by living your genius instead of loathing yourself, by denying your specialness. procrastination is an act of self-hatred,” the billionaire repeated. “so really go all in on installing the // formula as the core way of managing your morning.” the billionaire showed the framework to the entrepreneur and the artist. it looked like this: “as you can see from this learning model, there are three twenty-minute pockets to install and then practice to mastery-level. the first twenty-minute pocket of the // formula requires that you move . simply put, doing some sweaty exercise first thing every morn-ing will revolutionize the quality of your days. the second pocket encourages you to reflect for twenty minutes. this segment is designed to help you reaccess your natural power, boost self-awareness, dissolve your stress, fuel your happiness and restore your inner peace in an era of acute overstimulation and excessive activity. and you’ll round out this sixty-minute victory hour of personal fortification with twenty minutes centered around ensuring that you grow, whether that means investing some time reading a book that will improve your understanding of how the best lives were made or an article that will refine your professional prowess or listening to an audio session on how the virtuosos accomplish their unusual results or watching an educational video that will show you how to lift your relationships or increase your finances or deepen your spirituality. as you cats now know, the leader who learns the most wins. “one of the most helpful things i’ve ever learned from the spellbinder was that starting my mornings with a strong workout—pretty much right after i jumped out of bed—was of the utmost importance. i still remember his actual words—and they were firm: ‘you must begin your day with intense exercise. this is a non-negotiable. otherwise the // formula won’t work. and i’ll take back your membership in the am club.’” three doves flew over the billionaire. he eyed them with a giant grin, blew a kiss to one and then advanced his discourse on the morning routine of history-makers. “training rigorously first thing in the morning is a total game-changer. moving vigorously shortly after you get up will generate an alchemy in your brain—based on its neurobiology—which will not only wake you up fully but electrify your focus and energy, amplify your self-discipline and launch your day in a way that makes you feel on fire. now, to be ultra-practical for you two, i’ll say that your workout could mean taking a spinning class or performing a bunch of jumping jacks and burpees or skipping like the pro boxers love to do or doing wind sprints. not sure what will work best for you. the real key here, though, is to make sure you sweat.” “why?” asked the artist, now taking copious notes. “for the reason you’ll see on the diagram. as you know now, cortisol is the hormone of fear. it’s made in the"
sharma,"cortex of the adrenal glands and is then released into the blood. cortisol is one of the main materials that stunts your genius and devastates your implicit opportunity to make history. very good scientific data confirms that your cortisol levels are highest in the morning.” “fascinating information,” observed the entrepreneur, as she performed another stretch in the roman sunshine. “yes, it is. so, exercising from to : am —for just twenty minutes—will significantly lower your cortisol and, therefore, dial you into your top performance. fantastic way to start a morning, right? science has also shown there’s a vital link between physical fitness and cognitive ability. the sweating from a powerful workout releases bdnf—brain-derived neurotrophic factor—which supercharges that organ for a winning day.” “wow,” said the entrepreneur, also taking notes at a furious pace. “bdnf has been shown to repair brain cells damaged by stress and accelerate the formation of neural connections, so you think better, and process faster,” expounded the billionaire. “another gargantuan competitive advantage, for sure. oh, and it also promotes neurogenesis, so you’ll actually grow new brain cells. what’s that alone worth to you?” “wow times two!” shouted the artist, sounding very corny versus displaying any hint of cool. “my business will be untouchable and i, personally, will become unbeatable as i execute on all these ideas you’re so generously sharing with us,” offered the entrepreneur. modeling what she’d seen mr. riley do when others had been kind to him, she performed a slight bow to show her appreciation. “absolutely,” agreed the billionaire. “and by exercising intensely during the first twenty-minute pocket of the // formula , you’ll also release dopamine, which you well know is the neurotransmitter of drive, along with elevating your amounts of serotonin, the wonderful chemical that regulates happiness. this means that by : am , while your competitors are counting sheep, you’re already amped to lead your field, achieve excellent results and make the day ahead epic.” “would it be possible for you to be specific about what we need to do in order to make sure we’re up with the sun?” requested the entrepreneur. “i mean, can you get into a little bit of detail about what behaviors we must perform so we actually get out of bed when that alarm clock goes off? i hope that’s not a dumb question. is that too basic?” “it’s a great question,” said the artist as he stroked his girlfriend’s back. “it’s a fabulous question!” exclaimed the tycoon. “and sure. like i’ve suggested, buy an old-school alarm clock—that’s what i use. as i said in agra, you never want to sleep with any technology in your bedroom. i’ll explain why soon. once you have your alarm clock, advance the time on it from the actual time to thirty minutes ahead. then set the alarm for : am .” “really?” indicated the artist. “that seems odd.” “i know,” admitted the billionaire. “but it works like magic . you trick yourself into thinking you’re getting up later, but you’re actually rising at am . this tactic just works. so, do it. next, and this sounds obvious but it’s another key hack, as soon as the alarm goes off bolt out of bed before your weaker self sucks you into all the reasons to stay in bed. before your rational mind can come up with reasons to remain under the covers. you just need to make it through that sixty-six-day habit installation process so that waking up at am reaches the automaticity point. and it becomes easier to get up early than sleep later. when i first joined the am club, i slept in my workout clothes.” mr. riley looked slightly embarrassed. then more doves and butterflies passed by. and a wisp of a rainbow could be seen spreading across the spanish steps. “you’re kidding me brother, right?” laughed the artist as he twirled a dreadlock. “you really slept in your exercise gear?” “i did,” admitted the billionaire. “and my running shoes were laid out right next to my bed. i did whatever it took to eliminate the death grip that common excuses could have over me.” the entrepreneur was nodding. she appeared stronger and happier as each day passed. “anyway, let me keep jamming on the point about exercising first thing in your morning. by working out intensely, you’ll stimulate that natural pharmacy of mastery which will make you feel fundamentally different than when you first woke up. the way you feel when you first wake up really isn’t the way you’ll feel only twenty minutes later at : am , when you run this strategy to bulletproof your neurobiology and battleproof your physiology. please remember that! obviously, the sweaty movement also transforms your psychology over time. even if you’re usually a ‘non-morning person’ and grumpy at the beginning of your day, you’ll change—the whole ‘neurons that fire together, wire together’ thing. you’ll feel the confidence every leader without a title needs. you’ll have the focus to stay on task for hours and hours, so you get your most brilliant work done. and you’ll feel much calmer. see, the boost in norepinephrine that fierce morning activity generates not only improves your attention, it leaves you feeling significantly more serene. and more good research proves that exercise regulates the amygdala in the limbic system, the ancient brain we discussed in an earlier class at my beach in mauritius, so that your responses to stimuli ranging from a hard project or a difficult client to a rude driver or a screaming baby are much more graceful instead of hysterical.” “pretty marvelous benefits,” remarked the entrepreneur. “you’re right, mr. riley. i couldn’t put a price tag on having all these weapons of mass productivity in my arsenal.” “precisely,” said the billionaire as he hugged the entrepreneur. “i do love you two,” he added. “i’ll miss you both.” in that moment, the mentor’s usual hopefulness shifted into some unknown sadness. “our time together is coming to an end. maybe we’ll meet"
sharma,"again. i really hope so. but i don’t know …” his voice trailed off, and he looked away again, up at the white church that stood behind where they had gathered, a glorious tribute to the brightest examples of visionary architecture. the billionaire reached into a pocket of his black sweatpants and pulled out a pill, popping it into his mouth like a child consuming a tiny piece of candy. “anyhoo, as you can also see on the deconstruction,” he went on, holding up the model, “working out first thing in the morning also elevates your metabolism—and it fuels the fat-burning engine of your body so you burn any excess more efficiently and lean out more quickly. another valuable triumph, right? oh, and as you optimize your fitness you’ll set yourself up to stay healthy your entire lifetime. ‘train harder. live longer’ is a smart motto i built my empires by. you now know that one of the keys to legendary is longevity. do not die. you can’t own your game and change the world if you’re pushing up daisies in a cemetery,” the titan of industry articulated energetically. “the primary point that i’m trying to offer on the first part of this calibrated versus superficial morning protocol is essentially this: your life will feel and work a hundred times better when you’re in the finest physical condition you’ve ever been in. sweaty exercise as your first move after rising with the sun really is a total life-changer. period. so, do whatever it takes to code in this habit. whatever it takes, cats.” “can i ask you another question, mr. riley?” the entrepreneur asked politely. “go for it,” said the billionaire. “what if i want to exercise for longer than twenty minutes?” “totally cool,” noted the billionaire. “this morning routine isn’t written in stone like those words carved into that obelisk up there,” he added as he pointed up to the monument sitting on a small platform just above the spanish steps. “take all i’m sharing and then make it yours. customize it to fit your preferences and make it bespoke, to suit your lifestyle.” the billionaire inhaled a fresh breath of roman air—the same air the emperors, gladiators, statesmen and craftspeople breathed a thousand years ago. just imagine breathing that air. and standing there with these three fascinating members of the am club. “this brings me to the second twenty-minute pocket of the // formula that you need to run over your victory hour. the time between : and : am is when you ‘reflect.’” “what exactly do you mean by ‘reflect’?” asked the artist, exemplifying his newfound confidence in being a great student. he rubbed his goatee as he voiced the question. his arm rested around the entrepreneur’s shoulder. “as i’ve been suggesting during our time together, managing your morning well is a main skill of exceptionalists. using the front end of your day expertly is such a key determinant of business eminence and personal magnificence. and one element of a cleverly granulated morning routine is a period of deep peace. some quietude and solitude for yourself before the complexity starts arriving, and your family needs your energy, and all your other responsibilities take over. tranquility is the new luxury of our society. so, during this segment of your victory hour, savor some stillness. contemplate how you’re living and on who you hope to become. be thoughtful and intentional on the values you want to be loyal to over the hours ahead of you. and how you wish to behave. consider what needs to happen for this to be a great day amid the construction of a legendary life.” “this pocket will be super-important to me,” remarked the entrepreneur as her bracelets clinked together. one of them was shiny and new. it bore the phrase “all these early mornings will make me an icon someday.” “i agree with you,” expressed the billionaire. “reflecting on what’s most important to a life beautifully lived will leave you with what the spellbinder calls ‘residual wisdom’ throughout the rest of the day. for example, thinking quietly about the weighty value of purely producing work that represents mastery or remembering your commitment to treating people kindly and respectfully during the second pocket re-anchors those virtues within your awareness. and so, as you experience the remainder of your day, the residue of your reconnection with this wisdom stays in focus, infusing every single moment and guiding each one of your choices.” another butterfly flitted by. three more soon followed the first, almost poetically. the billionaire decided to deepen his explanation on reflection, but first popped another pill. he put a hand on his heart and looked at the sensational view of rome. “the way the light falls here really is like nowhere else,” he thought. “i’ll miss my roma.” the billionaire stared down the steps at the white boat sculpted by pietro bernini and then glanced at the flower shop, also in the square below. “in so many ways, reflection is a main source of transformation because once you know better, you definitely can do better. during this twenty-minute segment of the victory hour, all you need to do is get serene, stay silent and enter the stillness. what a gift you’ll give yourself in this era of such scattered attention, worry and noisiness.” “that would be a giant gift to give to myself—and to my business,” acknowledged the entrepreneur. “i’m realizing i spend so much of my time doing and reacting, and so little of my time deliberating and planning. you’ve talked about how the great ones leverage periods of isolation. i’ve read that many famous geniuses had a habit of sitting in solitude for hours with nothing more than a pad of paper and a pen for capturing the insights that would start flashing across the screen of their imaginations.” “yes,” commented the billionaire. “developing a tremendous imagination is a highly important portal into a celebrated fortune. one of the things that"
sharma,"makes the historic sites here in rome so special is the sheer size of the structures. what vision and confidence the romans who created them must have had! and what skill to have turned the ideas into something real. my point is that every single one of the sensational edifices in the eternal city is the product of the imagination of a human being, properly used. so, yes, you should also use the reflection pocket to invent, visualize and dream. ‘twenty years from now,’ a quote i think comes from mark twain says, ‘you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. so, throw off the bowlines. sail away from the safe harbor. catch the trade winds in your sails. explore. dream. discover.’” “all great artists dream about a future few believe is possible,” stated the artist sagely. “yup,” nodded the billionaire. “another tactic you can practice at this time is to write out what the spellbinder calls a pre-performance blueprint . this is simply a written statement of your ideal day ahead. researchers confirm that pre-commitment strategies work beautifully to increase your focus and discipline to get things done. you’ll have a clear and calibrated script for your day ahead, so it unfolds the way you want it to. of course, nothing in business and life is perfect. still, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do our best to pursue it. the heroic women and men of the world were all perfectionists. they were maximizers , immensely obsessed with being remarkable at all they did. so, take at least ten minutes to write out your perfect day.” the mogul peered over at the flower shop again. he raised his left index finger up to the roman sky. a volcanically attractive young woman, with high cheekbones, tortoiseshell glasses, a gray linen blouse and fashionable trousers, stood up, holding a metal attaché case. she then sprinted up the steps like a cheetah chasing its dinner. “hi, vienna,” said the billionaire as she arrived. “salve, mr. riley,” replied the young woman respectfully. “we are delighted to see you back in rome. sir, i have your items.” the aide entered a code into the lock and the case sprung open. inside were three luxuriously crafted journals, bound by the most supple italian leather. the billionaire handed one to the entrepreneur and one to the artist. he lifted the last one, clutched it close to his heart and licked it. yes, he actually licked his journal. “when we’re at the magical vineyards of south africa, i’ll explain why i just ran my tongue over my diary,” the billionaire enthused with ever-increasing mystery. “south africa?” quizzed the artist loudly. “when are we going?” “magical vineyards?” queried the entrepreneur. the billionaire ignored them both. “you’re good, vienna,” spoke the billionaire to his assistant. “really good. ci vediamo dopo,” he added, as she walked down the ancient steps and hopped onto the back of a black scooter that had been waiting for her, before it raced away. as the entrepreneur and the artist opened their journals, they saw a carefully detailed framework on the first page. “another learning diagram for us?” asked the artist in a grateful tone. “si,” noted the billionaire. “brother, i love these models,” the artist said. “priceless teaching tools to make confusing concepts incredibly clear.” “and super-relevant,” added the entrepreneur. “clarity breeds mastery. right?” “truth,” affirmed the industrialist. “and you’re welcome, cats. but it’s been the spellbinder who has invested decades of his rich life creating these frameworks to explain the philosophy and methodology of the am club. they look simple because it’s taken him his entire professional lifetime to handcraft them. it takes long years of extreme attention and ardent isolation to strip away the complexities of any work to reach the simplicity that sits at the touchstone of genuine genius. it’s like when an amateur looks at a masterpiece. it looks simple because he doesn’t comprehend the expertise of the master in taking away all that was unnecessary. removing the non-essentials to produce the gem takes years of dedication. and decades of devotion. making things look simple to the untrained eye is the mark of a maestro.” the learning model in the lavish leather journals looked like this, just so you have a clear sense of what the three companions saw on that sunny morning in rome: “let me get to the point of these gifts my assistant brought us,” the billionaire continued. “during the ‘reflection’ pocket of the // formula , another absolutely winning move is to write in a journal. and so i had these made for you by an italian craftsperson. hope they work wonders for you.” the magnate looked down via dei condotti. street cleaners were hard at work. tourists were strolling along the avenue, taking selfies and buying trinkets from street vendors. “the spellbinder loves hanging with me here in roma. if we’re lucky, we’ll see him later this morning. i know he went running at daybreak along the river to prati before heading off to a fishing excursion at a place a few hours from here. oh, by the way, he formalized writing in a journal for at least a few of the minutes between : and : am with the term ‘daily diaries.’ the key when you do this is just to write. don’t think too much. simply download your commitments for the hours ahead, record your precious ambitions and activate your gratitude by listing what’s good in your life right now. please also use your journal as a place to process through any frustrations, disappointments and resentments in your heart so you let them go. it’s miraculous how you’ll release toxic emotions and low energy from your system when you write down your suppressed hurts, freeing up maximum creativity, premium vitality and unmatchable performance.” “a super way to fireproof and fortify my heartset, right?” said the entrepreneur. “yahoo!” applauded the billionaire, who then placed a"
sharma,"finger upon the learning model on the first page of his journal. “here are some of the rewards you’ll receive when you invest ten or perhaps the entire twenty minutes of pocket number two of your victory hour in writing your daily diaries. and to repeat so i reinforce, i suggest you don’t write only the positive elements of your current life but also those aspects of your experience that are causing discomfort and pain. because the quickest way out of hard emotions is to have the wisdom and courage to go straight into them. feel them to heal them. name them to let go of them. put a written voice to the dark energy of life’s burdens to dissolve them. these are breakthrough insights i’m revealing to you two here. because once you reclaim the power blocked by layers of toxic emotions and the wounds of the past, your mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset will all soar exponentially. and when your four interior empires escalate through your effortful self-purification, your supreme self begins to assume command. this then yields the external empires you both hope to see more of. what i’m trying to explain is this: difficult feelings that you don’t find a healthy way to remove become repressed, which creates stress, poor productivity and even disease.” “cool diagram,” acknowledged the artist. “are you saying that if i don’t feel the uncomfortable feelings, they build up and get stuck inside me to the point where i could get sick?” “yes, what you just said is pretty much what i’m suggesting,” mr. riley confirmed. “those stuck toxic emotions layer over your gifts, talents and higher wisdom. this is one of the primary reasons most people on the planet have forgotten the heroes they are. when we avoid feeling, we lose access to our most powerful selves and forget the truths of life: that each of us can accomplish astounding things, and produce astonishing works, and realize radiant health, and know true love, and live a magical life, and be helpful to many. i speak fact here. but most of us have so much fear, pain, anger and sorrow built up over our real selves, we have no sense of the opportunities that sit right in front of us. all that dark energy blinds us from seeing them. and blocks our access to our primal genius. the great people of history had this access. today, the majority have lost it.” “a magical life?” stated the entrepreneur. “you keep speaking of magic. sounds a little far out. a little granola.” “yes, a magical life,” responded the billionaire firmly, but politely. “i’ll explain how you enter the magic available to all of us when we get to south africa. once you learn what i’ll teach you in the vineyard there, your ability to manifest more money, better health, greater joyfulness and deeper inner peace will grow dramatically. but i can’t share anything about how to live in the magic yet. i’m not allowed to,” commented the billionaire mysteriously. “you need to feel a wound to heal a hurt,” the billionaire continued with precision. “i’ve endured a lot of suffering in my life. business defeats, personal losses, physical failures. i’m actually going through something right now that’s creating sorrow in my heart.” the billionaire’s high-spirited demeanor suddenly began to fade. for an instant, he looked older. he hunched over. and his breathing grew labored. but then he recovered. “anyhoo, the good news,” he said energetically as he raised both arms high into the roman air, “is that i’m not carrying much past pain in my wonderful present and into my fantastic future. i used the daily diary practice during the ‘reflect’ pocket of the // formula to move through and release it all. this skill alone is one of the reasons i’m so full of wonder, gratefulness and peacefulness, most of the time. and how i’ve been able to achieve so much. living in the past steals so much energy from most people, you know? this is a massive explanation for why most people are so unproductive. the spellbinder’s the only person i’ve ever met who made the link between poor performance and emotional turbulence. but think about it. it’s totally true. so imagine what doing your daily diaries each morning will do for your accomplishment and the success of your business, especially as you navigate what you’re going through.” the billionaire spoke with palpable empathy as he placed one lean arm around the entrepreneur and the other over the shoulder of her new boyfriend. “and for your art,” he added, turning to the artist. “and carrying past pain is so exhausting,” the artist agreed. “we all get defeated—and sometimes nearly devastated by life.” the billionaire kept on with his discourse. “i also encourage you to find at least a few moments during the second pocket, between : and : am , to meditate. the spellbinder taught me how to do so, and it has profoundly helped my concentration, my confidence, my performance and the calm that i feel, while running a sophisticated business portfolio. and calm performers are the highest achievers . there’s nothing crackerjack about meditation, so get over any biases you might have around the skill and go ahead and lock it in. it’s simply one of the world’s best ways to strengthen your focus, preserve your natural power and insulate your inner peace. there’s a lot of wonderful science confirming the value of a regular meditation ritual, so, even if you want to dismiss the method, the data says it works—phenomenally—as a human optimization habit. current research proves that regular meditation helps lower levels of cortisol, thus lowering your stress. it’s also a strong way to grow the relationship you have with yourself. you need to make more time for you . to scale your fluency and intimacy with your higher nature. to reconnect with your best part, that side of you that understands the impossible is mostly the untried"
sharma,"and that knows of your hidden reservoirs of luminosity, audacity and love. that portion of you that still can see the greatness in others, even when they behave badly, and that models positivity in the world—even when such virtues are not replied to you. yes, go into this twenty-moment sanctuary of silence and stillness each morning and remember all you truly are . truth speaks in the solitude of the day’s earliest light. and then carry this breathtaking knowledge with you, through the remaining hours of the gift we call a day.” the billionaire fell to the ground. and did a series of rapid push-ups. then, a plank pose followed. you’re now very familiar with this quirky tycoon’s bizarre maneuvers. “i need to get on to the third pocket of the // formula so we can wrap up today’s mentoring session. i’ve got a series of meetings set up for later, and then i’m off to a splendid dinner with adriano, the spellbinder and a few other old friends,” the billionaire said cheerfully. “sure,” said the artist. “no sweat.” “of course,” said the entrepreneur. “we heard about a restaurant close to campo di fiori that makes great carbonara. we’re trying it tonight.” “yummy,” acknowledged the billionaire, sounding more like a five-year-old than a captain of commerce. he then continued his discussion on the morning routine of empire-builders, superachievers and the saviors of our civilization. suddenly, the billionaire clutched his stomach, wincing in pain. “you okay, mr. riley?” the entrepreneur asked as she rushed toward her mentor. “absolutely,” he replied, pretending everything was fine. “let’s keep moving. i’m totally committed to making sure you learn everything that was taught to me about the am club before i leave you. please, just make sure you share the spellbinder’s teachings with as many people as you can. you’ll be improving the world as you do. i might not be able to,” he said as his voice trailed off. “okay,” the industrialist carried on. “let’s keep going. pocket three of the // formula is designed to help you ‘grow’ daily. remember the x x mindset : to double your income and impact, triple your investment in two primary areas, your personal mastery and your professional capability. so, : to : am , the final segment of the victory hour, is when you deepen your base of knowledge, increase your acumen, improve your expertise and outlearn your competition.” “leonardo da vinci said, ‘one can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself,’” said the artist. “i love you even more today,” the entrepreneur said. “well, i adore you more every day,” he replied with a grin. “oh, brother,” laughed the billionaire. “i’m caught in a love fest. right here on the spanish steps.” he closed his eyes and recited these words of stoic philosophy by seneca, the roman statesmen: “‘each day acquire something that will fortify you against poverty, against death, indeed against other misfortunes as well; and after you have run over many thoughts select one to be thoroughly digested that day.’” the billionaire opened his eyes and stated simply, “leadership on the outside begins within.” he added, “during the final pocket, from : to am , of the // formula , work on becoming more valuable, to your industry as well as to society. see, you don’t receive success and influence only because of what you want. you attract it into your life based on who you are —as a person and as a producer. private desire without personal development is like dreaming of having a gorgeous garden but not planting any seeds. we magnetize ourselves to excellent rewards by raising the value of our selves. i made my fortune from this idea. as i improved, my capacity to improve the lives of more people improved through the elevated quality of my service. as i made myself more knowledgeable, i became more valuable to the fields in which i conducted my businesses, which lifted my income and my impact. here’s a concept fairly foreign in today’s age: read a book. study the lives of the greatest men and women of the past by consuming their autobiographies during the ‘grow’ pocket. learn about the latest advancements in psychology. devour works on innovation and communication, productivity and leadership, prosperity and history. and watch documentaries on how the best do what they do—and grew into who they are. listen to audiobooks on personal mastery, creativity and business-building. one of the traits all my billionaire friends and i have in common is we absolutely love to learn. we grow—and capitalize on—our gifts and talents relentlessly. we invest in expanding ourselves—and our pro games—constantly. we are all totally into reading, improving and feeding our limitless curiosity. fun for us is going to a conference together. we go to one, at least one, every three months so we stay inspired, excellent and absolutely switched on. we don’t spend much time on meaningless entertainment because we’re just too invested in endless education. “life is very equitable, you know,” said the mogul, sounding quite philosophical and now looking much stronger. “you’ll receive from it what you give to it. key natural law there. so, give a lot more by becoming a lot better. “okay. so now you have it,” mr. riley summed up exuberantly. “a beautifully engineered, flawlessly calibrated morning routine for a world-class business and personal life. embrace it fully, run it daily, or at least five days a week, and your productivity, prosperity, sense of joy and serenity will accelerate potently along with the value you are able to deliver to our world.” “what’s next?” inquired the artist. “we’ll now go visit the dead,” was the billionaire’s only reply. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club grasps the essentialness of sleep “you cannot imagine the craving for rest i feel—a hunger and thirst. for six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, swift, unprogressive and incessant, a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere,"
sharma,"spinning round swift and steady.” —h.g. wells the roman sun rose even higher as the three companions gazed over the rooftops and at the vatican. the streets were now noisy. the eternal city had come to life. again, the titan’s hand went up into the air. again, one could see another assistant appearing out of nowhere. this time a man who appeared to be in his early forties ran across the square, stood in its center and pulled out a device that he spoke into, quickly and loudly. within a minute, three women with scarves over their hair—like you would see in those wonderful italian films of the fifties—appeared on three sparkling red vespas. they parked them at the foot of the spanish steps, right by the sculpture of the boat, before disappearing down via delle carrozze. “let’s go, people!” exclaimed the billionaire. “it’s time to ride.” “but what’s this about visiting the dead?” asked the entrepreneur, the creases on her forehead reawakened and her arms now crossed. “trust me. hop on your scooter. and follow me,” the billionaire instructed. the three companions wound their way through the ancient streets of rome. even the most unknown church or innocuous obelisk left them in a dreamy state of awe. the sunshine was dazzling now as both the romans and the tourists filled the boulevards. the city felt so alive. in one square they passed, a remarkably talented opera singer with a man standing next to her to collect money touched the hearts of bystanders by singing like she had no tomorrow. as the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist continued their trek along the roads of rome, they saw yet another surreal sight: the pyramid of cestius, built between and bc as a tomb. “an egyptian-style pyramid in the heart of the eternal city. unbelievable,” thought the artist as he tried to keep his eyes on the avenues. soon they were out of the city walls. the billionaire was still leading. the entrepreneur noticed, for the first time all morning, that the back of his t-shirt carried the wise words of benjamin franklin, one of the founding fathers of the united states, who said, “the early morning has gold in its mouth.” and, on the back of his helmet was printed lettering that read, “rise first. die last.” “this man is a marvel,” she thought. “one of a kind.” the entrepreneur knew this sensational adventure would soon be coming to an end. but she hoped mr. riley would remain in her life. she not only had grown to admire him. she felt she needed him. they rode for a while and then the billionaire motioned that they should stop on an eerily desolate side street. after they parked the scooters, without saying a word, he beckoned his students to follow him, past a stone bust of the great roman military general julius caesar, down a series of stairs and into a dark and dusty tunnel. “where the heck are we?” asked the artist. beads of sweat had formed on the delicate skin under his eyes. imagine you were right there with these three human beings. and just picture how the artist looked at this moment. “we’re in the catacombs,” announced the billionaire. “this is where the ancient romans buried their dead. all these subterranean passageways are burial grounds—cemeteries—that date from the second to the fifth century.” “and why are we here?” questioned the entrepreneur. “i brought you to this crypt to make a point,” stated the billionaire in his usual warm tone. at that instant, the sound of footsteps could be heard, coming from the end of the tunnel. the artist glanced at the entrepreneur, eyes wide open. the billionaire didn’t say a word. the footsteps could be heard growing closer. and more forceful. “i don’t have a good feeling,” commented the entrepreneur. the footsteps continued as the hazy light of a candle struck a decrepit wall of the catacomb. then the whole place went quiet. a lone figure slowly emerged, holding a tall candle and with a hood over his head, the kind monks wear. no words were exchanged. it was all extremely mysterious. the intruder stood before the three friends. the candle was raised higher—and moved in four circular motions. then the hood came off. the face that was revealed was a familiar one. a face that had appeared at stadiums across the planet. and one that had inspired many millions to do amazing work, accomplish epic dreams and lead legendary lives. it was the spellbinder. “my god, you scared me,” the artist said, still sweating profusely. “sorry. stone told me to come down here. i got a little lost,” apologized the spellbinder. “extraordinary place, these catacombs. it’s a little creepy in here, though,” he added, looking healthy, happy and relaxed. “hey, buddy,” declared the billionaire as he hugged his adviser and best friend. “thanks for showing up.” “of course,” the spellbinder replied. “well, let me get straight to the insights you wanted me to share with these two. you know i always come to play,” he added with a low five like you see pro basketball players giving teammates after making a successful free throw. “mr. riley asked me to share my thoughts on the value of deep sleep as an element of sustained elite creativity, peak productivity and rare-air performance with you. and he told me he wanted to do it down here because not only are the inhabitants of this crypt in an endless slumber, but science now confirms that one of the primary ways we bring on an early death is by not sleeping enough.” “really?” asked the entrepreneur, folding her arms once again. the light from the candle disclosed a simple silver engagement ring on a finger. “no. you guys didn’t,” gushed the billionaire, glee emanating from his raspy voice. he did a quick, quirky dance move he hadn’t done before. “we did,” the entrepreneur and the artist responded, together. “and you’re both invited"
sharma,"to our wedding. it’ll be small, but special,” the artist added. “you’re welcome to have the ceremony on my beach in mauritius,” offered the billionaire. “heck, i’ll treat you two cats by handling all costs. for you both and for your families and for all of your friends. the whole thing’s all on me. it’s the least i can do for you two new members of the am club. you trusted a crazy-looking old man. you came on this wild odyssey. you’ve been open to all the teachings. you’ve been doing the work. you two are my heroes.” the billionaire let out an urgent cough. perhaps it was from the dust of the passageway. he then placed three fingers against his chest—right where his heart sat. and coughed again. “you okay?” asked the entrepreneur, unfolding her arms and touching one of his muscular shoulders. “yes.” “so,” said the spellbinder, “let me offer some insights on why it’s not only the calibration of the first hour of your day that’s mission essential for leadership excellence and exponential productivity but also the management of the last hour of your evening , if you’re truly serious about experiencing premium results.” he held the candle under his face, creating a near-mystical effect. “what makes genius-level performance is a delicate balance between the mastery of your morning routine and the optimization of your nightly ritual. you won’t be able to orchestrate the // formula stone walked you through this morning if you don’t sleep properly.” “i’m almost always sleep-deprived,” acknowledged the entrepreneur. “sometimes i struggle to function. my memory is off. and i feel exhausted.” “yeah,” agreed the artist. “my sleep’s a mess. i’m up a bunch of times through the night. but since i’ve been on this trip, i’ve slept good each night.” “that’s great to hear. because we’re in midst of a ferocious global sleep recession,” vocalized the spellbinder, clearly articulating the dramatic languaging he’d become internationally known for. “the internet and social media and the widespread absorption with our devices are fueling much of it. research is now confirming that the blue light emitted from our tools of technology reduces the amount of melatonin within us. melatonin is the chemical that informs your body that it needs to get sleep. there’s zero doubt that checking your gadgets all day long impairs cognitive function, as you’ve learned. and there’s no question at all that being in front of your screens before bedtime causes sleep dysfunction. i could go deeper and explain how the light of your devices activates photoreceptors called ‘intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells’ that limit melatonin production and negatively affect your circadian rhythm, which hurts your sleep—but you get my point here.” “i do,” confirmed the entrepreneur. “i really do. i’ll restructure my pre-sleep routine so that i wake up at am feeling better and full of energy. i promise to do this so i rest well and so i can implement the // formula flawlessly.” “for the day minimum— until it becomes an automatic habit,” interjected the artist. “and then for the rest of my life, so it actually becomes easier to run the am method than to stay in bed sleeping.” “when we don’t sleep enough,” the spellbinder picked up, “not only is it fiercely difficult to get up early, but a number of other highly damaging things impair your productivity and minimize your performance along with reducing your happiness and eroding your health.” “tell us,” requested the entrepreneur. “yes, tell them,” encouraged the billionaire, now squatting in the catacomb. “this posture’s really good for your lower back as well as for your digestion,” he added, oddly. “well, when you sleep—and the key here is not only the quantity of sleep but the quality of your sleep states—your neurons shrink by % as cerebral spinal fluid washes through your brain. it’s also been discovered that the lymphatic system, which was previously believed to be only in your body, is in your skull, too. all this means that we, as human beings, have evolutionarily architected a powerful process to essentially wash the brain so it stays in optimum condition. and this cleansing mechanism only happens while we sleep.” “unbelievably interesting,” the entrepreneur noted. “tell them about hgh,” implored the billionaire. “sure,” said the spellbinder. “hgh, human growth hormone, is produced in the pituitary gland of the brain and is important for healthy tissues in your body, a strong functioning metabolism and a long lifespan. increased levels of hgh raise your moods, cognition, energy levels and lean muscle mass, while reducing your cravings through the regulation of leptin and ghrelin. here’s the main point: while hgh is released through exercise, which is part of the reason pocket number one of the // formula is such a game-changer, % of hgh production happens when you sleep! and here’s the real key: to maximize the process of the brain being washed properly and hgh being produced excellently so you expand your creativity, productivity, vitality and longevity, you need five complete ninety-minute sleep cycles. that’s what the scientific studies are now confirming. that’s seven and a half hours of sleep each night. you also should know that research proves that it’s not only sleep-deprivation that kills. over-sleep, nine or more hours, also has been shown to shorten life.” “do you have a learning model for us that explains all this, so our awareness gets super-clear and calibrated versus vague and lame?” asked the artist. “good job, stone. you taught them the step success formula, ” applauded the spellbinder. the billionaire, still near to the dirty floor of the crypt, nodded. then he burped. “yes, i do have a framework for you,” confirmed the spellbinder. “i’ve deconstructed my own evening routine that has helped me consistently sleep wonderfully over all these years.” the spellbinder then pulled out a flashlight that had been hidden in his robe. he unscrewed the top portion, revealing a secret compartment in the tube. from it, he extracted two thin scrolls,"
sharma,"handing one to the entrepreneur and the other to the artist. the following diagram appeared on each scroll: “i don’t know how to thank you,” the entrepreneur said. “both of you,” she indicated, looking over to the billionaire, who was now doing sit-ups in the candlelight while whispering, “great fortune and weighty wisdom keep coming my way. i’m always a leader, never a victim. a lion, not a sheep. i love my life and am making it even better every day. and the more people i help, the more happy i am.” “i second my beloved’s gratitude,” commented the artist. he reached over and lovingly stroked the entrepreneur’s hair. “if the world knew and applied the philosophies and methodologies of the am club, every human being alive would transform,” the entrepreneur reinforced. “and i now get that awakening with the sun isn’t at all about getting by on less sleep. it’s more the old ‘early to bed, early to rise’ point.” “and as each of us does our part to make our personal revolutions, every relationship in our life—from the one we have with our craft to the connections we share with each other—improves with us,” offered the artist. “sort of like mahatma gandhi’s words ‘be the change you wish to see in the world,’” added the entrepreneur, her face glowing in the soft light of the candle as she rubbed her new ring. “i read a little about his life before i went to sleep last night.” “with all due respect,” pronounced the spellbinder compassionately, “mahatma gandhi’s actual words have been adjusted over the years, to become a sound bite that suits a culture experiencing a collective deficit of attention.” “what he actually said,” interrupted the billionaire, “was, ‘if we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. as a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change toward him. we need not wait to see what others do.’” “awesome job, stone,” remarked the spellbinder, smiling. “but i do appreciate your larger point,” he said kindly to the entrepreneur. “and, of course, you’re right. my personal ask of both of you is that you’ll share as many of the principles and mental models as you can with as many people as possible. because, yes, if every business leader, commercial worker, scientist, artist, architect, political influencer, sports performer, teacher, mother, firefighter, father, taxi driver, daughter and son simply installed the morning routine and nightly ritual we’ve shared with you, we’d have a whole new world . a lot less sadness, rudeness, mediocrity and hate. and so much more creativity, beauty, peacefulness and love. “and now, i need to leave,” announced the spellbinder. “see you tonight at dinner, stone. cacio e pepe’s on the menu, right?” “of course,” replied the billionaire as he stood up. he began to cough again and appeared unsteady for a moment. his left hand trembled. a leg wobbled. the spellbinder quickly looked away. “i need to go,” was all he said before dissolving into the darkness of the tomb. the three who remained made their way out of the crypt, back up the stairs and into the blinding roman sunlight. the billionaire started his scooter and waved for his guests to follow. they ventured down a maze of narrow streets, past an antiquated aqueduct and back through city walls. soon they were navigating the congested streets of the historical center and traveling down via dei condotti. after parking their scooters, the entrepreneur and the artist followed the billionaire up the spanish steps. “well,” he declared. “this brings us full circle to where we began this morning’s mentoring session at am. before i let you cats go for today, i have one last super-gnarly model for you two. the spellbinder taught it to me when i was much younger, and it proved itself to be priceless. i know it’ll wrap up this morning’s teachings with a very neat bow.” the billionaire clapped his hands with a thunderous whap . a whirring noise could be heard in the distance, emanating from villa borghese. soon, the sound grew louder. and closer. an object hovered above the heads of the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist. tourists sitting on the spanish steps, sipping espresso and eating gelato, turned their eyes toward the heavens, trying to figure out what was going on. you would have enjoyed being there, at that fabulous moment. “mamma mia,” cried an elderly woman in a free-flowing flowery dress. she was holding a baby in one arm and a bouquet of glamorously colored tulips in the other. “it’s a drone!” yelled a teenage boy sporting a snapback cap, a denim jacket with “doubt is not an option” stitched into the back of it and ripped jeans with humongous holes at the knees. for some unknown reason, he was barefoot. the billionaire began to expertly pilot the little aircraft to a precise landing as smooth as the surface of a lake on a sweltering summer afternoon. he winked at his two students. “still got the gift,” he beamed. the drone carried a wooden box that, when opened, contained a thin sheet of glass with a learning model on it. here’s what the diagram on the glass looked like: “i thought you guys would find this very detailed step-by-step game plan for an amazing day valuable. of course, this is just one possible way to carve it out. you’ll notice the evening regime is a little different from the spellbinder’s. as usual, how you apply all these tactics we’ve shared is completely up to you. it’s your life—live it as you choose. and yet, this particular framework helped me tremendously because it took many of the powerful elements of the // formula i walked you through earlier this morning along with key aspects of a world-class pre-sleep process and built them into an immensely specific daily map that anyone—and i do mean anyone—can run to experience amazing days, consistently. it’s like"
sharma,"a food recipe: follow the steps, and you’ll get the results.” “and amazing days create an upward spiral into amazing weeks and amazing weeks morph into amazing months,” stated the artist, closing his journal. “and amazing months become amazing quarters and amazing quarters yield amazing years and decades and ultimately …” added the entrepreneur, closing her journal. “an amazing lifetime,” the three said together. “day by day. step by step, an epic existence gets handcrafted,” summed up the billionaire, wearing his fashionable shades, the kind the in-the-know romans sport in their effortlessly stylish way that displays an “i don’t try too hard to look this phenomenally cool” kind of attitude. more seagulls flapped their wings and made those annoying sounds seagulls seem to enjoy making. the billionaire was clearly an exceedingly loving soul. not just rich in money, but also wealthy of heart. but he did detest seagulls and the way they had done a takeover of many of the rooftops in the core of rome, over the past few years. “need to do something about those feathered creatures,” he ruminated, displaying uncharacteristic irritation. “anyhoo, now you know why i brought you to the spanish steps. generating explosive productivity, elite health, exceptional prosperity, sustained joy and boundless inner peace really is a step-by-step game. small, daily, seemingly insignificant improvements, when done consistently over time, do yield staggering results. daily micro-wins and infinitesimal optimizations really are the surest way to a life that you’ll be ever so proud of at the end. this truly is one of my favorite places in the world, you know. i wanted you two to be with me to not only teach you the transformational process of the // formula , but also to reinforce the reality that living remarkably is indeed an upward spiral to the top of a staircase of success and significance. and as you take this journey toward the fullest experience of your highest greatness, step by step, a magic and beauty as obvious as you now witness here will infuse your days and only accelerate over your years. of this you can be sure.” after carefully scanning the learning model on the glass, the entrepreneur wondered aloud, “what’s the // rule ? and the / method ? and i don’t understand some of these other notations.” “and what do ‘ww’ and ‘mp’ on the framework stand for?” asked the artist. “you’ll learn soon enough,” the billionaire responded, generating suspense. “you both should know i’ve saved the best— and most valuable —teachings for the end of our time together.” the billionaire then hugged the entrepreneur and the artist, tighter than ever before. they could see tears slowly filling his eyes. big whales of water. “i love you two,” he said. “ci vediamo.” and then he vanished. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club is mentored on the tactics of lifelong genius “if you knew how much work went into it, you would not call it genius.” —michelangelo “s ão paulo is so special, isn’t it?” said the billionaire as the unmarked and economy-class car navigated by a driver in short sleeves stopped and started through the thick traffic of this city of many millions. as in mauritius, he sat in the front passenger seat. the three companions had just landed at the jetport and were heading to a boutique hotel in the center of this financial capital of latin america. “it’s a big city,” noted the artist, offering another blinding glimpse of the obvious. “we so appreciate you flying us down here to brazil for our wedding,” the entrepreneur enthused. “thanks, brother,” the artist added. “he really wanted the ceremony to take place at your compound by the ocean,” said the entrepreneur, pointing to her fiancé with a warm look. “i did,” stated the artist agreeably. “that place was paradise.” “and, to be honest, i did too. but i wanted to honor my father, given that he was brazilian,” the entrepreneur explained. “and a happy wife means a happy life,” confirmed the artist with a grin. he then quoted the words from a.a. milne’s winnie-the-pooh : “if you live to be a hundred, i want to live to be a hundred minus one day so i never have to live without you.” the entrepreneur moved closer to the artist in the back of the car as it sailed past magnificent neo-gothic cathedrals, along great avenues with towering high-rises, down a thoroughfare that showcased the impressive theatro municipal de são paulo and across a roadway where the majestic ibirapuera park sat. what the artist shared made the billionaire think of his wife. he still thought of her every day. and it wasn’t the luxurious trips to exotic places that he most recalled. nor the beautiful meals at the world’s best restaurants. his mind drifted to the simplest and most apparently ordinary of moments in her company. sharing a cheap but excellent pizza with olive oil drizzled over it. reading books in silence in front of a dazzling fire. nature walks and movie nights and trips to the grocery store. dancing in their bedroom to music that reminded them of how much they adored each other. and things like how patiently she taught him italian, the way she’d snort when she’d laugh really hard—and how utterly devoted she was to their only child. life’s finest treasures live in its simplest moments , contemplated the billionaire. in those daily occurrences that most of us take for granted. until we lose them. lifting his hand to proudly display his engagement ring, the artist continued to express the depth of his love while the car rolled along. “i love her hard, man,” he spoke to mr. riley. “she’s my sunrise. my art used to be all that mattered. didn’t have much of a need for anyone around me, you know. guess i never knew what real love was. can’t imagine living without her now.” the entrepreneur considered how blessed she was. in the period since she attended the"
sharma,"spellbinder’s event, her mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset were being reordered and upgraded. radically. and irrevocably. she was releasing the limiting beliefs that had been forged from her tumultuous childhood and letting go of the toxic emotions that grew out of her past traumas, as well as from the current predicament with her investors. the billionaire was quite right, she was realizing to an even deeper degree: we each do the best we can based on the level of awareness, maturity and personal security we are at. people who hurt others really are hurting within themselves. they are behaving in the wisest way they know how to behave. if they were capable of conducting themselves with greater leadership, generosity and humanity, they would have done so. this profound insight had sown even stronger seeds of forgiveness within the entrepreneur. when she first heard the spellbinder at his seminar, she was cynical and resistant to a lot of his teachings. she’d since pivoted considerably and was now embracing everything she’d been fortunate enough to learn, wholeheartedly. it was an inspirational evolution to see. it had been three weeks since the visit to rome. in that time, the entrepreneur had been doing wind sprints for twenty minutes at am each morning along with some serious weight training. after that at, : am , she’d use the tranquility of the second pocket to contemplate quietly, write lists of the things she was grateful for in her new journal and then meditate. finally, at : am , she’d listen to an audiobook about a business maverick or read something on the subjects of productivity, teamwork and leadership. she’d also, and this was a hard one, broken the addiction to technology that had been her lifeline—as well as her escape from producing her greatest work. and her diversion from being fully present to life. during these fantastic days away from her office, she’d been creating the brightest output of her career, leveraging the phenomenon of transient hypofrontality the billionaire had taught her to orchestrate results at a level of genius she’d never experienced before. and reclaiming the sense of inner well-being she’d lost. everything she was applying was delivering enormous rewards. everything in her life seemed to be clicking again. she was fitter than she’d been in years, happier and more serene than she’d ever known, and more productive—during the periods she was away from the artist, conducting business—than she’d imagined she could be. all thanks to the am club, which she understood, more and more, allowed her to protect her natural talents in a commercial world of such noise, stress and invitation to relentless interruption. the victory hour was providing her with an insulated period, at the front end of her day, to build her four interior empires. so she could construct outer ones. with her newfound hopefulness, confidence and forgiveness, she’d even made excellent progress in negotiating a solution with her investors. she was excited that, shortly, the whole horrible ordeal would be behind her. and soon, she’d be married. she’d always wanted someone special to share in her delights and successes. and she’d always wished to balance her hunger for fortune-making with her dream of having a family. the kind of family she’d missed being part of as a girl. just as the entrepreneur was about to respond to the artist’s musings on the extent of his love, a gunshot rang out. the glass of the vehicle’s windshield shattered, instantly looking like a spider’s web. two broad-shouldered men in ski masks, with machine guns over their shoulders, violently motioned for the driver to unlock the doors. when he attempted to accelerate out of harm’s way, another bullet pierced the glass, grazing the chauffeur’s ear and prompting an outburst of blood. “open the door,” instructed mr. riley, stunningly calmly. “i’ve got this,” he said as he secretly pressed a red button strategically located under the glove compartment. the doors unlocked. you could hear a click . speaking in staccato bursts, one of the gunmen screamed, “everyone out of the car. now! or you die!” as the occupants of the car followed the orders, the other gunman grabbed the entrepreneur by the neck. “we told you to leave the firm. we told you we’d kill you. we told you this was gonna happen,” he said. suddenly, a long suv, the sort you see combat leaders in war zones traveling in, raced up to the scene. four more people, two men and two women, in flak jackets with pistols raced up on sleek motorcycles. the billionaire’s protection team had arrived. fighting broke out in the street, knives were pulled and more shots were fired. the billionaire was whisked away with an efficiency that was striking. he still appeared unruffled and, as if he were a general leading a military mission, said simply, “save my passengers. they are my family members.” a helicopter was now floating overhead. yes, a helicopter. it had “ac” in large orange letters on the side of it, over white paint. the magnate’s security squad quickly disarmed the larger of the two gunmen, the one who had threatened the entrepreneur, and removed her to the safety of the waiting suv. but the artist, well, sadly he was gone. “i need to find him!” the entrepreneur screamed at the personnel in the armored vehicle. “i need to find my husband,” she added, clearly in a state of acute shock over the entire scenario. “stay here,” ordered one of the security agents, firmly, holding her by the arm. but the entrepreneur, in her newly created state of mental toughness, physical fitness, emotional resilience and spiritual fearlessness—thanks to her new morning routine—broke free from the burly guard, kicked open the door that had been left slightly ajar and started to run. like an elite athlete, she sprinted deftly across a highway with traffic speeding down four lanes. horns blared, and some passionate brazilians shouted words in portuguese, concerned for her welfare. but she kept running,"
sharma,"as fast as a gazelle. she ducked into a café. no sign of her man. then into a restaurant. next she raced along a street renowned for its steak houses. the artist was nowhere in sight. then the entrepreneur spotted his notebook, the one in which he had made all his notes from the lessons of the spellbinder and the billionaire. the same notebook she saw him clutching tightly when they first met, seemingly randomly, in the conference hall—when she was at the darkest place of her life. and he, as an angel of sorts, made her feel safer, calmer and happier by his loving presence. what happened next was tragic. as the entrepreneur slowed down to a walk and turned onto a thin slice of an avenue, she saw blood. not a pool of blood but drops and specks of fresh blood. “oh, god. oh, god. please, no,” she cried out. frantically, she continued following the trail, pushing past a series of parked cars, a mother with a baby in a stroller and a line of elegant houses. “please don’t let him die,” the businesswoman prayed. “please, god.” “i’m here. over here,” a squeaky voice rang out. the entrepreneur darted in the direction of the artist’s calls. growing closer, she spied the gunman holding a revolver directly to the head of her fiancé. the thug had removed his ski mask. one could see that he was young. and looked extremely scared. “look,” declared the entrepreneur, behaving courageously and slowly walking over to the two men. “look,” she repeated. “i know you don’t want to hurt him. i know you don’t want to spend the rest of your life in a prison cell. just give me the gun and you can go. i won’t say a word to anyone about you. just give me the gun.” the gunman was frozen. speechless. and shaking. slowly he turned the gun away from the head of the artist. and aimed it squarely at the chest of the entrepreneur. “just relax,” she implored in a fierce yet empathetic voice. she continued walking toward her fiancé and the kidnapper. “i’ll kill you,” shouted the bandit. “stay there.” the entrepreneur took step by careful step while staring directly into the eyes of the gunman. she now had a soft smile on her face. such was the grade of her newly earned bravery. so was the degree of her considerably enhanced confidence. after a long pause, the criminal stood up. he stared at the entrepreneur with what looked like a combination of mountainous respect and visceral disbelief. then, he hurried away. “baby, are you okay?” the entrepreneur embraced the artist tenderly. gathering his composure, though perspiring unstoppably, he replied, “born okay, baby. born okay. um. you just saved my life, you know?” “i know,” she said. “i didn’t do it because we’re about to be married, you know. i didn’t save you because i love you.” “what?” questioned the artist. “then why did you do what you just did? i mean, that was incredible what you just pulled off! totally gangster.” “i did it because of the club.” “what are you talking about?” asked the artist, bewildered. “i did what i did because of the powers i’ve developed as a member of the am club. that’s how i was able to do what i just did. it all really works. all of it. everything we’ve been taught in mauritius. in india. in rome. and the main reason i saved your life isn’t because you’ll soon be my husband and we’ll have great kids and then grandkids and a bunch of dogs and cats and hopefully even canaries at our home,” she gushed. “no. i saved you only because you’re also in the club. and mr. riley said we have to stick together. and to have each other’s backs.” “are you serious?” asked the artist, loudly. he wasn’t pleased with what he’d heard. “of course not! i’m just playing, babe,” laughed the entrepreneur. “i adore you. i’d give my life for you any day of the week. now let’s go find mr. riley. let’s make sure he’s okay.” the next day, after they had recovered from their dramatic experience, they met in the billionaire’s penthouse at the chic hotel. mr. riley looked lean, focused and very happy. “quite the spree yesterday, cats,” he stated in a way that suggested that what they’d endured was nothing more than a brisk walk through a flower-filled park. “that was brutal,” the artist replied. “you talk about trauma—that was traumatic.” “you, my friend, were quite the hero yesterday,” declared the billionaire proudly while focusing on the entrepreneur. “you, young lady, are a miracle on two legs.” “thanks,” she said, shifting her feet a bit and making sure the artist was okay. “i watched you roll. i saw your cool. i noticed your concentration under extreme pressure. and your superhuman levels of performance.” “this goddess of a woman here saved my life,” the artist acknowledged enthusiastically. “you two love cats are just beginning to get a taste of the benefits of joining the am club. just imagine you two after applying the day minimum. then after six months of running the world-class morning routine you’ve now discovered. consider the way you’ll capitalize on your potential, optimize your performance—and be useful to our world in a year. always remember that the greatest of leaders were all servant leaders. the less you make it all about you, and the more your obsession focuses on the upliftment of others, the more you’ll increase your identity as a genuine empire-builder. and grow into a history-maker.” “got you,” confirmed the entrepreneur as she sipped from a water bottle, making sure she was well hydrated to stay at her energetic best. “i want to reward you for the heroism you showed yesterday,” the billionaire offered. “i have some news that i think will make you love your life even more.” “tell me, please,” the entrepreneur said. “though i really"
sharma,"don’t need anything, you know. i did what i did out of love. simple as that.” “well … are you ready?” the tycoon asked. “yes. ready.” “well, this morning i had my people buy up all of the equity those nasty investors owned. let’s just say i made them an offer they couldn’t refuse. and my legal team had them sign an agreement promising they will never go near your company again and are not permitted to come anywhere near you … or the man who will be your husband in a few short hours. “gnarly, right?” the billionaire spoke as he tap danced his way across the floor of the penthouse. yes, he actually tap danced across the entire room. next, he began flailing his arms manically and grooving intensely to his imagined music. finally—get this—he started twerking. yes, the illustrious industrialist who was worth over one billion dollars was twerking in that hotel suite. “he’s the weirdest human being i’ve ever met—by a factor of a million,” thought the entrepreneur. “but truly wonderful. and pretty close to magical.” the entrepreneur and the artist looked at each other and began to giggle. they then joined in—as best as they could, because mr. riley could sometimes be a bit of a showman, as humble as he was. after the dancing session they hugged this man who had become their magnificent mentor, exuberant encourager and sincere friend. the entrepreneur thanked the eccentric baron, profusely, for his generosity in making her difficult situation go away. this spectacular escapade was taking on a near-mystical quality. everything was improving. all was unfolding even better than she could have dreamed. and now she was free of the very trial that had brought her to the sharpest edge of her life. in that moment, she realized that on the other side of every tragedy lives a triumph. and beyond adversity exists a bridge into enduring victory, if one has the eyes to see it. “anyhoo,” said the billionaire, “today’s session will be a quick one. “my chief of staff is attending to every detail of your wedding as we speak. you’ll have the casablanca lilies you requested, the music you both suggested and every detail will be calibrated to world-class. it’s just the way my team and i roll. oh, all your guests have been flown in on a series of my jets. everybody’s here. and everyone’s full of delight. especially me.” the titan let out another intense cough. and then two more. his arm started to tremble again as he sat on a modern-looking wooden chair covered by a swatch of white leather, the kind furniture craftspeople in sweden and denmark make. for the first time, a look in his eyes revealed hues of fear. “i’ll beat this monster,” he whispered to himself. “you’re messing with the wrong dude.” he pulled out his wallet, extracted the worn picture of his wife, gone so long ago, clasped it to his heart and centered himself on the essential points of the morning’s discourse. “now that you know most of what you need to know about the am method, i want to offer ten tactics that will quicken your momentum in both your professional and your private lives. these are ten gestures for daily heroism. the // formula will help you use your mornings brilliantly. these ten other routines will complement the regime, so the rest of your day unfolds gloriously. lock these in and you’ll become undefeatable. and experience a meaningful upward spiral of success where every important element of your life rises as your hours pass.” as usual, a hand then went up into the air. out of the library of the penthouse suite sprang an assistant, struggling to carry what appeared to be a large framed art piece. the billionaire jumped up and rushed over to help his aide. on the front of the white t-shirt the young, fit and unfairly handsome assistant wore were these printed words: “everyone dreams of being a legend until it comes time to do the work that legends do.” “this is one of my wedding gifts to you two.” the billionaire pointed to a breathtaking painting of thomas edison, the great inventor. over edison’s face, in an edgy modern art script, were the inventor’s words: “the best thinking has been done in solitude. the worst has been done in turmoil.” “i commissioned one of my favorite artists, who lives in berlin, to do this for you. he did a lot of the artwork in my zurich flat. he hardly paints anymore. did this as a special favor. you cats could retire if you sold it—trust me on that one. please flip it over,” requested the billionaire politely, sitting down on the sleek chair again and surveying the expansive penthouse that overlooked the skyscrapers of são paulo. many of the high-rises had helipads on top of them so the icons of industry who operated within them could skirt around without having to waste precious hours of productivity—and life—sitting in são paulo traffic. because as you now know, the hours most people waste epic performers exploit. on the back of the immaculately framed artwork was a chart with this title on it: the tactics of lifelong genius . the billionaire continued talking. “thomas edison exemplifies prodigious creative achievement like few others in history, having recorded one thousand and ninety-three patents over his lifetime and giving us everything from the lightbulb to the motion picture camera and, in , a battery that was later used for electric cars. he wasn’t only an inventor. he was also a stratospheric company builder. “yup,” the billionaire continued. “his life is absolutely worth studying and then deconstructing in your journal so your intimacy and fluency with how he did it grows. edison once said, ‘being busy does not always mean real work. the object of all work is production or accomplishment.’ “and as you granulate the inventor’s achievement formula, please go deep on studying his ability"
sharma,"to focus. edison also observed, ‘you do something all day long, don’t you? everyone does. if you get up at seven o’clock and go to bed at eleven, you have put in sixteen good hours, and it is certain with most men, that they have been doing something all the time. the only trouble is that they do it about a great many things and i do it about one. if they took the time in question and applied it in one direction, to one object, they would succeed.’” “that’s on point,” observed the artist, who was dressed in black gear this morning and wearing his standard issue combat boots. he’d shaved off his trademark goatee. “it goes to the point you made in mauritius about us waking up with a limited amount of cognitive bandwidth and every distraction that steals our attention lowers our chance to do masterful work. because we leave attention residue on every diversion that we allow into our workplace—and lifespace. and if we’re not really careful, we’ll end up with the digital dementia referred to on the last diagram you shared with us in rome. i’m getting this piece in a pretty big way today. when i get back home to my studio, i’m definitely going to set up my environment up so it’s totally quiet. zero devices. i also plan to do a big-time technology detox. no social media and no cyber surfing for at least a few weeks, so i get my concentration back. what i’m understanding is that once i’m in the clear space of silence, i should focus only on one project at a time, not spread out my creative power and physical energy on many. that’s what i take from edison’s words. don’t diffuse my genius on being pretty good at many things when i have it in me to be legendary by working intensely only on one thing.” “and i’m realizing that even one interruption when i’m thinking about a hot new product or my next blue ocean venture could cost me many millions of dollars—or more,” said the entrepreneur excitedly. “what you two just said is massively important if you are serious about leveraging your talents and expressing the fullness of your inherent greatness,” the billionaire affirmed as he beamed cheerfully. “edison would climb up the hill to his menlo park laboratory and work for hours and hours, and sometimes days upon days, with his team on the one invention that was the center of their inspiration. that groovy cat was a pretty gnarly dude.” the billionaire then pointed to the chart on the back of the painting. “i know you both need to get going, so you can get ready for the ceremony. kindly take this gift with you. but first, read what it says here on the back, so you start the process of wiring in these ten tactics that will accelerate your progress in the am club and set your gifts, talents and powers ablaze. rising at dawn and running the // formula is your main move to lead your field and upgrade your personal life. these ten calibrated habits are your amplifiers. they’ll ensure that you go from seeing results that are linear to rewards that are exponential.” the learning model looked like this: under the tactics of lifelong genius model, the entrepreneur and the artist read the following list of strategies along with precise explanations about what they mean. and how one was to apply them. tactic #: the tight bubble of total focus (tbtf) the insight: an addiction to distraction is the death of your creative production. your attraction to digital interruption is costing you your fortune—financially, cognitively, energetically, physically and spiritually. to have the income and impact only a few people currently have, you need to run your days like very few performers currently do. the tight bubble of total focus is a metaphorical moat that you build around your assets of genius, so they not only stay strong—they increase. the five primary assets that all superproducers defend are mental focus, physical energy, personal willpower, original talent and daily time. your bubble has a porous membrane that encircles it so that you decide what information, which people and the nature of the activities that enter your orbit. anything negative, toxic and impure gets blocked at the gate. essentially, this way of being in the world is your bulletproof defense system to reject any stimuli that would decry your greatness. the implementation: the tight bubble of total focus strategy preserves your focus as well as your primal brilliance by giving you long stretches of time free from trivial fascinations and any influences that dissolve your inspiration—and deteriorate your a-game. each morning, you enter this invisible bubble of your own making that is completely empty of other people’s superficial messages, spam, fake news, advertisements, silly videos, irrelevant chatting and other forms of cyber-hooking that will destroy your life of monumental potential. part of this philosophical construct is your personal menlo park, the place where—like thomas edison—you get lost from the world and go to generate the masterworks that will raise you to industry dominance and global eminence. the real key here is solitude for a scheduled period each day, in a positive environment that floods you with creativity, energy, happiness and the feeling the work you’re doing is for the upliftment of humanity. the spaces you inhabit shape the output you produce. this concept can—and should—also be applied beyond your professional routine. so your private time is free of negativity, energy vampires and soul-hurting pursuits. of course, tinker with this metaphorical wall of armor around your five assets of genius so you have a wonderful social life. and so you don’t become a hermit. using the tbtf in your personal life means you live your days in an alternate universe of your own joyous creation. remember, the bubble has a porous membrane, so you can carefully choose who you allow into your private"
sharma,"reality as well as the elements of beauty, wonder and peace. specific application ideas include selling your television, avoiding the news for the remainder of your days, staying out of noisy shopping malls where you buy things you don’t need, unfriending energy-draining people you follow on social platforms, turning off all notifications while you’re in the tbtf and deleting apps with constant announcements. tactic #: the // rule the insight: doing real work versus artificial work, daily and with absolute consistency, will give you a gargantuan competitive advantage born of mastery. productivity of virtuoso-level quality is rare. and the marketplace pays most for something that is scarce. legendary achievers concentrate all their attention and effort on one core project at a time so they harness the fullness of their cognitive capacity and their precious energy on releasing glorious products that turn their industry on their head. to work like this, you need to install the daily habit of exploiting your best professional hours to offer your finest productive results. when you show up for work, it’s not the time to shop online, to gossip or to check messages. it’s showtime. for the superproducer. the implementation: for the next ninety days, schedule yourself to invest the first ninety minutes of your workday on the one activity that, when completed at world-class, will cause you to own your field. this ninety-minute period must be completely free of any noise and interruptions. place your devices in a bag marked, “for my // period.” and then leave that bag in another room. installing clear boundary fences that block access to temptations is a potent tactic to decrease them. tactic #: the / method the insight: research supports that the greatest performers don’t work in a linear way—working harder and longer with the hope of arriving at stronger and better results. instead, the way elite creatives do what they do is by understanding the power of oscillation. they structure their work cycles so that they alternate bursts of deep focus and ferocious intensity of performance with periods of real rest and full recovery. in other words, they work in a balance—and cycle awesome output with times to refuel their assets of genius so they don’t deplete them. armed with data concluding that human beings do their most astonishing work when they are fresh and relaxed versus exhausted and stressed, genuine pros dedicated to the glorification of their genius operate in a mode of pulsation, operating more like sprinters than marathoners. the implementation: after you’ve run the // segment of your workday, use a timer and work at your best for sixty minutes straight while sitting or standing quietly, in your tight bubble of total focus. train yourself not to move. just concentrate. and create the highest results you can possibly make. after your sixty-minute productivity sprint is done, refuel for ten minutes. ideas for this recovery cycle include going for a quick walk in fresh air, reading a book that will advance your leadership or personal mastery, meditating, visualizing or listening to energizing music with headphones on like many championship athletes do before they step onto the court, so that their brain’s attention shifts from the ruminating and worrying behaviors of the left hemisphere into the creativity and flow of the right section. after ten wonderful minutes of regeneration, go back and perform your next sixty-minute work segment, full of inspiration, excellence and ingenuity. and then your next ten-minute cycle of renewal. tactic #: the daily concept the insight: studies show that the most effective business leaders are at their productive peak on the days when, even if they’ve faced some serious setbacks, they’ve actively engaged their mindset on the progress they’ve made. in so doing, they’ve inoculated themselves from the self-sabotaging influence of the brain’s negativity bias. one of the great keys to terrific performance, then, is to train your attention on making consistent % wins and micro-achievements throughout each hour of your workday. small daily achievements, when done consistently over time, definitely do lead to stunning results. and by deliberately reflecting on the areas where you are moving ahead, you’ll insulate your ambition, guard your confidence and defeat the dangerous trickster of fear, so you get amazing feats done. the implementation: during the second pocket of your victory hour, list the five tiny targets you wish to accomplish over the day ahead for you to feel it was one well-spent. this, like so much of what you’ve learned, is also a practice: the more you do it, the easier this habit gets—and the stronger your execution ability around it grows. so, stay with the process. after just thirty days, you’ll have accomplished valuable victories. and after a year, this strategy alone will be responsible for you achieving , high-value targets, guaranteeing that the next twelve months are the single most productive twelve months you’ve had yet. tactic #: the nd wind workout (ww) the insight: you’ve now discovered the beautiful neuroscience behind daily exercise. moving the body regularly lifts your concentration, speeds up the processing potency of your brain as well as accelerating its learning capacity, raises your energy, elevates your optimism, helps you sleep better via the production of more melatonin and promotes longevity through the release of human growth hormone (hgh), along with the lengthening of your telomeres. telomeres keep the ends of our chromosomes from fraying—they’re like plastic caps at the tips of shoelaces. aging shortens our telomeres, which is why they are sometimes compared to a bomb fuse. the powerful point here is that it’s well-documented that exercise slows this shortening, helping you stay healthy longer. you should also note that meditation, a diet rich in whole foods, proper sleep quality and intermittent fasting (which the spellbinder calls the / dividend because you don’t eat during a sixteen-hour fasting window and then break the fast over an eight-hour period) have all proven to protect our telomeres from degenerating. given the empirically based facts substantiating the absolutely transformative power of"
sharma,"exercise, why would you do only one workout a day? why not use this regimen to increase your vitality massively so you not only outlive your industry peers but hack aging as you enjoy an astoundingly happy and productive life? the implementation: to execute the ww practice, schedule a second workout at the end of your workday to give you a second wind for a great evening. you’ll beat the exhaustion most people feel after work, re-energize your willpower batteries so you improve your evening choices and even find your cravings for sugar in the nighttime are significantly lower. one of the finest activities you could possibly do at this time is a one-hour nature walk. you’ll gain another block of time free from digital interruption, letting you do more deep thinking and downloading of valuable ideas. you’ll also be rewarded with the benefits that walking within natural surroundings with sunlight and fresh air bring to your mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset. naturalist john muir expressed it well when he said: “in every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.” other ideas for your ww include going for a sixty-minute mountain bike ride, having a long swim or attending a yoga class. in running this routine, you’ll also burn even more calories and speed up your metabolic rate, reducing body fat. the ww is a game-changer. tactic #: the massage protocol (mp) the insight: studies have demonstrated that massage therapy is a modality that generates significant improvements in brain performance, mood, your ability to fight stress, and in terms of your general wellness. the benefits of a massage include a % reduction of cortisol (the fear hormone) levels; a % increase in dopamine (the neurotransmitter of motivation); a % elevation of serotonin (the neurochemical responsible for regulating anxiety and raising happiness); reduced muscle tension; improved pain relief via the sending of anti-inflammation messaging to muscle cells; and elevations in the signaling of those cells to make more mitochondria. the key here is to have a deep-tissue massage versus simple relaxation bodywork. it needs to hurt a little for it to work well. this awesome practice also reduces the stress that causes telomeres to degrade, optimizing your good health and maximizing your lifespan. the implementation: to apply the mp, lock two ninety-minute massages onto your weekly schedule. because the things that get scheduled are the things that get done. and because vague plans yield vague performance. and because the smallest of applications really is better than the grandest of intentions. virtuosos bring traction to their vision through their dedication to implementation. you might say you’re a busy performer and can’t afford the time to get two long massages every single week. in fact, given the proven and marvelous benefits of this protocol for your mental state, cognition, joyfulness, health and longevity, the truth is you can’t afford not to install this habit. yes, two ninety-minute massages a week will cost a lot of money. death will cost you more. tactic #: traffic university the insight: people who commute a total of sixty minutes to and from work each day spend approximately twelve hundred days of their lives doing so—if they live an average human lifetime. that’s over three years spent in traffic or on a bus or in a train. and with the rise of the mega-commute, that time period is only growing. most people sitting bumper to bumper are infecting themselves with toxic news, superficial banter on the radio and other negative stimulation that erodes production and dissolves inner peace. people on commuter trains or buses often sleep, daydream or play with their technology, in a chronic state of apathy. be different. the implementation: participating in traffic university is all about leveraging your traveling time—whether to and from work or grocery shopping and errand running—to learn, expanding your professional prowess and personal knowledge. specific ideas to help you do so include listening to audiobooks and consuming valuable podcasts. the fact is, even one new idea you learn in a book or online course could make you millions or even billions of dollars. or multiply your creativity, productivity, vitality and spirituality exponentially. there is simply no other investment vehicle available today that will yield a higher return than investing in your education and growth. tactic #: the dream team technique the insight: professional athletes structure a full team to support their rise to best in world (biw). in this way, they are freed up to marshal their five assets of genius around the development of the expertise and powers that will cause them to become dominant at their sport. michael jordan wasn’t his own sports doctor and muhammad ali wasn’t his own boxing trainer. superproducers outsource and then automate all activities except those within the realm of their mastery, allowing for purity of focus and freeing up huge amounts of time. the implementation: delegate tasks that not only are a poor use of your hours but also diminish your happiness. ideally, restructure your entire life so you’re doing only the things you’re great at—and love to do. with such a setup, you’ll not only escalate in your performance because you’re prioritized around just a few things, but you’ll enjoy significantly more personal freedom. and serenity. as well, because you have people on your dream team who are leaders at what they do, your rise to legendary will be swifter since you have great people in your corner. specific members of your dream team could include a fitness trainer who you work with regularly, a nutritionist, a massage therapist, a financial coach to fortify your fortune, a relationship adviser to help you maintain rich bonds with the important people in your life and a spiritual counselor to assist you in staying grounded on the eternal laws of a life well-lived. tactic #: the weekly design system (wds) the insight: you now know that things that get scheduled are the things that get done. designing a week without a granulated"

clutching her picture as he said this. “every valentine’s day, it was our tradition for me to present her with one hundred and eight red roses, some terrific chocolates and one other thing over dinner at our favorite restaurant. after that, i’d get down on a knee and recite the poem.” “what was ‘the other thing’?” asked the artist. the billionaire looked a little embarrassed. his gaze fell to the floor of the penthouse. “lingerie,” was his one-word answer, spoken with a wink. he then stood up on the sprawling oak dining table that sat in one section of the gigantic hotel suite. like a child playing hide and go seek, he covered each of his eyes with a hand. next, he recited an old poem by spencer michael free with thunderous passion: ’tis the human touch in this world that counts, the touch of your hand and mine, which means far more to the fainting heart than shelter and bread and wine. for shelter is gone when the night is o’er, and bread lasts only a day. but the touch of the hand and the sound of the voice sing on in the soul always. “that’s so beautiful,” said the artist, visibly moved. it was growing clearer to mr. riley that though this bohemian painter had rough edges, he had a soft heart. and though it might appear to an uninformed onlooker that the artist was the more passive half of the romantic couple, this was, in fact, untrue. the reality was that the depth of his great love for the entrepreneur overrode the immature needs of his ego. all his kindness wasn’t to be confused with weakness. the artist was a powerful man. “i’ve written a poem myself,” the artist added. “it’s for you, my beloved.” “read it to me. please,” said the entrepreneur gracefully as she fixed his collar. “okay,” said the artist with a gulp. “it’s called ‘may we never say goodbye.’ and it goes like this: m ay w e n ever s ay g oodbye a chance encounter and that very first glance, your beauty moved me and your strength calmed me. life’s unexpected windows of opportunity sent by a knowing intelligence asking us to do our part. by taking a risk. only those who dare will win. only those willing to face rejection will find their salvation. only those who reclaim their power will experience a resurrection. i’ve never known true love. i’ve never believed in double rainbows. romantic walks and holding hands at sunrise. i never imagined that first kiss would lead to this. when you fall, i will support you. should you be scared, i will hold you. when you are in doubt, i will stand by you. when you enjoy success, i will raise my glass to you. and when you feel like leaving, i won’t let you go. i think of you constantly. i feel you"
sharma,"deep within me. i’m not sure what i’ve done to deserve you. but my dream now is to grow old with you. may we never say goodbye. the artist went down on one knee and kissed a hand of his soon-to-be bride. she blushed vividly and was profoundly touched. one could then hear loud crying. the two students handed their mentor a tissue, so he could dry his eyes. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club embraces the twin cycles of elite performance “with freedom, books, flowers, and the moon, who could not be happy?” —oscar wilde the billionaire was seated alone on the spacious terrace of the private cottage he had rented on a wine estate in franschhoek, south africa. as he wrote his daily diaries, mr. riley reflected on the marvelous happiness, uncommon exuberance and striking beauty that was present at the wedding of the entrepreneur and the artist in s ão paulo. they were clearly meant for each other. “the universe works in interesting and absolutely intelligent ways,” he thought. “and if there was a union that would go the distance, it would be this one.” as the magnate made notes in his journal, birds sang their carefree songs and gardeners in blue work uniforms dug into the soil of the vineyard with shiny shovels while speaking energetically in thick south african accents. the tangled yet lovingly arranged vines on wooden stakes spoke of an enchantment that nature alone affords while a mystical wisp of fog slowly migrated from franschhoek valley up toward the surrounding mountains. a little earlier, at am , the billionaire had taken the entrepreneur and the artist on a mountain bike ride that began on the wine farm, then meandered down daniel hugo street and into the village—past well-used horse stables, lazy dogs that moved as slow as snails on prozac and rose bushes that had twisted along the white picket fences that had been erected along both sides of the rough dirt road. it really was a near-perfect little place the billionaire had selected as the setting for his second-to-last mentoring session. the lesson that the billionaire had presented as the three of them rode together centered on the vital importance of balancing elite personal performance with deep self-renewal for sustained masterful achievement. the titan explained the value of alternating time in the world pursuing success at the highest level with time in the wilderness recovering—a symmetry needed to ensure a strong harmony between winning at work and richness in life. and to guarantee that his students played the long game around their assets of genius, the billionaire also explained that massive productivity in society without an abundant heart, an authentic sense of joyfulness and enduring inner peace was no different from the game a hamster plays on a running wheel. it thinks it’s moving, yet it remains in a cage. as the early morning rays melted into the lush greenery, the mogul pedaled his shiny red bicycle, talked excitedly and laughed festive, optimistic, truthful laughs. the kind of laughs we all long to experience more of in our lives. he also continued to cough a lot. one time he even spat up some blood. yet, because the billionaire seemed vibrant and unusually healthy, the entrepreneur and the artist remained only somewhat concerned for their generous mentor’s well-being. perhaps this was their mistake. but the newlyweds were so in the moment that they didn’t spend much time trying to figure out what was going on. in retrospect, they would wish they had. when the three companions took a break from riding, stone riley presented the husband and wife with another learning model, which he pulled out of a blue backpack. it looked like this: the billionaire taught that “exceedingly excellent creative production without calibrated human asset protection leads to a noticeable performance reduction.” what he meant by that was this: becoming legendary in your industry is all about sustainability . and making sure you show up at world-class not just for a month or even for an entire year. the real sport of the captains of commerce, the great masters of the arts, the visionaries of the sciences, the heroes of the humanities and the giants of athletics is preserving your a-game over a lifetime . “longevity really is a key to legendary,” he reinforced. “this,” he told his two appreciative students, “is one of the main keys to your rise to iconic. you really must learn how to balance working intensely and brilliantly with deep rest and recovery so you can remain fresh and strong over a long career. as you do this, you won’t blow out your gifts by hyperextending them, in the same way that some pro athletes blow out their knees—preventing them from ever playing again. the geniuses all know and apply this remarkably important principle.” as the billionaire sipped sweet, dark coffee, he explained that what makes the great men and women of the world exceptional, in part, is their implementation of a phenomenon known as “supercompensation.” just as a muscle tears when you stress it to the edge of its capacity and then actually grows during the pause of recovery , your five assets of genius surge when you actively push them past their usual limits and then allow for a period of regeneration. mr. riley pointed to the framework on the paper and said, “see, cats, the little-known key to terrific success over the long term lies in a simple word: oscillation . i mentioned it in são paulo, but you’re both ready to go deeper.” “we definitely are,” declared the entrepreneur. “get this,” the billionaire said. “when scientists studied the great russian weightlifters, they discovered that the secret behind their undefeatability was their work-rest ratios.” “what does that mean?” asked the artist as the companions walked their mountain bikes along a trail at the edge of a fabulous vineyard. “your growth happens when you’re resting,” replied the billionaire in a straightforward way. “makes no logical"
sharma,"sense, right?” the billionaire went on. “in fact, this productivity rule is one of the most central yet paradoxical truths the spellbinder revealed to me as i was building my global empires. the mainstream thinking tells us that to get more done, we must put in more hours. to achieve more, we need to do more. but solid research now confirms that that kind of linear approach—‘work harder to produce better’—is seriously flawed. it isn’t sustainable. it just leads to burnout. exhaustion. loss of inspiration and the reduction of your private fire to lead the field—and enhance our world. that old-school way of operating also causes a visceral depletion of the very human resources which, if applied intelligently, will make you the master of your marketplace.” “what you’re sharing reminds me of the / method ,” remarked the artist happily. he was dressed in the riding gear the billionaire had provided. and, given his now daily practice of the // formula as a member in good standing of the am club, he looked significantly fitter, more focused, more energetic and more self-confident than when he showed up at the spellbinder’s conference. his transformation was quite marvelous. “superb point,” applauded the billionaire. “and you’re right. yet the learning model i’m about to walk you through is so much more than that. today you’ll receive advanced insight on how to alternate work-rest periods to generate exponential productivity. you’ll also learn how to have a blast while you’re doing it. this morning you’ll discover how to work less yet materialize more through what pro athletes call ‘periodization.’ after we’re done, you both will be well beyond any superficial understanding of what it takes to triumph in your sphere while living beautifully for the rest of your life.” the billionaire pointed to the part of the learning framework entitled the assets of genius. “as you’ve now learned, every morning you wake up with a full battery of creative power. each dawn you awaken to a full well of five private treasures that, if properly managed, will cause you to overcome the violence of your excuses and avoid the knife blade of your past limits so that the great hero encoded within your soul meets the light of day. and enable you to become all you’re meant to be. as a maker of spectacular work, as a leader without a title and as a human being dedicated to living in awe of life’s most gorgeous graces.” “i’m all in!” exclaimed the artist. “and as you now know, the assets of genius ,” continued mr. riley as he looked at the diagram, “are your mental focus, your physical energy, your personal willpower, your original talent and your daily time. i repeat this so you’ll remember this. these primary assets are at their highest early in the morning. that’s why you want to start your day well and perform your most important pursuits during your most valuable hours instead of wasting this precious opportunity fooling around with your technology, watching the news or oversleeping.” “got you,” confirmed the entrepreneur, ferociously taking notes in the leather journal she received in rome. a colorful scarf with elegant patterns on it gave her ponytail a dramatic look this particular morning. “and the essential point of today’s lesson is this,” the billionaire spoke as he pointed to the center of the model. “top performance truly isn’t a linear game. elite accomplishment is much more like a heartbeat, more like a rhythm, more like a pulse. if you want to show up as a great master—over decades so you literally dominate your domain for an entire career and lead a life you love well into old age—you absolutely need to alternate high excellence cycles, those periods of intense and fantastic output, with times of meaningful recovery, deep refueling cycles. please study this,” the billionaire requested, tapping an index finger on the printed framework. “just so i’m clear,” said the artist, as he inhaled the fresh air, “hec is our high excellence cycle and drc is our deep refueling cycle?” “yes,” replied the billionaire. today his black t-shirt had white lettering on it that read, “yes, i’m in a relationship—with myself.” his weirdness was magnificent. “and so, your main move if you want enduring victory—professionally as well as personally—is to oscillate,” the tycoon carried on. “to cycle periods of passionate, monomaniacally focused and potent work at the highest grade with blocks of time set for refueling, relaxing, recovering and pure fun. it really is like your heartbeat, pulsing.” “i so love this concept you’re so kindly teaching us,” noted the entrepreneur. “this will be another needle-mover for my business life and for my private world.” “yes, it will be,” agreed the billionaire succinctly. “growth does happen in the resting phase. that’s counterintuitive. right? we’ve been programmed to think that if we’re not creating and producing, we’re wasting our time. we feel guilty if we’re not doing. but look at this.” the baron unzipped a nylon carrying case that had been fastened around his waist. he pulled out two medals that appeared to be made of gold and placed them around the necks of the entrepreneur and the artist, as one would do in celebration of a champion. on each medal, these words were engraved: t he l egendary p erformance e quation: p ressure × r efueling = g rowth + e ndurance “tennis great billie jean king said that pressure is a privilege,” the billionaire reminded his two students. “see, pressure and stress aren’t bad.” “they’re not?” questioned the entrepreneur. “nope. they’re actually absolutely necessary for the expansion of your capacity,” voiced the billionaire. “you must push your talents hard,” the billionaire continued. “even when you don’t want to. past your comfort zone. only then will they grow. always remember this: the time you least feel like doing something is the best time to do it . and part of the reason for this, as you also now know, is because when"
sharma,"you enlarge your willpower muscle in one important area, your self-discipline in every other area rises with you. the larger point i’m trying to make here is that pressure and stress are wonderful blessings that a-players exploit. our gifts don’t increase when we stay in our safety circles. nope. challenge and stretch your capacities past the normal. muscles expand only when we take them past our usual limits. and then allow for some time to refuel and recover.” the billionaire surveyed the vineyard. then he added, “i recall having a fascinating conversation with a pro athlete who showed up at one of my charity dinners. you know what he told me?” “what?” wondered the artist. “‘i rest to allow all my training to take effect,’” pronounced the billionaire. “profound way of seeing things. all work and no break depletes your greatness, over time.” “hmm,” murmured the entrepreneur, rolling her mountain bike over to a stake and leaning the seat against it. “if you want to build stronger abdominal muscles you stress them past their current boundaries,” said the billionaire. “if you usually do a hundred sit-ups, you do two hundred. if two hundred is your daily quota, go up to three hundred. this actually causes the muscle to rip apart. the exercise physiologists call the phenomenon ‘micro-tearing.’ yet, if you want the muscle to grow, you can’t keep exercising it relentlessly or you’ll experience injury. you need to rest the muscles for a day or two.” “and it’s in that recovery cycle when the actual growth happens,” interjected the artist, locking in on the principle he was learning. “absolutely correct!” enthused the billionaire. “growth happens in the resting phase—not in the performing stage. recall early on in our work together on my beach in mauritius i told you cats i grew up on a farm, long before i moved to malibu?” “think so,” spoke the entrepreneur. “mauritius feels like another lifetime ago.” “well, there’s a metaphor that i learned at our farm that will help you fully understand the twin cycles of elite performance . talk to any farmer and she’ll tell you about the ‘fallow season.’ before it, there’s an intense period when the soil gets tilled, crops get planted and serious work gets done. then there’s that season of resting. seems like nothing’s happening. looks like time is a wasting. yet here’s the neat part: it’s in the fallow season that the harvest is really blossoming. all the produce that shows during autumn is just the visible end result.” the billionaire slurped some more coffee. he spilled a little on his t-shirt. the container that held the java had “dream big. start small. begin now” written on it. a yellow butterfly with tender flapping wings that had blood-red veins along them glided by. three eagles announced their authority overhead. “god, i love butterflies,” the billionaire said wistfully. “and rainbows, shooting stars, full moons and glorious sunsets. why be alive if you’re not going to be totally alive ? “i was like a robot when i was in my twenties,” he admitted. “i took myself too seriously. didn’t have a minute to waste. every hour was scheduled. every car ride had to have an audiobook running. all flight time was about productivity. here’s the thing …” his voice trailed off as his eyes appeared lonely, melancholic and lost. “i was exhausted a lot of the time. the spellbinder saved my life. he really did. and the model i’m walking you through this morning helped immensely.” the billionaire took a deep breath, then went on. “my assets of genius became eroded over time. my creativity was floundering—as was my effectiveness. i’ve since realized that i’m paid by my group of companies to think. to come up with visions and ideas for new products and innovations that will shatter the compass and deliver humongous value to all our clients around the world. but i didn’t understand that back then. the spellbinder assisted me enormously. taught me the twin cycles of elite performance during our very first coaching session. and insisted relentlessly that i implement them instantly—and consistently. but boy, did i fight him on this one! it was just so against my nature to relax and breathe and to pause. now i totally get that rest is the very thing that enables our primal greatness to unfold.” the entrepreneur nodded her head in understanding. “if i’m not working, i feel super-guilty. like i’m doing something wrong.” “self-care is essential to self-love,” remarked the billionaire. “all i’m saying is i now understand that balance is vastly important to world-class performance. working day and night didn’t make me more efficient at all. it just made me more tired. and cranky. so, now i make the time to rest, to nourish myself, to mountain bike, to read the books i’ve always wanted to read, to enjoy a glass of excellent wine like the glass of amazing pinotage i savored last night in front of the blazing fire in my cottage here in the valley. ironically, as i've practiced this kind of recovery, my creativity has multiplied, my productivity has soared and my results have skyrocketed. it’s just so profound: i work less, have more fun and yet i get way more done .” mr. riley then reached into his blue backpack and pulled out a piece of white material, which looked like it came from the sail of a schooner. remarkably, you could see a drawing of albert einstein in a sailboat on it. if you were there, in that precious vineyard with them, you would have seen this: mae besom the industrialist continued his discourse, out in that delightful vineyard. “oh yes, cool cats, having fun is so very essential to leading your field, upgrading your life and inspiring the world. all of the amazing creatives and productive icons of history had one thing in common, you know?” “tell us—please,” requested the entrepreneur as her bangles made a “clink-clink” sound. her new wedding"
sharma,"ring shimmered in the morning sunlight. the billionaire flipped into a quick handstand. he then beat his chest fast with a single fist as he whispered these words to himself: this day is priceless. all the money in the world will not bring it back again. and so, i seize it and i savor it and i honor it. this day, i fill my mind with big dreams so there is no space for petty doubts. i replace the psychology of can’t with the mentality of can. and i remember that my greatest growth lies at the jagged edges of my highest limits. this day, i’ll recall that until my mission becomes my obsession, my gifts will never become my glory. and until my hunger to serve transcends the insecurities of my self, i’ll miss the grand chance of these precious hours to be a vehicle for helpfulness. this day, i reload my devotion to avoid a counterfeit nobility, staying sincere, humble—with both feet on this sacred ground. should naysayers and bad actors throw rocks at me, i reply with kindness and love in the face of their bad behavior—even if they don’t deserve it. should critics make fun of me—as they always have since i was a kid—i’ll take the rocks they throw at me and make them into monuments of mastery. and should anyone call me strange, as they often do, i’ll smile with the blatant wisdom stuck deep in my heart that it’s only misfits, oddballs and eccentrics that change our world. being different is really cool. and eccentricity is very hip. it was quite a sensational scene. stone riley, upside down, beating his chest as if to activate his heart and reciting his poetry. “words are creative, you know,” he articulated as he stood up and inhaled a big gulp of fresh franschhoek air. “speak the words of unchained heroism. talk the preach of a passionate possibilitarian. use the languaging of hope, the sentencing of power and the phrasing of leadership—and unbridled love. i manage my words meticulously. every morning.” the billionaire looked at the vines. “anyhoo,” he added, “all great geniuses really loved to play. they understood that having fun is a potent form of recovery. they all had leisure activities that recharged their empty batteries. einstein loved to sail. aristotle and charles dickens adored daily walks. hollywood superstar meryl streep used to knit, steve wozniak played polo, bill gates mastered bridge and sergey brin would often be up on a high-flying trapeze. time away from work isn’t a waste,” the tycoon reinforced. “it’s a must. offers a space for incubation of the very ideas that will make you a fortune. so work less to get more done. that’s pretty much what the twin cycles of elite performance model is all about.” “i’m understanding the / method ’s value even more,” the artist contributed. “i guess this also means it’s okay to have a few days off every week.” “not only okay but necessary to guard your five assets of genius, the very ones that a-players leverage to realize industry prominence so their work stands the test of time. to be specific and tactical: take at least two full days off each week . no technology. ‘zero device days’ is what the spellbinder calls them. full recovery. and every quarter, take off even more time. for decades i’ve taken june, july and august to vacation. i sail, bike, sleep, read, swim, chill with my friends, have the happiest times with my daughter and experience life at its best. you cats may not be able to take this much time off. but i need to tell you that during these renewal cycles i do my best thinking and planning and get my best insights. i always return to the office a thousand times more inspired, on fire and alive.” another butterfly floated by. the vineyard seemed to whisper of wonderful miracles to come. though the sun now stood in its full radiant glory, a thin slip of a moon competed for attention in the big african sky. it was breathtaking. the entrepreneur grasped her husband’s hand. “this is magical,” she said. “you know, guys,” mr. riley said as he picked up his bike and started walking along the secret back road that he had somehow discovered. “heaven on earth isn’t some mystical, spiritual place to aspire to. it’s not some realm reserved only for saints, seers and sages. not at all. i’ve discovered—and boy, have i led a colorful, intense life all these years—that heaven on earth is a state, that anyone can create.” the billionaire was now deepening the conversation significantly and growing even more philosophical around this particular lesson on work-life boundaries for sustained legendary performance—and a happier existence. because business victory without a joyful heart misses the opportunity. “i feel really, really blessed in my life,” stone riley stated. “i live mostly in the magic.” “the magic?” wondered the artist, now pulling on two dreadlocks and unlacing his biking shoes. “the magic,” confirmed the billionaire, looking serene yet confident, relaxed yet thoughtful, playful yet spiritual. “i’ve learned that being successful without feeling soulful is the highest of defeats.” the entrepreneur and the artist sat down next to each other on the soil of the vineyard. the billionaire kept on. “while i’ve always been passionate about advancing my companies and expanding my commercial interests— mostly to see how far i can go and to help me fuel my philanthropic work—i am equally dedicated to savoring the magic of a life astoundingly well-lived. winning without enjoying is nothing.” “not so sure i get you,” admitted the entrepreneur as a truck carrying a gaggle of workers with charismatic smiles sailed by. “it’s a great morning!” one shouted. “i love my work, so much. and i do get a lot of pleasure from the homes, the goods and the toys i own. but i need none of it. i have my things and my public reputation as"
sharma,"a global businessperson. yet i don’t identify with it. i’m not attached to any of this. as i grow older, i still love the pleasures of this world very much—but i don’t require them for my happiness and peacefulness. i’ve come to see it all as a big game, a sport of sorts. “i own my things, but they don’t own me,” the baron continued. “and though i play in the world i also adore the wilderness, not only metaphorically but literally—like here experiencing the natural wonders of this ethereal valley in franschhoek. this, too, is how i live the twin cycles model. i make time to enjoy life completely.” “the magic,” repeated the billionaire as singing birds seemed to croon louder and a flutter of even more butterflies showed up to listen in on the conversation. “god, life is beautiful. don’t miss out on all of its awesomeness and incredibleness. it’s there for you—no matter what you might be going through. see, we all live on borrowed time. and life does whiz by so quickly. you two cats will be old before you know it, probably hanging out with a hundred grandchildren,” he said with a chuckle. “anyhoo,” mr. riley spoke in a whisper. “utopia, shangri-la, nirvana and heaven on earth are just names for a state of being, not a place of visiting. you enter the magic of life and begin to experience outright bliss daily once you reclaim the inherent power that lurks in your core. and when you don’t postpone being grateful for even the tiniest of everyday graces. you’ll become a magnet for miracles when you begin being a magician of sorts.” “the billionaire’s getting into some pretty mystical and far out territory now,” thought the entrepreneur. “heaven on earth,” recited the industrialist. “my life is generally a steady stream of beauty, you know? and i’ve discovered this has little to do with having a lot of money. it has more to do with finding fulfillment, in the smallest of things. the way the fire warmed me and inspired me last evening, for example. it has to do with spending a lot of time in nature, whether that’s in vineyards like these,” he said, pointing an index finger across the wine farms that filled the valley, “or on walks in a forest, or hiking in the mountains, or being near the sea, or drifting through the sands of a barren desert. it has to do with reconnecting to the awe, wonder and majesty that every human life has available to it by visiting art galleries frequently and letting the energy and genius of the creators infuse your mindset, heartset, healthset and soulset. it has to do with eating fresh food, simply prepared, with interesting, real, thoughtful, creative and compassionate people who make you feel good. stepping into the magic also has a lot to do with saying goodbye to your past, embracing the present and making a return to the imaginativeness, innocence, exuberance and lovingness you were intimate with when you were a child. adults are deteriorated children. heaven on earth shows up naturally in your heart when you have the brilliance and bravery to start opening it up again. like you did when you were little.” “picasso once said, ‘it took me four years to paint like raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child,’” contributed the artist energetically. “i’d agree that getting back to being more innocent brings the magic back to our lives.” the billionaire stopped. he rested his bike and waved for his two students to follow him over to an area of the vineyard that had a black metal sign marked “chenin blanc” in bright yellow letters. stone riley then fell to his knees. the entrepreneur and the artist watched him draw a learning model in the mineral-rich soil of the terroir. it looked exactly like this: lola landekic “the magic,” the billionaire mused, still whispering, as he stood up straight as a soldier. his eyes were closed now. his thick hair fluttered slightly in the mild wind. as he placed one hand to his heart, more doves materialized. “i’m really into breezes these days. you’d only appreciate them if you didn’t have them anymore. like i’m saying, there’s such an enchantment to life. it’s right in front of you. available to anyone. we all can become magicians of sorts. but to experience this higher reality i’m speaking of—to really find it—you’ll need to leave the world a lot. play in common society and succeed in the game it sells you but disconnect from it often, so you’re never really owned by it. because the sport the majority is playing is only an illusion—sort of a waking dream—that too many good people are donating the best mornings of their finest days to as they put money over meaning, profits over people, popularity over integrity, being busy over family and achievement over loving the basic miracles of the now.” the billionaire’s eyes remained closed. next, he lifted both hands toward the heavens, as he liked to do. “you enter the magic by using your joy as a gps,” disclosed the billionaire, speaking directly to the diagram he’d drawn in the dirt. “to know ever-increasing amounts of happiness, trust what makes you feel happy. your heart knows where you need to be. it’s so much wiser than your head. instinct knows so much more than intellect and intuition is smarter than reason, that’s for sure. our intelligence is made up of what those around us have taught us. it’s limited. it’s confined by logic—and what’s been done before. your sovereign self knows better. it operates in possibility, not practicality. it’s visionary. it’s unlimited .” “not sure i understand you,” said the entrepreneur. “follow your joy,” instructed mr. riley. “only be around those people who fuel your joy. only perform those pursuits that feed your bliss. only be in those places that make you feel most alive. look, i know it’s hard"
sharma,"to live this model perfectly. so please see this framework as an ideal to move toward. and like everything else i’ve taught you, it’s a process—not an event. it’ll take time. but it begins with being aware of this model. and then allowing your joy to be your gps.” the billionaire started walking with his mountain bike and gently motioned for his two students to follow. “ah, the magic that lives at the essence of life. love it so much. fills me with more serenity and tranquility than any material object ever has. and this is the importance of balancing being successful with being soulful.” the billionaire clenched his arms tightly and looked as if he was dealing with severe pain, yet again. “your heart is always wiser than your head,” he repeated softly. “it knows where you must be. follow it. trust it. you’ll find the magic.” the billionaire gave a signal and instantly, from behind a scarecrow, an assistant dashed across the vineyard to his employer. a silver spade was handed to the billionaire, and a quick hug was exchanged. the magnate began to dig with gusto. soon a clack could be heard as metal struck metal. mr. riley knelt to the ground and began wiping soil from a steel box that had been embedded into the earth. as he did this he started yodeling, much as folk singers in switzerland and austria do. it was something else to watch the industrialist as he dug. and to hear him sing. the entrepreneur and the artist were mesmerized. the box was then opened, with colossal care. inside were eleven magic charms, each attached to a letter. in that moment, sunshine radiating over the billionaire created the effect of another shimmering halo. “i am part of all that is,” mumbled the billionaire to himself. “the great power of the universe is within me. all i desire, with active faith, positivity, expectancy and purposeful conviction, is on its way to me. and if that which i wish for does not come, it’s simply because something even better is on its way. i know this belief to be true. all wizards know it to be true.” the entrepreneur and the artist stared at each other, eyes wide open. “what are you doing?” quizzed the artist. “i’m using one of my incantations,” responded the billionaire. he added more yodeling to the end of his sentence, then said, “you can’t produce magic in your life until you learn the luminous arts of a real magician.” abruptly, the box began to rise and hover over the soil for just a moment. the mouths of the entrepreneur and the artist were now as open as a rose in springtime. the artist was a little unnerved. “optical illusion someone taught you, right?” “maybe yes. maybe no.” mr. riley’s reply only heightened the mystery. “each of these magic charms will help you remember one of the eleven maxims i’ve been applying over these past decades for increasing my financial fortune and for experiencing an exquisite life. like i said, my days provide a steady stream of beauty, grand awe and relentless wonder. heaven on earth,” the billionaire reiterated. “and i want you both to live like this, too. the cool thing is that anyone can create this kind of an existence. but very few people alive today know how to manifest one. “and each associated letter will bring together some of the key themes i’ve shared with you on this sensational adventure, sort of to summarize things as we approach the end,” the mogul added. the first charm was a small mirror. here’s what the letter attached to it said: the billionaire’s maxim # to create magic in the world, own the magic within yourself. look in the mirror. your relationship with you predicts your relationship with the world. remember that you have a primitive longing for silence and solitude—and that it is in quietude that self-awareness rises. french mathematician blaise pascal wrote: “all of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” release your need for complexity and immerse yourself in the stillness only the early morning can provide so you get to know yourself again. because a flight from solitude really is an escape from freedom. to become an everyday magician, so your life is rich with passion, plenty and peace, grow more comfortable being still. so you start to hear the whispers of the great genius who slumbers within you. in restfulness, you’ll remember all you truly are. you’ll reaccess that supreme self, abundant with creativity, potency, invincibility and a love that has no conditions. in this sanctuary of silence, you will also be afforded something so rare in this age: time for yourself to be . and the more you do so, the more you’ll discover how life really works. you’ll also begin to differentiate between your beliefs that are merely cultural constraints and those that are actual truths. and between the trustworthy voice of your intuition and the persuasive pronouncements of your fears. in solitude, you’ll also receive the disruptive insights that will transform your field. i know it sounds strange but amid serenity, you’ll actually visit the alternate reality in which visionaries like nikola tesla, albert einstein, grace hopper, thomas edison, john d. rockefeller, marie curie, andrew carnegie, katharine graham, sam walton, rosalind franklin, and steve jobs, among other luminaries, spent much time. why do you think the legendary scientists, inventors, industrialists and artists all made so much effort to be alone? i’ve shared with you that long stretches spent in noiseless contemplation is one of the secrets of the advanced mind. ultimately, you’re the only person you’ll be with your entire life. why not strengthen your relationship with your greatest self, fully know your genius and start a lifetime love affair with your most noble nature? the second magic charm was in the form of a flower. the billionaire relished its fragrance. he then smiled and"
sharma,"passed the letter associated with it to his students for their review. it read: the billionaire’s maxim # collect miraculous experiences over material things. the world has burdened and hardened you. as a child, your instinct showed you how to spot the miraculousness of a snowflake, find fortune in a spider’s web and adore the splendor of falling leaves on a colorful autumn morning. the pursuit wasn’t about acquiring things. it was about exploring life. to switch the lens through which you see life from one that views what’s ordinary to one that perceives the extraordinary is to multiply your ability to create miracles. and to re-engage with the lost purity you knew in your youth before a broken society trained you to value objects and cash over joys and delights. laugh more often, dance more regularly and play more frequently. please. “the future holds promises of mysterious good. anything can happen overnight,” said the mystic florence scovel shinn. be more alive to the wonders that inhabit your days: gentle breezes, squirrels chasing each other in a park and music that is so wonderful it makes you cry. and you will begin to live as royalty along with heightening your primal powers to produce even more magic in your mornings. never sacrifice your well-being and quality of life for greater annual income or larger net worth. the determinants of a magnificent life have remained the same for centuries: a sense that you’re growing and capitalizing on your human potential; effortful work that draws out your finest productivity and is profitable for humanity; weighty connections with positive people who escalate your jubilation; and time doing that which nurtures your spirit as you advance through your days with a grateful heart. yes, in rome i licked my journal. it’s one of the rituals i run to actively heighten my aliveness by raising my appreciation of all the good blessings that have been given to me. the more vividly i value everything in my life, the more everything in my life climbs in value. so, become a collector of awesome experiences instead of a consumer of material things. simplify your life and make a return to the essential enjoyments that are sitting right under your noses. as you do, you will overcome the forces that have suppressed your fire and tear down the charade of superficiality that so many fine souls among us are stuck in. and as you continue, you will come to know how gorgeous and terrific your life really is. and please do remember that your past is a servant that has made you all you now are—not a companion to spend much time with in your present or a friend to carry into your spotless future. it’s impossible to enter the magic that each fresh morning brings if parts of you are holding on to old disappointments, resentments and hurts. you know that well now. lightheartness of being and ancient pain can’t stand the sight of each other. so, train yourself through steady and ceaseless practice to immerse yourself fully in this moment. yes, it takes work and patience. yet savoring this very instant is an essential move for a dazzling life. this time is all you really have. and it’s an empire worth more than any amount of money in the world. one day, you’ll see. the third magic charm was a symbol of a door. “every ending marks a new beginning. all we experience happens for a helpful reason. and when one door closes, another will always open for you,” noted the billionaire. “trust—always—that life has your back—even if what’s unfolding makes no sense.” the attached letter read: the billionaire’s maxim # failure inflates fearlessness. “it is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default,” said j.k. rowling. the mighty goliaths of ambition and the massive behemoth of imagination within you must never be abducted by the tiny cowards of “what would people think?” “what if i get rejected?” and “i’ll probably look silly if i try this.” you can allow yourself to become paralyzed by a fear of rejection or you can go out there and astonish the world. but you just don’t get to do both. life’s reality is that you have a transcendent destiny that begs for your attention in this era of crushing complexity. stop abusing your greatness, deforming your magnificence and denying your radiance by labeling something that didn’t turn out as you wanted a failure. we all know that within every seeming setback lies a distinguished opportunity for even greater success. and start saying yes more often in your life. courage is an exquisite weapon to defeat the armies of regret that tear away at lives meekly lived. a wooden paintbrush about the size of a finger was the next magic charm that mr. riley carefully lifted from the metal box. “this will reinforce the notion that you are a powerful creator of your life. and a mighty artist around your ambitions. that productive, prosperous, fit and optimistic people got their great fortune by luck is a lie. i’ve invested a lot of time making sure you understand this point. that such folks made their empires of money, vitality and influence on society because the stars aligned in the right order to breed their success is pure myth. here, look at this, please,” instructed the mentor kindly as he handed over the next letter. the billionaire’s maxim # proper use of your primal power creates your personal utopia. many human beings spend their finest hours in a facade of satisfaction. by this i mean they think and say they are happy, but in reality they are miserable. they rationalize the fact they have betrayed their dreams, neglected their human treasures and minimized the impact they could have on the planet by telling themselves to be satisfied with what they have, instead"
sharma,"of evolving into more. yes, be wildly thankful for all you have. yet, also consider that such individuals have dead-ended themselves through absolute neglect and outright abandonment of their inherent power. and as a result, all sense of personal freedom and any hope of sovereignty over their lavish talents have been savaged. to enter the magic of your life, you must become aware of the four creative tools that turn each of your desires into your visible results. these four resources that will allow you to materialize miracles in the world are your thoughts, your feelings, your words and your deeds. exercise your mind to think only thoughts that serve your ascent to mastery and happiness. sit regularly in feelings of gratitude, positive expectancy and love for all that you have in your life. speak only the words of upliftment, abundance and encouragement as you saw me doing when i was upside down. and do only those acts that are in forceful alignment with the resident hero that sits at your most wise foundation. study someone playing small with their potential and you will understand clearly why their conditions are as difficult as they are. they focus their thinking on their lack instead of plenty. they disrespect the potency of the word by speaking continually of “problems”; by labeling their circumstances as “terrible”; and by classifying rewards such as vast success, financial wealth, contentment and energetic service to others as “impossible,” failing to understand that it is their own speech that disconnects them from their capacity to craft magic. words truly are creative multipliers. and in terms of the daily deeds of such stuck performers, they don’t work hard at all, doing as little as possible while hoping for a beautiful life, believing no one sees this crime against their humanity. yet the most-high magician within them—their conscience and their subconscious mind—watches it all. and witnesses this theft from their best. the next object was a nazar , an eye-like amulet that some cultures use to ward off evil people. you may have seen one, on one of your travels. “look, cats, i don’t believe anyone is truly evil,” the billionaire said to his students. “well, maybe a few. but mostly, the more i live, the more i know that every one of us has experienced various degrees of trauma in their lives. and as i shared earlier, only people in pain do painful things to others. those who are suffering create suffering. and individuals whose behavior is confusing are generally very confused themselves. they’re just really hurting. and something has happened to them that has caused them to feel threatened. and so the goodness at their core has contracted and closed. to call them horrible people is a superficial judgement. it’s a lot deeper than that quick perception. anyhoo, having said that, for now, let’s just say that for your own maximum productivity, top performance, boundless joyfulness and peace of mind, it’s really important to avoid ‘bad people,’ those who are filled with wounds from the past that they don’t have the self-awareness not to project onto you. i was once on a business trip in barbados, where a taxi driver gave me this piece of wisdom, which has served me very well. ‘avoid bad people.’” the eye had this letter stuck to it: the billionaire’s maxim # avoid bad people. never underestimate the power of your associations. by the phenomenon known as “emotional contagion” as well as through the activation of the mirror neurons in our brains, we model the behavior of the people we spend our days with. fill your life with exceptionally excellent, enterprising, healthy, positive, ethical and sincerely loving people. and over time, you’ll exemplify these lofty traits. allow dream stealers, energy thieves and enthusiasm bandits into your tight bubble of total focus and please know you’re sure to become like them. the real key is to avoid trouble creators. people who have grown up in an environment riddled with drama and non-stop problems will consciously and subconsciously re-create drama and nonstop problems because, as amazing as it seems, such conditions feel familiar, safe and like home to them. stay away from all drama queens and negativity kings. if you don’t, sooner or later, they’ll dissolve your bigness and destroy your life. it’s just what they do. relate peacefully, as much as possible, with everyone. even one enemy is an enemy too many. pass through life gracefully, taking the high road when conflict shows up. should someone do you wrong, let karma do the dirty work. and let a world-class life be your revenge. clipped to the sixth letter in the metal safe box was paper money of a large denomination. it had been folded into a triangle, for some cryptic reason unknown to the entrepreneur and the artist. this letter was longer than the others. it said: the billionaire’s maxim # money is the fruit of generosity, not scarcity. be not misled by the dominant philosophy of the world. poverty is the consequence of an inner condition, not an outer situation. to believe otherwise is to hand over your capacity to produce the magic of the prosperity that you want to the very things you are complaining of. money is a currency that must flow like electricity. yes, cash is a current. it needs to circulate. hoarding it stops the flow of it into your business and private life. all genuine magicians know this. so give more to receive more. leave lavish tips for servers in restaurants, housekeepers in hotels and drivers in taxicabs. donate to charities. do wonderful things for your family and friends without a single thought of any return. a tsunami of abundance will be sent to you. you may wonder why so many of us live in such scarcity. this state of being is due to our money scars. these are the programs hidden deep within our subconscious that were placed there, unknowingly, by the messaging from our parents and"
sharma,"the teaching of other powerful childhood influencers. their common statements, based on the falsehoods that were taught to them, sound like “be happy with what you have” or “rich people are dishonest” or “money doesn’t grow on trees.” these words planted the dark seeds of lack within us at a tender, impressionable age. four practices have helped me make my financial fortune, and so i gift them to you: positive expectancy, active faith, ever-increasing gratitude and extreme value delivery. by positive expectancy i simply mean to tell you that i always maintain a mindset where i expect money will come to me regularly and from highly unexpected sources. active faith is when you behave in a way that shows life you trust it in its abundance and benevolence. the universe adores gestures of affluence like paying for a dinner you had with your friends at an expensive restaurant when you cannot totally afford to do so. or buying the tools you need to raise your craft when there’s little cash in your wallet. i’m in no way suggesting that you throw yourself into a prison of debt. not at all. overleverage is such a destructive force in our civilization today. just show nature you know prosperity is coming and perform acts that make you feel like you have plenty. ever-increasing gratitude, well, we’ve discussed that one a lot over our journey together. continue opening your heart to everything and everyone in your life. bless your money when you pay a bill. bless the cashier at the grocery store and the farmers who harvested your food. bless the motorist who lets you into a line in traffic and the musicians who write the songs that become the soundtrack of your life. bless your legs for carrying you all these years, your eyes for allowing you to witness beauty and your heart for allowing you to feel alive. and extreme value delivery just means giving others—teammates, customers, family members and strangers—exponentially more benefit than they ever could expect from you. because we reap what we sow. developing and then armor-plating your prosperity consciousness will realize quantum gains in your income and personal net worth. so, please get this piece right. much of the sadness in our culture is because too many of us don’t have enough money. this need not be so. “what’s next?” wondered the artist as he pulled a robust grape off a vine and swallowed it whole. the billionaire pulled a miniature running shoe from the case saying, “exercise is definitely a magic charm. read the letter i wrote for you both that goes with it.” the letter said: the billionaire’s maxim # optimal health maximizes your power to produce magic. exercising first thing in the morning gets the primary win of taking care of your health out of the way. this all-important activity is now done, leaving your cognition, energy, physiology and spirit primed to create wonders within your day. when you begin to work out each morning consistently, you’ll be surprised by how poorly you feel when you miss a day. you’ll realize that this is how you felt most of the time before you embraced this habit. you just weren’t aware of it because feeling low was your usual state of being. peak health really is true wealth. those who lose their good health spend the rest of their lives trying to recover it. uncommon vitality is also a marvelous method to grow your prosperity. when you get into the finest fitness of your life, calibrate your nutrition to mastery-level, dial-in your sleep routine and minimize aging, you’ll notice vast increases in your ability to build intimacy with your sovereign self. so, you bring on more of your genius, glory and compassion into our world. this, in turn, will bring you great financial fortune. much more importantly, you will be placed in a position of being able to make a bigger contribution. and nothing is as glamorous as helpfulness. every magician knows this truth well. the eighth symbol was of a tiny mountain climber. “nsi: never stop improving the quality of your mornings along with the excellence of your life,” the billionaire explained. he then let out one last loud yodel. the vineyard workers looked over and laughed uproariously. mr. riley waved and giggled with them. he then carried on with his discourse. “the whole game of the a-player is to always be rising. when you summit a high peak, you’ll see the next range of peaks waiting to be scaled. key metaphor there for you, cats.” he blew some dirt off the letter that corresponded with this magic charm and held it up for his students to see. here’s how it read: the billionaire’s maxim # continue raising your life standards toward absolute world-class. hedonic adaptation describes the psychological circumstance where human beings adapt to environmental and life changes. you receive the pay raise you’ve wanted for years, and you’re overjoyed for a day. then, this new income level becomes your new normal. the joy you felt fades. or, you move into a noisy apartment close to train tracks, yet over time you stop hearing the trains. or maybe the dream car you just purchased staggers you with excitement until, after a few weeks, it becomes just another part of the scenery. these are examples of hedonic adaptation in operation. and the phenomenon unfolds for each of us, inside all our lives. one antidote to this human way of existing is to constantly increase your personal standards and raise the quality of your life. make each quarter better than the last, and each year better than the previous one. this is how titans and legends roll. related to this is a very important philosophy that has served me well: go through life at world-class. life’s just too short not to treat yourself as amazingly as possible. and as you take better care of you, your relationship with others, with your work, with money and with"
sharma,"the world will be lifted correspondingly because your relationship with everything outside of yourself cannot help but be a demonstration of your relationship with all that is within you. this is just the way it is. invest in the finest books you can buy, and you’ll be rewarded in multiples. eat fantastic food of the highest caliber, even if all you can currently afford is an excellent starter salad at a luxurious local restaurant. go have a coffee at the greatest hotel in your city. if where you live has a professional sports team that you love, sit courtside for one game rather than hanging out in the cheap seats for a few seasons. drive the best car you possibly can. listen to joyful music daily. visit art galleries, like i have taught you, so the creativity and consciousness of the painters will rub off on your soul. and remember, be around flowers often—they raise your frequency as well as your ability to see the alternate universe all visionaries tap into. why do you think so many of the great saints, seers, healers and sages kept flowers beside them? you’ll be pleasantly stunned at what this does for your powers to generate all that you desire. magic charm number nine was a heart. and here’s what the associated letter said: the billionaire’s maxim # deep love yields unconquerable joy. any chance you get, show people love. a quote often attributed to william penn has guided most of my life and served me wonderfully. it goes, “i expect to pass through life but once. if, therefore, there can be any kindness i can show, or any good thing that i can do to any fellow-being, let me do it now, and not defer or neglect it, as i shall not pass this way again.” tell people how proud you are of them and how much you love them while you—and they—are still alive. i once met a man who told me he felt abounding happiness at the very sight of a live person. “why?” i asked him. “because i’ve seen so many dead people in my life that meeting someone alive is a special gift,” he said. not one of us knows when we’ll face our end. so, why hold back that which is most valuable: your human capacity to love deeply? part of your job as a fully alive human is to make people feel better about themselves. and to make others smile. it may shock you how little it takes to make someone happy. write old-school love letters to everyone you care about, thank-you notes to those who have helped you and messages of consideration for anyone you think needs some appreciation. express how you really feel without being limited by the devilish fear of rejection. and always be more interested in other people than being concerned with coming off as an interesting person. every human being you meet has a lesson to teach, a story to tell and some dream in their heart that longs for your support. our best selves will be shackled by the caring words we leave unspoken, the warm feelings we fail to display and the good deeds we leave undone. “here, take this, please,” the tycoon gently requested as he gave his guests a figure of an angel. “what’s on this page is especially important. i suggest you read it with a very open spirit.” the letter expressed the following: the billionaire’s maxim # heaven on earth is a state, not a place. take daily voyages into awe and regular adventures into wonder. wonder is such a potent source of happiness and a key skill in the promotion of your ever-increasing genius. all the great women and men of the world learned how to relax into the magic of a day enchantingly spent. through my experiments with life, i now understand that what the immortal philosophers, mystics and saviors called “heaven on earth” isn’t a place to visit but a state you can inhabit. trust me, as you cultivate your mindset, purify your heartset, optimize your healthset and elevate your soulset, the way you perceive and experience life will revolutionize your experience. but if you don’t do this profoundly important work, you’ll never know. and my words will seem like the ramblings of an old eccentric. a sane person in a world gone crazy has always been considered insane, you know? so, as you dedicate more time to personal mastery, the amount of self-love you feel will expand. and all lavish successes and private joys do depend on loving oneself. what keeps you in bondage to your doubts, insecurities and fears is low inner worth. because of what people told you about yourself in your early childhood, your subconscious mind discounts your braveness, smothers your highness and chains your greatness. as you let go of the false beliefs that you were taught are truths, and as you release the emotional wounds that closed you to love—and i’m speaking of something so much more than romance here—you will develop the ability to sense this all-new reality i’ve been hinting at. it has always been there. but because of the tainted filter through which you were seeing the world, you were blocked from knowing it. yet, nothing is wrong. there has been no waste. all is unfolding as it should. at your end, you will realize that very little of what happened to you was an accident. everything was for your growth. and all was for your good. the entrepreneur and the artist were mildly taken aback when they were shown the eleventh and final magic charm. “if you really want to play in the magic of life, reflect often on this one,” instructed the billionaire as he handed them a miniature coffin. this letter, unlike the previous ones, was written in red ink. it read: the billionaire’s maxim # tomorrow is a bonus, not a right. postpone not your heroism and never delay your"
sharma,"peacefulness. your life can fall apart within an hour. i am an optimist and a genuine merchant of hope. and yet i am also a realist. accidents, illness, loss and death happen every day. it’s human nature to think these things will never occur. yet, all wise philosophers teach us of the transience of our existence. armed with this insight, connect with your mortality. understand that your days are numbered. and with the passage of each glorious morning, you grow closer to your end. don’t put off expressing your gifts and talents. and make certain you enjoy this ride. have a good time as you rise toward your magnificence. it’s so sad how most people postpone having a beautiful, fun and magical life until they are too old to fully savor it. life absolutely is a sublime journey. yes, we all experience trials—and heartbreak. but it’s all mostly good. every hero story needs to have a villain as well as some juicy tragedy along with the triumphs and ultimate victory for it to be a tale worth watching. and so, keep the shortness of life at the forefront of your focus. don’t put off your happiness until you have more time, or you get the promotion, or you have more money in the bank. these are excuses, born of feelings that you are undeserving. sense them and then extract them from your orbit so that you can keep ascending into your loftiest realms. tomorrow is a promise, not a fact. enjoy every morning and appreciate each day you have on earth. take bold risks yet hedge them with common sense. balance living like there is no tomorrow with behaving like you’ll live forever. so that when the end does come, you’ll know you lived your life as a majestic testimony to the capacity for legendary that every human being carries inside of them. the billionaire then proceeded to kiss his students. “i love you two, you know. i’ll really miss you.” then he disappeared into the vineyard, leaving only his mountain bike. oceanofpdf.com c hapter the am club members

waterfront, a place where tourists ride the cape wheel, yacht racers replenish their supplies for courage-filled, adrenaline-fueled ocean contests, fishing charters may be booked and strong morning coffee can be found. the bubbly brunette with librarian glasses made sure the liability waivers were signed by the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist. she then stood on a leather sofa, made notes on her checklist and provided her three vip clients with the safety briefing that was mandatory before their helicopter whisked them to robben island. as you know, robben island—a barren, not-so-huge, shark-surrounded, ominous-looking parcel of land sitting not so far from the coast of cape town—is where nelson mandela was confined to an enormously tiny prison cell for eighteen of the twenty-seven years he was imprisoned. over time, this great hero of the world was attacked, abused and otherwise mistreated. and yet, he replied to this bad behavior with olive branches, seeing the good in his captors and guarding his hope for a democratic nation where all people would be equals. speaking about mahatma gandhi, einstein once said, “generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.” the same could be expressed of mr. mandela. “it’s an absolute pleasure to have you here for your short trip over to the island,” the woman indicated politely. south africans are remarkably well-mannered and thoughtful people. the billionaire wore a black baseball cap with the phrase “to lead is to be of use” stitched on the front of it. “you’ll have to take that off once you step onto the helipad, young man,” the woman told him with a golden glimmer in her eye. the billionaire beamed. “i think she likes me,” he whispered to his companions. “today’s our last day together,” he added matter-of-factly. after the safety instruction had been delivered, the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist were escorted out of the building and into a paved holding area where two weather-beaten picnic tables sat. though it was sunny, the winds were gusty. the billionaire removed his hat. “i feel a little anxious,” thought the billionaire. “i’ve never been to robben island. i’ve read a lot about what went on there under the inhumane and evil system of apartheid, which ranked the treatment of people according to their color of skin with no consideration for the caliber of their character—or the quality of their hearts.” a serious-looking young man wearing a slim raincoat, khaki trousers and boating shoes emerged from one of the empty maintenance bays and requested that the billionaire and his students follow him out to the helipad. an army green helicopter sat at the center of the area with its rotors spinning impressively. the pilot was at the controls, adjusting dials, knobs and the like. the young man meticulously made sure that all three clients were properly situated in the aircraft for a safe and even weight distribution, then placed a headphone with a microphone onto the billionaire’s head. “good morning,” boomed the billionaire enthusiastically to the helicopter pilot, as the rotors accelerated. the pilot’s face could not be seen beneath his helmet, aviator sunglasses and face protector. and he refused to say a word. “not so friendly,” muttered the billionaire, remaining both somewhat nervous yet positively excited for this once-in-a-lifetime experience that was about to unfold. the helicopter started rising, slowly initially then ascending quickly. “the trip will take about five minutes. winds and sea swells are extra strong today,” was all the pilot spoke. and even this he voiced curtly. the billionaire, the artist and the entrepreneur remained quiet. each of them simply stared at robben island,"
sharma,"a land mass that seemed more vast—and even more brutal—as they neared it. the aircraft landed on a pad surrounded by low trees and, as it did, seven springboks gracefully vaulted by. yes, seven springboks! at the same time, it began to rain. and another double rainbow, like the one that had appeared at the dolphin swim in mauritius, extended across the full length of the horizon that intersected with the atlantic ocean. “all very special,” observed the artist, arm in arm with his wife. “we’ve definitely entered the magic,” replied the billionaire in a respectful tone that conveyed an enormous appreciation for the opportunity to experience robben island and at the same delivered a sense of sadness for the valuable lives that had been ruined there. the pilot lingered in the cockpit, pressing buttons and turning off the helicopter while his three passengers exited onto the asphalt landing space and silently took in the scene. from out of nowhere, an old pickup truck with “ksa” marked on the side raced toward them, leaving voluminous clouds of dust in its wake. “you’re not supposed to be here,” shouted the driver, clearly a security guard, in a thick south african accent once he had reached the helicopter. he remained in his vehicle. “because of the weather, robben island has been closed to the public,” he called forcefully. “the ferries have all stopped running. no vessel can come to the port area here and no helicopters are allowed to land. you should have known about this! you should not be here! ” the officer emphasized, adding, “who are you people?” the guard did remain professional at all times. but he was visibly surprised. and obviously mildly shaken, perhaps imagining that the occupants of the aircraft had planned some kind of ground assault. and thinking the unexpected visitors had illicit intentions. “all is good here,” the pilot said with a firmness and confidence not often seen. he was now standing outside the helicopter and began to walk slowly toward the man in the truck, first adjusting his shirt then arranging his helmet, which he kept on. the pilot was not young. you could detect this from the way he walked. “this is a special day for them,” remarked the pilot, his voice getting louder. “these people have come a long way to see the prison cell where nelson mandela was jailed. they have come to view the limestone quarry where he was forced to hack away at stones for over a decade, in the torturous sun that reflected off the rock to the point where it damaged his eyesight permanently. they want to view the courtyard where the statesman would exercise and throw tennis balls with confidential messages inside to his fellow political prisoners in the next cell-block. they need to go to the spot where nelson mandela’s manuscript for long walk to freedom , his autobiography, would be secretly buried in the dirt after he’d spent many hours working on it. they need to experience—at least a little—the suffering mr. mandela endured over his eighteen grueling years here. and they must learn about how, even though he was so viciously treated—a theft of many of the best years of his life—once he was released, he chose to forgive all those who had been so cruel to him.” the pilot stopped in front of the pickup truck. “these people want to be genuine heroes themselves, i hear. in their professional and in their private lives. they wish to be leaders of their productivity, icons in full-on expression of their mastery and perhaps even path blazers in the fulfillment of a better humanity. our world has never been so in need of pure heroes as it is today. and, as i always teach when i present from the platform: why wait for them when you have it in you to become one of them? “wouldn’t you agree, stone?” asked the pilot, turning to speak to the billionaire, whose mouth instantly fell completely open. the pilot then, ever so gingerly, almost in slow motion, took off his face guard. next, he shed his sunglasses. and, finally, he removed his helmet. the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist were astonished by what they saw. it was the spellbinder. sterile and calculating fluorescent lighting kept the prison on robben island hauntingly eerie, even during the daytime. and feeling frugal, brutal and unsparing. a set of invisible hands seemed to be guiding the members of the am club on that fantastic south african morning because, by some precious symphony of synchronicity—the billionaire would call it “the magic”—the security guard who had raced up in the dusty pickup truck was a huge follower of the spellbinder’s. an “i’m your # fan” kind of fan. he loved the spellbinder’s work that much. and so—you won’t believe this but it really did happen—the head of housekeeping, after receiving a green light from the guard, started the tour bus that was out of commission that day because of the bad weather and drove it to where the visitors stood. she also asked one of the few guides still on the island to raise the flag and open the prison for a totally private tour. just for the billionaire, the entrepreneur, the artist and the spellbinder. in every life, especially the hardest ones, doorways of possibility and gateways into the miraculous swing open, revealing the reality that everything that each one of us experiences is part of some intelligent—and yes, often illogical—plan meant to draw us nearer to our greatest powers, most wonderful circumstances and highest good. everything we go through as we travel through a life is, in truth, a fantastic orchestration designed to introduce us to our truest talents, connect us with our most sovereign selves and deepen our intimacy with the glorious hero that lives inside each of us. yes, within every single one of us . and that does mean you. the tour guide, who also happened to be"
sharma,"a former political prisoner, was a large man with a gruff voice. as he led his guests toward the cell where nelson mandela was forced to live for so many long and harsh years, he answered each of the questions they asked. “did you know nelson mandela?” queried the spellbinder thoughtfully. “yes, i served with him for eight years here on robben island.” “what was he like as a person?” asked the artist, appearing overwhelmed by the emotions that he was feeling as they walked down the main corridor of the jail that had been home to so many atrocities during the apartheid era. “oh,” said the guide gently with a gracious and even wise smile across his face, “that man was a humble servant.” “and what was nelson mandela like as a leader?” pressed the entrepreneur. “tremendous. dignified. inspirational by the way he handled himself and all he went through. every time he met one of his fellow leaders, often it was here in this courtyard,” commented the guide as he stepped into the area where the political prisoners would walk, talk, plan and stand, “he would ask, ‘are you learning?’ he’d also often say, ‘each one, teach one,’ in this way mentoring his associates on the importance of sharing their daily learning to increase the leadership capability of all those around them. mr. mandela understood that education is the ultimate highway into freedom. “that man was treated so poorly. all those hours of back-breaking work in the limestone quarry. all the degradation and humiliation. a few years after he came here, he was ordered to dig a grave in the prison yard—and then to lie in it,” the tour guide added. “he must have thought that was the end,” reflected the billionaire, softly. “probably,” replied the guide. “instead, the guards unzipped their pants. and urinated over him.” the spellbinder, the billionaire, the entrepreneur and the artist all looked down. “we all have our own robben islands that can keep us imprisoned, i guess,” the billionaire mused. “as we go through life we endure our own trials and injustices. nothing as severe as what went on here, of course. i read that nelson mandela said his greatest regret was not being allowed out of this prison to attend the funeral of his eldest son after he was killed in a car accident,” expressed the billionaire. he looked up to the sky. “i guess we all have our regrets. and no one gets out without their own ordeals and tragedies.” the tour guide pointed to the fourth window, to the right of the entrance into the courtyard. “there,” he stated. “that’s nelson mandela’s cell. let’s go in.” the cell was incredibly small. no bed. a small wooden table that the prisoner would kneel at to write in his journal as there was no chair, a concrete floor and a brown woolen blanket, with green and red flecks in it. “for the first year of his imprisonment, nelson mandela wasn’t even permitted to wear long pants, though it was freezing over the south african winter. he was given only a thin shirt and flimsy shorts. when he showered, the guards stood and watched this elderly man standing naked, an attempt to humiliate—and break—him. when it was time to eat, he was given food unfit for an animal. when letters would arrive from his wife and children, often they wouldn’t be delivered. or if they were, they would be significantly censored. all this was carefully done to crush mr. mandela’s spirit,” the guide explained. “it seems to me all that he endured in this shoebox of a jail cell, on this desolate island encircled by a raging ocean, developed him, strengthened him and opened him . the prison became his crucible. the mistreatment became his salvation, leading him into his natural power, highest humanity and fullest state of unstained heroism. in a world of such selfishness, apathy and people disconnected from what it means to be human, he used what he was presented with to grow into an advanced soul on the planet—a man who would show the rest of us what leadership, fortitude and love look like. and in so doing, he became one of our great emblems of forgiveness. and finest symbols of peace,” the spellbinder offered. “yes, indeed,” replied the tour guide. “when mr. mandela was ultimately released from robben island, he was transferred to what is now called drakenstein correctional centre, between paarl and franschhoek. his ascension to the presidency of south africa was inevitable, so he was being prepared to assume the position and to lead a free yet enormously divided nation. during that final period of his incarceration, he was given the warden’s home. and on the day of his release, he walked out of this residence, over to a long paved road with a guard post and a white gate at the end of it. nelson mandela was asked by prison personnel if he’d prefer to be driven down this road to freedom. he refused and indicated simply that he would rather walk. and so, this transformational leader and history-maker who has left a legacy that will inspire many generations took halting steps toward his long-awaited liberation.” the tour guide took a long, weary breath. then he carried on. “mr. mandela was given a country on the cusp of a civil war. yet, somehow, he managed to become a unifier instead of a destroyer. i still remember the words from the famous speech he gave during one of his trials: during my lifetime i have dedicated myself to this struggle of the african people. i have fought against white domination, and i have fought against black domination. i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. it is an ideal for which i hope to live for and to see realized. but … if it needs be, it is an"
sharma,"ideal for which i am prepared to die. mr. riley cleared his throat. he kept looking at the cement floor of the tiny cell. “mr. mandela was a true hero,” confirmed the guide. “after his release he invited the prosecutor who demanded the death penalty for him to dinner. can you believe that? and he asked one of the jailers who watched over him here on robben island to attend his inauguration as the president of south africa.” “really?” the entrepreneur asked quietly. “yes, that’s a fact,” responded the tour guide. “he was a real leader, a man of genuine forgiveness.” the spellbinder raised a finger to signal he wished to share another point: “nelson mandela wrote, ‘as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, i knew if i didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, i’d still be in prison.’” “he also said that ‘to be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others,’” the guide added. “and that ‘no one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. people must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.’” “i read he’d often get up around am and run on the spot for forty-five minutes, then perform two hundred sit-ups and then do one hundred fingertip push-ups. that’s the reason i’m always doing my push-ups,” the billionaire contributed, somewhat awkwardly. “hmm,” said the tour guide before continuing, “mr. mandela came into this cell as a hot-headed, angry, hostile and militant young man. it was who he grew into here in this prison that made him the icon we all now revere. as archbishop desmond tutu taught us, ‘suffering can either embitter us or ennoble us.’ thankfully, madiba—which was his clan name—chose the latter.” “all the best men and women of the world have one thing in common,” said the spellbinder: “extreme suffering. and each of them evolved into their greatness because they chose to leverage their circumstances to heal, purify and uplift themselves.” the spellbinder then pulled out a learning model from his jacket, the final one that the two students would see. it was called the heroic human circle . here’s what it looked like: “these are the virtues each of us must aspire to, to become world-changers and heroes for the benefit of a better society,” said the spellbinder, his voice filled this morning with hints of both melancholy and immense strength. “leadership is for everyone. each of us, no matter where we live, what we do, what’s happened to us in the past and what we’re experiencing right now, must release the shackles of blame, chains of hate, leg irons of apathy and prison bars of ordinary that keep us in slavery to the dark forces of our lowest nature. every one of us must rise each morning—yes, at am— and do everything we can possibly do to unfold our genius, develop our talents, deepen our character and escalate our spirits. each of us must do this, across our world.” the spellbinder began to cry as he went on. “we all must break free from our private jails that incarcerate our glory and keep our nobility in bondage. please remember that gifts and talents neglected become curses and sorrows.” the spellbinder paused. “it’s your time,” he stated, looking directly into the eyes of the entrepreneur and the artist. the heroic human circle framework had been placed on the small table in the chamber that sat under the window with bars. the spellbinder dragged it to the center of the space, so it became the focus in the prison cell, on that very special day. the spellbinder then asked the billionaire, the entrepreneur, the artist and the tour guide to crowd around the diagram. they held one another’s hands. “yes, no matter what struggles we face and what adversities we will endure. no matter what attacks, humiliation and violence are visited on us. we must persist. we must continue. we must stay strong. we must live our luminous nature. and magnify our sovereign selves. even if it feels the whole world is against us. this is truly what makes us human beings. even if it seems the light will never transcend the darkness, keep making your walk to freedom. model what’s highest for the rest of us. exemplify grace, for the majority of us. demonstrate actual love , for all of us. “now is your moment,” said the spellbinder, raising a hand and placing it on the arm of the artist. he gently rested the other one on the shoulder of the entrepreneur. a quiet smile stretched across his face. he looked poised. and serene. “time for what?” wondered the artist. “to start your pilgrimage,” was the simple reply. “to where?” asked the entrepreneur, looking a little confused. “to a territory called legacy,” indicated the spellbinder. “a lot of people are tourists at this place. for fleeting minutes of their precious mornings, they think about the body of work they’ve built and what it is that they’ll leave behind, once they die. for brief intervals, before they get distracted, they reflect on the quality of their productivity, the degree of their decency and the depth of their impact. for mere short stints, before the bustle of being busy consumes them again, they pause to contemplate how beautifully they’ve lived and how helpful they were. they are mere visitors to this realm.” mr. riley lifted his arms high as he listened to his mentor’s words. “i love my life. i will become an even better leader. i will make an even greater contribution. and i’ll upgrade into a much more inspirational human being,” he whispered, mostly to himself. “the distinguished heroes of humankind,” resumed the spellbinder,"
sharma,"“were citizens and lifetime inhabitants of this territory of legacy. it was their homeland. and this is what ultimately made them legendary. the mighty mission they constructed their lives around was to exist for a cause that was larger than themselves. so, when they died, they left our world brighter than they found it.” “we all come with an expiration date,” added the billionaire. “none of us knows how long we get to live.” “true,” agreed the entrepreneur. “today,” the spellbinder declared, “and this very moment, deserves and demands your commitment to become sublimely creative, pristinely productive, decadently decent and of service to many. please stop postponing your mastery. no longer resist your primal power. refrain from allowing the shadow forces of fear, rejection, doubt and disappointment to dim the light of your most luminous self. this is your time. and now is your day: to make your leap, in your original way, into the rare-air of the finest leaders who have ever lived. and to enter the universe of the true masters, eminent virtuosos and authentic heroes who have been responsible for all progress of civilization.” all five were still huddled in the circle. mr. riley began to yodel, a little—before the spellbinder’s strong stare helped him to tone it down. they smiled at one another. a clear gesture of mutual respect. “to lead is to inspire others by the way that you live. to lead is to walk through the fires of your hardest times to step up into forgiveness. to lead is to remove any form of mediocrity from infiltrating the quarters of your life in a dazzling celebration of the majesty that is your birthright. to lead is to turn your terrors into triumphs and translate each of your heartbreaks into heroism. and more than all else, to lead is to be a force for good on this tiny planet of ours. today, you get to accept this grand call to raise the standard by which you live out the remainder of your life.” “or at least starting tomorrow,” the billionaire suggested with a mischievous grin. “starting at am ,” they all said together. “own your morning. elevate your life!” oceanofpdf.com e pilogue five years later a few months after his time on robben island, stone riley passed away. he died peacefully in his sleep in a small apartment in the historic center of rome. his loving daughter was at his side. as was the spellbinder. on the day of the titan’s death, more doves and butterflies took flight over the eternal city than ever before. there was even a double rainbow that extended all the way from the spanish steps to the colosseum. you would have been impressed, if you had been there to see it. the billionaire had been suffering from a rare and incurable disease which he had told no one about, except for the spellbinder. because he was his best friend. you’ll be happy to know that, during his last days, the eccentric tycoon completely liquidated the various ventures of his vast business empire. and gave the entire amount to charity. mr. riley did decide to leave his oceanside compound in mauritius to the entrepreneur and the artist, as he knew how much they loved being there. allow me to share what has happened to the entrepreneur and the artist since the time of that most surreal adventure they had with the billionaire. i know you’re probably wondering. the entrepreneur has become a fabulously wealthy woman, having grown the company she founded into an iconic enterprise. she has let go of the demons of her past that haunted her for so long and absolutely loves the life she shares with her husband, the artist. she still works hard, but she also enjoys her time off a lot. she just completed her fourth marathon, has taken a great liking to gardening and volunteers at a shelter for homeless people every tuesday night. she no longer cares much about fame, fortune and worldly power, even though she now has all these things. the artist, you’ll be fascinated to learn, has become one of the most celebrated painters in his field. he completely beat his procrastination issues, is widely considered a master of his craft and is an extraordinary husband. he ran two marathons with his wife and has now become a vegan. he goes to yodeling classes on wednesday nights. and get this: the couple has a wonderfully handsome and ever so intelligent little boy. they named him stone. the entrepreneur and the artist are still members of the am club, running the // formula every morning well before daybreak. they still practice most of the disciplines mr. riley taught them. and they’ve kept the promise they made to their mentor to tell as many people as possible about the transformational value of rising early. as for the spellbinder, he’s still alive. in many ways, he’s going stronger than ever. he’s based out of tokyo but still spends much of his life on stages in stadiums across the planet, on airplanes and in hotel rooms. he still loves fishing. oceanofpdf.com about the

sharma,"work, i can see the olive grove, vineyards, and a vast mist floating over the hills that seem to reach for the heavens. it would be good if you were here with me so i could tell you, in person, everything i wish to share about a life richly lived. maybe we can do this in the future. let’s see. my sincere wish—as you pass through this book that i have written to help you live the highest version of the greatest vision you have of your life—is that i earn more and more of your trust as the book unfolds. and become your companion, friend, and mentor. i humbly and honestly thank you for believing in the value of the ideas you are about to discover on leading an existence filled with true success and real wealth rather than the fake version that has been programmed into too many good people. i hope this book that i’ve worked so hard on will serve you to make a life of far greater beauty and happiness, courage and connection, along with an inner peace that has no bounds. please note that my philosophy of what makes a great and glorious human life—on which this work is based—is very different from that of other books in the personal development field. i simply ask you to keep an open mind as we progress through it and measure whether the information is valuable by the actual results it delivers into your days. okay. let us begin. there’s an old story of a young boy who spends his evenings in the countryside watching the sun set over a perfect home on a faraway hill, with windows that appear to be made of gold. he is utterly consumed by the idea of—some time in the future—making the journey to visit this place and hopefully, eventually, living in it. for to do so would give him the happiness he so deeply desires. one day when he’s slightly older, he sets out to make his dream real. he journeys for many days and even long nights, surviving solely on the kindness of strangers who encourage him to keep on walking when they hear of his ambition to visit the perfect home, with windows of pure gold. eventually, exhausted and spent, the boy arrives at his destination. yet of course, it’s not at all what he saw it to be. instead of perfection, the house is a broken-down barn. and rather than the windows being made of perfect gold, they are old, dirty, and cracked. he realizes that, from afar, the barn’s position on the lofty hill had created an optical illusion: the lightfall on the windows made them seem fashioned of precious metal. but what he had seen from a distance was a lie. oh, what a world we live in! we are trained to measure whether we are winning by the amount of money we have, the size of the possessions we own, and how well we have used our best days in pursuit of fame, fortune, and influence. this causes too many of us, deep within our souls, to feel bad about our lives, sad about ourselves, and mad that the dreams we once had such faith in have been destroyed, dying a quiet death as we replaced them with adult responsibilities, life’s stresses, and human struggles. sure, money is important. having a reasonable amount allows us to lead easier lives, live life on our own terms, and do good things for the people we love. having enough opens more windows of possibility and doorways of choice. yet money is only one form of wealth—there are actually seven other forms i’d like you to focus on, so we get you to a life that you feel is honestly rich, deeply alive, and everything you once hoped it would be. i’ll teach you these, along with a very powerful method, with all the enthusiasm i have, as we move ahead together. sometimes we’re so busy looking at what others own that we forget all the blessings we have. and i’m not only writing about material things when i say this. i’m writing more about the essential elements of a human life beautifully lived. ones that are just too easy to neglect in this fast, overly complex, and continuously messy world you and i now find ourselves in. things that may now seem unimportant yet when you’re at your final hour of your last day come into clear focus as being the most important. one of the reasons i wrote the wealth money can’t buy is that so many people—across this planet—are suffering. suffering from thinking and feeling that they don’t have enough. enough money. enough material possessions. enough likes, followers, and social status. this, in turn, causes what i call in my mentoring work the suffering of unworthiness. too many among us have a profound sense that we just don’t matter and that we just aren’t successful and that our lives are too small, when compared to lives we are told are perfect and big. here’s the truth: you are absolutely and uniquely and undeniably enough. you have such gifts, talents, and goodness. and so very much to be grateful for, right now. yet so many have a sort of hole within us. and here’s the trap: we push ourselves mercilessly to seek more and more external things to fill that hole. falsely telling ourselves that when we have overflowing cash and flashy cars and fashionable clothes and online followers, one day, we will magically wake up feeling okay. and lastingly happy. yet you and i know that day will never come. because nothing in the outer world will ever make you feel better on the inside. as the zen proverb confirms: “wherever you go, there you are.” so what’s the solution? simple: to understand that what you are chasing in this collective pursuit of climbing the popular mountain of success—which society has trained us to climb—will"
sharma,"not lead you to real success. because reaching the summit of money but getting there feeling empty, lonely and unhappy, isn’t winning. it’s losing. you don’t want to be like that young boy in the story i shared who chases an ideal only to learn it was a lie. “success occurs in the privacy of the soul,” wrote famed music producer rick rubin. worldly success without a joyful heart is fool’s gold. my humble prayer is that you experience both. the book you hold in your hands is my gentle offering that will lead you to experience the genuine victories, soaring cheerfulness, and magic—yes, magic—that makes a human life great. i’ve poured my mind, heart, body, and spirit into this work. i hope it serves your rise marvelously well. with love and respect, oceanofpdf.com introduction the other night, elle sat on the sofa next to me, in the living room of our farmhouse in the italian countryside. we moved here a few years ago, with the most important possessions of my life stuffed into three suitcases. i needed a new adventure, so i sold my home, gave away many of my things, and left the country i’d lived in for fifty-five years. after we landed in rome, we waited at the baggage carousel, excited by the beginning of our fresh life. then we waited some more and then a little more. yes, our luggage was lost. the universe has a hilarious sense of humor, doesn’t it? anyway, on this evening at the farmhouse that i was just about to describe to you, elle’s little dog, holly, who has now become my little dog as she’s pretty much with me all the time, sat on my lap—sort of purring like a cat (yet she really is a dog). i call holly “superchum,” because that’s exactly what she is to me. looking out the ancient window frames, i saw the sun-setting sky all fiery and enchanting with hues of red and hints of burnt orange. it was magic, in its simplest form. italy does that to you. a friend recently told me, “you cry twice when you live here. first when you get here, because it’s not the most efficient place in the world. and then you cry a second time, whenever you have to leave.” yes, it’s that special. elle had a soft smile on her face. and sometimes a few tears in her eyes. she was reading the manuscript of this book, for the first time. the whole scene was super simple. and profoundly perfect. it made me think these words: “this is rich.” i’m certainly not saying my life is or has ever been ideal. not at all. i’ve experienced dramatic difficulties and endured some monumentally hard times. i’ve been knocked down, kicked around, betrayed, and deeply dismayed. and i sure don’t want you to think that i’m some kind of guru who knows it all. because i am not. yet i have discovered how to turn setbacks into strengths, wounds into wisdom, problems into prosperity. i have earned a lot of hard-won lessons on living beautifully to share with you, in our time together, on the pages ahead. i once had a ski instructor who helped me ski better (because that’s what ski instructors do). while we were riding the ski lift up the mountain one day he said, “you know, ski instructors aren’t rich, but we have a rich life.” and that man—with always-rosy cheeks from the sunshine and cold, a wife he adored, children he cherished, and a lifetime spent on a mountain with views that left me breathless—was the wealthiest person i’ve ever known. this is what the wealth money can’t buy is all about: the real riches that often sit right in front of us, but we ignore because we have been programmed not to value them. makes me think of this quote by dale carnegie: “we are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses blooming outside our windows today.” true, right? let me ask you: “why does our culture worship the billionaire, yet not the teacher who finds a way to inspire a class of twenty children week after week? or the firefighter whose heroic dedication helps to keep us safe in our communities and homes? or the gardener who makes the street more marvelous through their tireless efforts to plant, nurture, and water the neighborhood’s flowers?” this book is about a completely new philosophy and methodology of success and wealth that we are not schooled, trained, or even encouraged to consider. but one that will absolutely bring you sustained happiness, personal freedom, and lasting internal peace. now, as i’ve mentioned, i do agree that money is important. we all have bills to pay, obligations to meet, and pursuits to engage in that cost cash. and having strong savings and financial abundance allows you to live with less stress, more freedom, and a sense of personal sovereignty (doing what you want, where you want, when you want—with the people you love). so yes, money is an essential element to your richest life. i must be extremely clear on that. it’s something important yet not everything important. as you’ll see in the learning framework i’m about to offer you (one that i’ve taught to my private advisory clients for many years with excellent results), financial prosperity is only one of the eight forms of wealth. i’ve mentored many billionaires over my nearly three decades of working with many of the world’s business titans, professional sports superstars, film icons, and movement-makers. and i can safely tell you that, for too many of them, money is all they have. they are cash rich yet life poor. you really need to be doing well in each of the eight forms of wealth to be able to call yourself truly successful and someone who is really living abundantly. and beautifully. on the pages ahead, we will carefully consider each of"
sharma,"the eight forms of wealth shown above, in a way that is easy to apply, fun to understand, and powerful in the difference it will make in your days. in short chapters designed to be personal daily mentoring sessions, i will provide you with ideas, suggestions, instructions, and stories of inspiration so you can more fully live each one of them. and as you do, you will see that you will be rewarded with your richest life. the forms of wealth learning model is based upon eight hidden (because they are not so commonly considered) habits that i energetically urge you to embrace: growth: the daily self-improvement habit. this habit is based on the insight that humans are happiest and genuinely wealthiest when we are steadily realizing our personal gifts and primal talents. the regular pursuit of personal growth is one of your most valuable assets. wellness: the steadily optimize your health habit. this habit is founded on your deep understanding that peak mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual vitality and living a long life filled with energy, wellness, and joyfulness are mission-essential to you being honestly rich. family: the happy family, happy life habit. this habit is built on the knowledge that having all the money and material success in the world is worthless if you are all alone. so enrich the connections with the ones you love. and fill your life with fantastic friends who upgrade your happiness. craft: the work as a platform for purpose habit. this habit is grounded in the consistent practice of seeing your work as a noble pursuit and an opportunity not only to make more of your genius real, but also to make our world a better place. mastery is a currency worth investing in. money: the prosperity as fuel for freedom habit. this habit is driven by the principle that financial abundance is not only far from evil but also a necessity for living in a way that is generous, fascinating, and original. community: the you become your social network habit. this habit is structured around the scientific fact that a human being’s thinking, feeling, behaving, and producing are profoundly influenced by their associations, conversations, and mentors. to lead a great life, fill your circle with great people. adventure: the joy comes from exploring not possessing habit. this habit is formulated around the reality that what creates vast joy is not material goods but magical moments doing things that flood us with feelings of gratefulness, wonder, and awe. enrich your days with these and your life will rise into a whole new universe of inspiration. service: the life is short so be very helpful habit. this habit is founded on the time-honored understanding that the main aim of a life richly lived is to make the lives of others better. as you lose yourself in a cause that is bigger than you, you will not only find your greatest self but will illuminate the world in the process. and discover treasures far beyond the limits of cash, possessions, and public status. all right. thank you again for your faith in my work and for joining me here. now, let us start. so we fill your days with the wealth money can’t buy. oceanofpdf.com the st form of wealth growth the daily self-improvement habit the wealth within you, your essence, is your kingdom. —rumi oceanofpdf.com the st form of wealth growth | quick overview to grow into all you can possibly be is a prize far more precious than anything money could ever buy. personal mastery is a currency that will make you authentically wealthy. and your wisest investment is making yourself into all you can be. to explore your unfaced fears, to release sabotaging limitations, to venture into the unknown fields of your native potential and to know how wise, strong, gifted, resilient, and loving you are will bring more magic into your life than all the fame, fortune, and worldly success one could ever have. inner growth and daily personal development are a very real form of wealth, though our society generally doesn’t value them. instead, in our current age, it’s the billionaire financial titan who is placed on the front cover and the famed sports superstar placed on a pedestal instead of the person who has made the making of a pure mind, the building of a rich heart, the construction of a heavyweight character, and the growing of a soaring spirit their primary priority. to me, winning within is so much more important than winning in the world. the first is enduring. the second is fleeting. yet just because our culture doesn’t put self-improvement and the ongoing realization of your natural powers and primal genius near the top of any list of the things that matter most to a journey well-lived doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t. you should, actually. mahatma gandhi once said, “the only devils in the world are those running around inside ourselves. this is where the battle should be fought.” and please trust me: once you get the value of deepening your personal growth, everything will change for you. because a brilliant outer life begins with a beautiful interior one. and you will never be able to create, produce, prosper, and savor any higher than what you are. okay, my new friend, let’s explore the first form of wealth, together. oceanofpdf.com honor your greatness a simple idea that’s too often neglected. to appreciate you . for all you’ve gone through and all you’ve become. for all the fears you’ve faced and found freedom from. for the dreams you not only dreamed but had the bravery to make real. for all the people you’ve helped and for all the good you have done. you matter more than you know. so please do not measure your worthiness by what the majority tells you that you should be, do and have. you being here with me is no accident, at all. something in you—in a culture where too many"
sharma,"fine people are sleepwalking through their most precious hours in a digital slumber—seeks something higher. i sense that although life can be hard at times, you have not lost your hope. you’ve protected your optimism for your brighter future and trusted that call within your soul to fully realize your ethical ambitions for all the time you get to live. this—to my getting-sort-of-old eyes—makes you a hero. you’ve been through a lot. you could have given up. and become jaded, cynical, critical, and closed-hearted. yet, instead, here you are. ready to rise, passionate to advance and dedicated to grow through the guidance you are receiving through me, as your mentor. it’s an act of high courage to be willing to let go of who you were yesterday to become someone even better, wiser, healthier, and happier tomorrow, you know? oh, and i really should reinforce that personal development work is the best work you could ever do. a lot of people snicker or roll their eyes (or both) when they hear the term “self-improvement.” yet what is more courageous and sensible than steadily and incrementally doing the deep training to turn everyday human insecurity into rare-air confidence, personal limitation into uncommon prowess, and an average mode of rolling through life into a breathtakingly exceptional journey that honors the promise you have been born into? “the most important investment you can make is in yourself,” noted renowned financier warren buffett. and the finest strategy to make the world better is to make yourself better, right? as you rework, elevate and calibrate your inner universe, your relationship with what i call in my mentoring methodology your heroic self (which is the opposite of your egoic self, the false, faulty, restricted, and scared part of you that has been formed by the negative beliefs and human hurts that you’ve endured in your past) will definitely increase. and when your primary relationship with your greatest self increases, every other relationship in your life increases too. build stronger knowledge and intimacy with your heroic self (through the philosophies and tools i’ll walk you through) and your relationship with your family, vitality, work, prosperity, community, adventure, and service to others will fly with it. by the way, you should know right now that i come from humble beginnings. no silver spoon in my mouth. born in africa. came from immigrant parents. two years ago, i took my life partner, elle, to see the house i grew up in. the current owner was watering the lawn when we walked up to the place. i told him that i used to live in his home, over fifty years ago. so he invited us in. nice man. smiled a lot. after we left, elle said, “that’s the smallest house i’ve ever seen.” i felt the same way. and i grew up with a ton of flaws—as all humans do. filled with thoughts of scarcity, emotions of timidity, sensations of insecurity and methods of operating that chained my talents, restrained my optimism, and smothered my freedom. yet one thing saved—and transformed—me: a limitless (and sometimes obsessive) love of growth. if i didn’t know how to improve something, i could learn how to do it. all i longed to become and everything i dreamed of experiencing could happen by enriching my understanding. of course, you can do this too . which is why i’m so excited for you. as i write these words, i am reminded of what the philosopher and writer ayn rand wrote: do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. the world you desire can be won, it exists, it is real, it’s yours. such are the wishes that i hold dear for you. oceanofpdf.com live the outer change follows inner change law as i write you this mentoring message i do hope you’re in great spirits, full of enthusiasm (what a great word that is!), and in hot pursuit of a gorgeous life that you’ll be proud of when you’re an old-timer. and if you’re already an old-timer, then my prayer is that you’re already proud of your life. i was up at three this morning ( went to sleep just after pm ) so i could meditate, visualize, and pray. then i hopped onto my elliptical machine. it’s my favorite piece of exercise equipment, unless we include my trusted mountain bike. that one’s tops for me. when i first met elle—on our second date, to be accurate—the first thing i showed her when she visited my home was my mountain bike. she later confided that she thought that was a little strange. but all these years later she’s still with me. so i guess it was an okay move. anyway, i need to share a story. one evening a father sat in his favorite chair, reading a newspaper. his young son sat near him. “dad, let’s play,” the boy said cheerfully. but the man was too busy being an adult and kept on studying his paper. “daddy, let’s play! let’s have fun,” the little boy said. yet the father paid him no attention. he continued his reading. the child persisted and the man ignored him. finally, the father had an idea. there was a picture of the globe in the newspaper, so he tore it out, ripped it into dozens of pieces, and handed it to his son, saying, “here, go put this back together,” thinking it would take the child a long time to do it. yet children come to us more highly evolved than adults to teach us the lessons we need to learn. and after only a few minutes the boy came back with the globe perfectly back together. “how’d you do that, son?” the father asked, astonished. “easy, dad. on the other side of"
sharma,"the globe was a person. and once i got the person together, the world was okay.” powerful idea, right? once you get yourself together, your world will be okay—more than okay. fantastic, actually, if you practice the philosophies, methods, routines, and tactics that i’m super excited to share with you (nothing works for someone unwilling to do any work, yes?). one of the brain tattoos i love sharing with my audiences when i do a keynote presentation in some city across this small planet is this: “victims make excuses; leaders deliver results.” to be a leader doesn’t mean you must have a title, a position, authority, or a ton of money. nope, not at all. leadership’s just the opposite of victimhood. and human beings giving away their power to create wonderful results by complaining, blaming, and expecting others to make things better for them are people caught in the trap of playing the victim. the other day i was in a ride-sharing car with a cool young driver. as we chatted, he shared that he arrived as an immigrant with $ in his pocket. that was all the money he had in his life. yet, by his focus, hard work, and relentless desire to grow, he saved up enough to buy a house and was now supporting eleven (yes, eleven!) of his family members. he could have complained of his hard past, blamed his mean childhood, and waited for something outside of himself to improve his days. but he didn’t. he started small, made steady daily gains, and transformed his situation over time. this ride-share driver delivered results instead of making excuses. and he told me his real secret was his deep dedication to constant self-improvement, which is really all about growth—the first form of wealth. for some reason this man’s story makes me think of the words of the warrior poet charles bukowski: “can you remember who you were, before the world told you who you should be?” we should end this chapter on that. because i need a break from writing and my trusty mountain bike is waiting for me. oceanofpdf.com don’t be a resentment collector someone looks at us the wrong way. someone close to us disappoints us. someone we trusted lies to us. such things are part of the essence of life. you can’t avoid them, much as you try. when we are not treated as we wish to be treated, it’s so easy to get angry. or to withdraw. or to harbor a secret resentment. and as we advance through life and interact with other human beings, it’s easy to keep adding to what i call the resentment stack. you just keep getting discouraged, and rather than processing through the emotions of hurt, frustration, and irritation these experiences create so you are free of them, you just swallow them all. and wallow in them. and let the resentments fester, like a great gaping wound (that stains every moment you experience and tarnishes your creativity, productivity, prosperity and serenity). you’re wise and bright, and you pick really great mentors, so you already know: this is not the best way to live. wounds unhealed become potential unrealized, along with a serious drain on your energy—energy that could be used to create soaring results and to enjoy this supreme gift and expedition that is your life. and also remember this: the bigger your resentment stack grows, the more it colors the way you see everything . you start seeing slights that weren’t even there. you begin to perceive people doing mean things that they didn’t really do. you begin to believe that this sometimes difficult yet also utterly amazing universe we live in is a very scary place. we see things not as they are but as we are, right? so my sincere suggestion for you, as i sip my fresh mint tea infused with a sliver of ginger and listen to kolby cooper’s enchanting country music song “fall,” while a very noisy rooster continues to wake up the world, is to become a master of letting things go . sure—of course—protect yourself and stand up for good treatment. that’s obvious and we do teach people how to treat us. you must never allow anyone to walk over you. yet i also carefully suggest that you increase your compassion for others. we don’t know what battle they are fighting. and everyone around us really is doing their best. (even if their best is a mess.) and while this does not mean they shouldn’t be held accountable for the things they do, it does mean they deserve our understanding. just imagine how bright a human life you’ll create if you operate in the rare air of seeking to see the blessings in the people who try to curse you. such is the behavior of history’s greatest souls. and a truly wealthy person. “in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i’ve been turning over in my mind ever since. ‘whenever you feel like criticizing anyone just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had,’ ” said nick carraway, the narrator in f. scott fitzgerald’s majestic novel the great gatsby . get this one piece right and your daily joy and overall peacefulness will escalate exponentially. and by the life you lead, you’ll subtly prompt peace to break out, all across the planet. oceanofpdf.com it’s okay to be sloppy “be perfect” and “be super tidy” and “have cut abs,” our society schools us. what nonsense! is it not a mark of high wisdom to live a richly balanced life? there are times to exercise world-class willpower (while creating an inspiring work project, pursuing an important physical fitness goal, or realizing a meaningful spiritual venture, for example) and model heroic self-discipline. then there are periods meant for leaning back, resting more, doing little, and simply being a human being . and when i say in the title of"
sharma,"this mentoring message that it’s okay to be sloppy, in certain seasons of your life’s journey, i don’t just mean not making your bed when you don’t feel like it or keeping your schedule empty so you give yourself the freedom to be bored. i also mean it’s okay to be less than perfect when it comes to your inner life. self-mastery and personal growth must never be a grind. otherwise, you’ll drain the magic out of the entire enterprise. last night, i watched an online video of a man saying that we should treat ourselves like a slab of rock, striking ourselves to our most extreme edges to sculpt something beautiful. his energy was intense, aggressive, and seemingly angry. i get his point. i sure do. we can’t constantly give in to weak impulses every hour yet hope to have a life of excellence, satisfaction, and awe. got it. send me the t-shirt with the logo on it. some of the messaging from the hustle and grind culture has some truth to it. happy things happen to people who do hard things. yet, to me, a glorious human experience must have some mess to it. some times of “strategic laziness” in it. some breathtaking days of serious sloppiness. where we just allow ourselves to leave the bed unmade, the call unanswered, and the dishes unwashed. we’re not machines, we’re humans. i guess what i’d like you to consider is to trust the flow more. stop resisting your natural rhythms. embrace the seasons when it doesn’t seem like much is happening as the farmer accepts the fallow season as well as the times of harvest, understanding that without the first one the spectacular growth of the latter one would really not be possible. honor the days where you have all the drive in the world. and rest more on the days that you don’t. oceanofpdf.com memorize the penam principle have you ever wondered how you became the person that you are? ever considered what unfolded to make you you ? (which, by the way, is the only you exactly like you on the planet today.) my answer can be said with a five-letter acronym: penam. yes, that’s my answer. your core beliefs, basic behaviors, daily habits, and general ways of being were caused and created by the five forces that the acronym penam represents. the “p” is for your parents . sure, they most likely had good intentions, but the fact is that they also passed their faulty programming on to you. they did the best they could, based on what they knew and what their parents taught them. if they had money scars and had restricted thinking around financial abundance, you adopted those too (because a child assumes the thinking and subconsciously models the modes of behaving of the caregivers who teach them how the world works). if your parents believed that life was meant to be tragic, that most people are mean, and that human beings have no agency over the way things turn out, you accepted these beliefs and installed these habits. and rehearsed them so many times they actually became your truths and reality. even if they were wrong. the “e” stands for your environment . your ecosystem has a dramatic impact on the way you show up each day. allow mediocre inputs into your personal orbit, like violent tv shows, toxic news feeds and the messaging of narcissistic online influencers and, over time, these forces will degrade your positivity, performance, and joyfulness. also, the surroundings you were raised in during the formative years that shaped your identity have had a huge effect on who you currently are in the world. “n” stands for nation . if you grew up in a war zone or a country that suffers from social volatility, this will deeply affect the way you see things. if you are from a nation that is prosperous, stable and safe, this too creates a perceptual lens through which you process what’s possible for you. and who you can become in the future. “a” stands for your associations . who you spend time with has an outsized impact on the way you think, feel, and act. your friendship circle, for example, is a strong predictor of your income, lifestyle and lifetime impact. enter relationships with drama queens and chaos kings and you will, over time, be profoundly shaped by these influences. “m” stands for media . each day, no matter where you live, you receive a constant torrent of hypnosis and seduction from many forms of media. these could include advertisements designed to make you buy products, suggestions on what life values are important, and subtle advice on how one should live in order to fit in with the crowd. all of this, over time, infects your self-identity and influences the way you interact with opportunity. penam. these letters explain how you became you. please think about them. discuss them with a pal. and meditate upon them alone. because as you become more aware of the five forces that have shaped you, you grow in your self-mastery. and rise in the ability to make the better choices that are certain to generate more sensational results. oceanofpdf.com the best way to start is to start i’m on the road for a series of presentations to top leaders and heavyweight entrepreneurs as i write you this piece from my hotel room in barcelona. i’m surrounded by the books i’ve brought on this trip (including the prophet by kahlil gibran, the stories of my life by james patterson, the bonfire of the vanities by tom wolfe, the great crashes by linda yueh, jellyfish age backwards by nicklas brendborg, the art of learning by josh waitzkin, and why i write by george orwell; yes, my suitcase is large), my morning journal and a pot of very good coffee. yesterday i completed an intense day of media for the everyday hero manifesto , which was recently released here. tomorrow"
sharma,"i’ll be on a stage in service of six thousand people. i still get scared. because after all these years, i still really, really, really care. earlier, one interviewer asked me a question i often hear after someone has heard a little of my ideology and methodology on leadership, exceptional performance, and making an honestly wealthy life you’ll be proud of at the end: “so where do we begin?” she added: “i also want to write a book and am wondering, where should i start?” my answer was simple: “just start.” it’s really not that hard and there’s no reason to complicate things as you materialize and optimize more of the genius you were born into. the way you start is to start. often, overthinking and hypercomplicating how to get going is a sabotaging symptom of fear. in reality, you’re resisting moving forward because you’re frightened: of success, of failure, of being ridiculed, of standing out from your peer group. how do you start a book? you write the first page. and tomorrow the second one. and the following day the third. then, you keep on going until the darn thing is done. yes, it’s that simple (it’s the execution on the commitment that’s hard). you absolutely must continue following through on the promises you set for yourself. to do anything less will destroy your self-respect and deny the world the magic you are here on earth to make. yes, advance at all costs! through the self-doubt and the feelings the work is bad and all those shimmering attractions to digital diversions. through the seducing desire for it to be easier (the finest things in life always come from the doing of uncomfortable things, right?). how do you start the process of getting fit? you get up early tomorrow morning and do the first few push-ups. then more the next day and even more after that. until doing a ton of push-ups becomes easy. because you’ve built yourself strong. yes, my friend. the way to start is to start. no excuses. zero rationalizations. no postponements. zero complaints. you just exercise your human will to take that first step. and then the next one. and on and on until you eventually become a master at getting the pursuits that are important to you done. and as i wrote in the everyday hero manifesto , “all change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.” so get going! please. your richest life is waiting. and nothing happens until you start. oceanofpdf.com fears are ghost stories so you say you don’t believe in ghosts. really? we all do. … we say we can’t be brave in scary situations, that we’re not prepared enough or trained enough or good enough to accept a superb opportunity. … we sell ourselves on the idea that we are unable to remain relentless when we feel like giving up. … we tell ourselves that it’s too hard to become the people we’ve always wanted to be. … we argue for our weaknesses, obsess around our challenges and then practice our excuses to cover up our insecurities instead of living our greatness. … we delude ourselves into thinking that those who are positive, creative, successful, and soulful are cut from a different cloth. and possess gifts that we don’t have. most of our fears are big lies. pure illusions. blatant untruths. ghost stories. if you get what i mean. the pundit osho told a story about a man who was climbing down from the summit of a soaring mountain. he’d been descending all day and the sun was setting. he carefully chose each step as the sky grew darker and dimmer. suddenly, the climber lost his footing and, terrified that he’d fall thousands of feet into the abyss below, grabbed onto a branch. all night, in staggering fear, the man hung from that branch thinking that if he let go, he’d plunge to his death. all night, he yelped for help. yet no one heard his cries. he thought of all the things he hadn’t yet done in his life, the potential he’d left unused, the growth he’d failed to experience, the human talents he never got to know, and the family he loved so much—all that he’d lose if he fell. then, at sunrise, the early light revealed a truth that startled the climber: just six inches below him was a wide ledge. in the darkness, he had failed to see it. he began to laugh, mildly at first and then uncontrollably. the man realized that his fear was only six inches deep. below that, there was safety. so change your narrative. refuse to listen to the fairy tales that the ghost stories are selling you. they don’t deserve to occupy your mind or limit your success, happiness, and serenity. they really are only six inches deep. oceanofpdf.com stop saying these two bad words … tell someone to read the book that changed your life and they’ll often reply with two words that amount to dirty swearing, in my mind. … recommend that your best friend watch the documentary that taught you how to build the skill that upgraded your artistry and maximized your productivity and they’ll sometimes deploy the same bad words. … suggest to someone you care about that they heal a wound or remedy a flaw or turn their consuming problem into a satisfying solution and they’ll all too often use the same refrain. what are these two words that when used together amount to a symphony of negativity and seriously curb your commitment to personal growth—at least to my ears? “i’ll try.” oh my. oh my. oh my. … “i’ll try” means you won’t commit. … “i’ll try” means you’re not really that invested. … “i’ll try” means you won’t hold yourself accountable. … “i’ll try” means you aren’t seriously that interested. “i’ll try” mostly means you’re worried about making the necessary changes that need to be made to"
sharma,"lead a life you love. and do remember that you cannot have the world you want without doing the things you must, if that makes sense. “i’ll try” is a reason bordering on an evasion offered by the majority to remove themselves from responsibility. this phrase dishonors your talents. and disrespects your genius. “i’ll try” is a violent robber of human potential, a thief of exceptional performance and a stone-cold killer of your biggest natural dreams. “do or do not. there is no try,” advised yoda of star wars fame. i do believe he was correct. oceanofpdf.com be the grown-up in the room the other day, i had a profound conversation with someone who has been my friend for thirty years. she shared that her father had recently passed away and her mother had died just before him, leading her brother to say, “i guess we’re now the grown-ups in the room.” hmmm. “the grown-ups in the room.” i don’t know about you, but although i’m nearly sixty i pretty much feel the same as i did when i was a kid, at least in some ways. strange, right? on the outside, i look older and people guess i know more. and, of course, i have learned a ton and experienced so much life, so far. yet i still am trying to figure out many things. i still get confused by the unfolding of some events, ponder why some souls showed up on my path and wonder if life unfolds according to destiny, or if the whole ride is a random series of situations with no real meaning to them (which i doubt). my friend’s point was profound, for me. be the grown-up in the room. it reminded me that no one other than you will ultimately make your life better. no help is on the way and no savior in shining armor will magically show up to place a silver spoon inside your mouth (and a crown upon your head). no brigade of helpers or cavalry of rescuers is en route to make you into all you have ever wanted to become as a human being and mold your reality into something special, exciting, and fulfilling. this makes me think of a young man i met when i visited a restaurant in cape town on one of my many trips to south africa. he’d spent years in an extremely dangerous gang and then, one day, made the choice to break free. the owner of the restaurant wanted to help, so he gave him a job as a dishwasher. the young man used the chance to move up the ranks, falling in love with cooking in the process. eventually, he became one of the top chefs at the place. oh, and the establishment made it onto the world’s best restaurants list. and was named the best one in africa. i chatted with him at lunch. and asked what moved him to leave his old life. he paused thoughtfully, then replied: “i saw too many of my friends dead. i didn’t want to die. so i had to change. i realized no one’s going to do it for me, so i had to do it for myself.” yes. you really do need to be the one to help you. and assume absolute personal responsibility for the way your life looks (and for making the improvements that will make it richer). because in the room of life, you’re the grown-up now. oceanofpdf.com remember that small steps make giant gains for a few decades, i’ve been sharing a brain tattoo with my coaching clients and speaking audiences that i’ve been told has been enormously helpful to them, so i feel the need to share it with you: small, daily, seemingly insignificant improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results. a truly wealthy life happens more by evolution than by revolution. it’s those constant and small microwins that, when done daily, evolve into a tsunami of victory. which brings me to the great pyramid of giza. recently, i was in cairo. i had a day off and the event organizer generously arranged for a guided tour of this seventh wonder of the world. as we entered the marvelous monument that stands as testimony to human possibility, i learned that the great pyramid took twenty years to build. two and a half million stones were needed, and nearly fifty thousand workers rallied to do the job. for over three thousand years, until the eiffel tower was created in , this spellbinding structure stood as the highest one made by human hands. the real formula that built the marvel? the monument was made by placing one block of stone upon another block of stone and another block upon that block, over and over and over. the focus wasn’t on the pyramid but on the constant act of placing the blocks. the attention was on the process, not the goal. please take a moment to reflect on this point. we inhabit an age when so many of us want our dreams done instantly. too many of us have forgotten the power of patience, the magic of steadiness, and the wonder of tiny triumphs made daily on the project that most inspires us—whether a health program or a love ambition, a financial objective, or a spiritual affair. your days are your life in miniature and as you craft each day, so you create your life. consistency truly is the mother of mastery and the little things you do daily are so much more important than the big things that you might do annually. i guess what i’m also suggesting is that you measure your success not by the achievement of the end result but instead by the depth of your commitment to the journey of making small steps in the direction of your brightest ideals (and by what staying on the path you’ve committed to makes of you as a person). incrementally improving day by day"
sharma,"is winning as far as i’m concerned. the completion of the project is just the icing on the cake. not the real trophy. makes me reflect on the words of scottish novelist robert louis stevenson, who said: “don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant.” sometimes it doesn’t look like your regular but minor acts of moving things forward are creating any progress. yet—trust me—they are. growth is often invisible, like seeds that are germinating underground that some time in the future will turn into towering trees. just stay focused, dedicated, patient and aware that your tiny daily triumphs will eventually compound into remarkably big victories, over the passage of time. oh, and when those around you who don’t get you (or are not really interested in supporting you) criticize or make fun of you, recall the words of prominent author dale carnegie: “any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do.” oceanofpdf.com worship your wounds you’re not broken, you’re just human. you’re not dysfunctional—you’re just alive. if you are willing to get into the game, exercise your native bravery, and take some risks to live your future vision, you’re going to experience pain. the higher the mountain, the greater the danger. it’s not wrong for you to reach for the heavens (and seek to walk with the gods). no—it’s ever so right. it means you’re the hero of your life, that you have courage enough to take some chances and keep the faith in your mighty mission. what’s the alternative? dead person walking. how wonderful that you still believe in you! and rare (in a culture of too many good people who have given up on their childhood hopes, accepted ordinary and are, unfortunately, passing through their best days as cyberzombies glued to white screens). so you’ve been hurt. and yes, you’ve been scarred. i get you. i’ve been there too. yet may i humbly suggest that you celebrate your scars. and worship your wounds. because they have served you beautifully. filling your life with unseen gifts, hidden treasures of wisdom, understanding, resilience, compassion, and greater intimacy with your specialness. life unfolds for your fortune, never for your failure. trust its strange ways. and keep going. blessings you cannot yet fathom are coming. your future is (so) bright. oceanofpdf.com the human who reads the most, wins bable: book accumulation beyond life expectancy. yes. a not-guilty confession: this is my gorgeous affliction. i do buy more books than i’ll ever get to read. and my sense is you are the same. you see, reading a book is having a conversation with the author. and the right conversation could set your life in a completely new direction. all it takes is one new idea to revolutionize your world, right? and if one finds the right book, at the right time, the writer’s stardust rubs off on you. and the hand that eventually puts down the book is a fundamentally different hand. while i was growing up, my father would say, “cut back on buying things. eat less food. yet read more books.” a state leader who attended one of my leadership events in the middle east once told me, “robin, we eat three times a day to be fed. i read three times a day to become wise.” i asked: “when do you read?” he replied: “when don’t i read.” my home? stacked with books. … on creativity … on productivity … on history … on psychology … on business … on economics … on communication … on vitality … on longevity … on character building … on metaphysics the piles of wisdom that surround me comfort me. they make me feel safe in a sometimes cruel yet mostly extraordinary world. they speak to me, of the promise of better days and the glories available to those who aspire. i still seek that one book that completely shatters my limitations, resolves my inner conflicts, and lifts me to new heights of personal mastery and spiritual freedom. and although, given my age, i surely won’t get through all the books i have purchased, i will bequeath (good word, right?) my library to my children. as my legacy. reading daily grows your knowledge base and allows you to transcend hard situations, make fewer mistakes, and predict the future. (especially if you study history; mark twain said, “history doesn’t repeat itself but it often rhymes.”) in a world that wants you to think, do and be like the majority, reading voraciously makes you into someone who thinks for themselves. how much is that worth to you? and each—and every—day while i get to be alive, i run the / reading rule: i read for (at least) forty-five minutes (but usually an hour) and then debrief what i’ve learned in my learning notebook for fifteen, so i understand the concept more deeply and apply it in my life. ideation without execution becomes a delusion. so, fellow bookworm… …in a world consumed by digital invasion and addictive trivial diversion, re-spark your highest love affair with books.

sharma,"first sixty seconds after liftoff than it would consume during its entire voyage around the circumference of the earth? this is because at the beginning, it had to overcome the terrifically strong forces of gravity that wanted to keep it on the ground. so it took a ton of energy and a large degree of work to push the vehicle higher and higher—at that early stage—until “escape velocity” was reached. the forces of gravity had then been transcended. the spacecraft was free. to soar. when it comes to you making the changes that you must make to lead the life you most desire, you’re sort of like that space shuttle. you need to exert a ton of energy and do hard work to overcome your previous ways of operating. to leave behind your gravitational forces (the ones that have restricted your original greatness). so it’s super hard at first. that doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong. it just means the change you’re making is worthwhile, valuable, and rich. everything you now find easy you once found hard, yes? the new habits, skills and behaviors will get easier to implement as the days go by—be sure of this. things always get easier with practice. and because you couldn’t do something yesterday doesn’t mean you can’t get it done today. you’re one day better. and twenty-four hours stronger. oceanofpdf.com expect the best from people (and you’ll mostly get it) i’m mildly embarrassed to share this story, yet i must be honest with you. so here goes. recently, while on the road, i was in a rustic restaurant that i don’t visit often yet always love when i do. it’s in a small swiss town and does exquisite “geschnetzeltes kalbfleisch an rahmsauce mit cognac verfeinert mit rösti,” which simply means veal in a cream sauce with cognac and shredded potatoes. (i’m just trying to impress you with my nonexistent swiss german fluency.) i was with a good friend and we enjoyed a delicious lunch together, talking about films, family, and the future. it was precious. in a straightforward sort of way. at the end, when the bill arrived, and knowing that i had a reservation at the same restaurant for the next day, i asked the owner if it would be possible for me to have a quiet table off to the side when i returned. i wanted to work on the manuscript of this book in a soulful space that enriched my inspiration. she was polite yet slightly curt and explained it would be impossible because “we are full tomorrow and it will be very hard to put you at a table in this room.” i thought that was a little odd. sure, i understood they were full, yet i did have a reservation (made many weeks earlier) and didn’t really understand why she couldn’t find a single space that was quiet and maybe even in a corner, as the room we were in had many corners. and i must admit that for a little while after my friend and i left the restaurant, i felt bad, ruminating over the rejection and concocting stories about her coldness, mild arrogance, and implicit meanness. sorry. but as your mentor from afar, i do need to tell you that that’s just what i did. so the next morning, i woke up early, worked out in the gym on the elliptical machine, had my coffee, wrote in my journal, and reread parts of this book. i then made my way to this special restaurant to enjoy another lunch. this time, alone. as i approached the restaurant, i saw a man standing outside in what appeared to be a leather skirt, a thick fur jacket and the kind of colorful attire a viking would wear. hmmm. interesting. (you know i can’t make this sort of thing up.) as i walked in, i saw that the entire main room was full of fellow vikings—or whatever these good people were dressing up to be. they were laughing loudly, clapping passionately, stomping their feet thunderously, and bellowing speeches at the top of their hoarse voices. i guessed it was some kind of guild meeting or important event to honor the traditional life of the region. the main room was not only packed with the hell-raisers, but they were also enthusiastically drinking unusually large amounts of darkly colored beer. thank god i wasn’t in that room! i would have been the only non-viking in the place and the noisiness would have given me a headache, destroying any chance of me writing anything good over the solo lunch while attempting to enjoy my excellent meal. it gets better. the same woman who had rejected me yesterday politely escorted me past the rowdy vikings and their furry fur coats and dark-colored ale into a very quiet and actually quite romantic little room that i’d never been in. there were flowers on the tables and candles carefully placed over white linen. angels in white capes played harps while doodle puppies danced. (okay, that last line isn’t true. but the room really was utterly fantastic .) it gets even better. the owner of the restaurant then put me into a lovely corner seat. with no one next to me and few people around me. she smiled a huge smile. and warmly welcomed me back. “have a wonderful lunch, you handsome devil,” she said softly. (okay, the “handsome devil” part isn’t true, but the rest absolutely is.) so my perception of being rejected was a hallucination. the truth was that she was trying to protect me from the boisterous vikings. the lesson for us? not everything is about us. stop taking everything personally. most people are incredibly good and profoundly decent. the more we expect the best from others, the more encouragement they’ll receive to show it to us. the german literary icon johann wolfgang von goethe said it far more eloquently than i could in a million years: “if we treat people as if they were"
sharma,"what they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.” and as you do this regularly, you not only help other people to grow, you grow too. which makes you a really wealthy person. very rich, indeed. oceanofpdf.com eat alone fairly often how do you grow braver? easy. you regularly do frightening things. the discomfort of growth is always smaller than the heartbreak of regret. and at the last hour of your final day, it won’t be all the things you did that will bring you sorrow but all the things you didn’t do. all the dreams you didn’t pursue and all the fears you didn’t face and all the opportunities you didn’t seize and all the travels you didn’t take and all the books you didn’t read and all the love you didn’t give. (kindly read this last line twice because it’s really important for you.) a great way to start optimizing your self-confidence and overall fearlessness is to eat alone. today, i’m eating alone in a simple italian restaurant, in the village near the farmhouse as i write this mentoring message to you. in my experience, most people would rather eat at home if they are alone than go to a restaurant and sit alone at a table in a public place, surrounded by others having the time of their lives. or, if we do go out alone, we pull out our phones, scroll through our feeds and watch videos of quirky people doing bizarre dance moves. or celebrities leaving hollywood restaurants in colorful outfits (or causing public scenes) as flashes go off. or influencers hawking the latest beauty product while wearing a face mask. but to just sit there alone is actually a rare thing. without a device. with zero escape routes. in a crowded restaurant. with others nearby laughing and drinking and eating and merrily connecting. to risk being judged as not good enough to be with another human over a meal. to dare to be considered an oddball and weird and eccentric by having the audacity to eat alone. to be willing to be stared at by people who avert their eyes when you catch them looking at you. well, that’s the stuff magic-workers are made of. and yes, my friend, that means you. the way you do one thing creates the way you do everything. to be brave in one area is practice for being brave in every area. and being your bravest self is so key to leading your richest life. real rich. not fake rich. as frank herbert, the author of dune , wrote: i must not fear. fear is the mind killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear. i will permit it to pass over me and through me. and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path. where fear has gone there will be nothing. only i will remain. oceanofpdf.com it’s wise to keep a journal on most mornings of the past twenty-five years of my life i’ve run a morning ritual that has been ever so valuable to my personal growth, increasing creativity, professional learning, and spiritual ascension: writing in a journal. in the everyday hero manifesto , i shared the story of how ten years’ worth of my private journals vanished—yet that’s another story. maybe i’ll share it fully with you if we meet in person sometime in the future. to put it simply, there are six primary reasons why you should embrace the daily routine of journaling: . journaling promotes wise behavior. vague thinking creates vague results. writing in a notebook about your desires, intentions and commitments increases your clarity, and clarity is the dna of mastery. to ask yourself good questions—such as, “what must happen over the coming hours for this to be a day of my life lived well?” or “what three small wins will i accomplish today to make things better than yesterday?”—raises your focus and dramatically improves your willpower to get your goals done. by carefully reflecting on what you wish to create, your performance becomes more concentrated and successful. journaling promotes promise keeping. . journaling increases artistry and captures peak ideas. a genius-grade idea not noted will rarely be remembered. writing down your insights not only deepens your understanding but often stimulates further ones. keeping a notebook is also a superb discipline to help you find excellent solutions to weighty problems you’ve been working on and to record life lessons you’re learning. . journaling encourages you to record your magical moments so you get to live them twice. a beautiful meal or a magnificent sunset or an oceanside walk with one you love, when written about, not only embeds the experience in your mind, body, heart, and soul—it gives you the chance to live it again. imagine the rises in your energy, gratitude, happiness and momentum when you’re regularly re-experiencing your best moments. and training your brain on where you are winning rather than upon the frustrations you may be facing. the pre-eminent positive psychologist sonja lyubomirsky has found through her research that the happiest people are not the ones with the easiest circumstances (only percent of one’s happiness is due to external reality, she has discovered) but the ones with the largest gratefulness. and their appreciation is not random and disordered but “deliberate gratitude.” your journal is an excellent place to list the blessings in your life deliberately and regularly so that the negativity bias of the human brain gets rewired for unbeatable positivity. . journaling is prayer on paper. prayer is a powerful force multiplier in the manifestation of your ideals. every prayer is heard by your higher power and every thanksgiving makes you stronger, wiser, and more tranquil. so write down what you seek and record what you want to see more of in your world. what you focus on really does grow and what you think about expands."
sharma,". journaling gives you a monastery to process through pain, sorrow, and other challenging emotions. during the icy winters of my life—when things felt very severe and quite disappointing—pouring my suffering onto a crisp, blank page was enormously healing. science confirms the same. pain suppressed always comes back to haunt you in unexpected ways. writing about your hurts in a journal allows you a safe space to process through them to a release. because to heal a wound you need to feel the wound. and to let go of a cut you need to do the inner work to clear it. . journaling allows you the gorgeous opportunity to record your colorful life. henry wadsworth longfellow wrote: “a life that is worth writing at all, is worth writing minutely and truthfully.” wise words, right? your life matters and is utterly unique and a thing of immeasurable beauty (in all its highs and lows). so isn’t it worth recording? oceanofpdf.com your hurters are your helpers i’m writing this piece for you in my spartan writing room at the farmhouse. the window is open, early spring air fills the space, and i hear a couple of sheepdogs barking in the distance. a rooster crows far too loudly for my serenity. the olive trees look enchanting and the early morning sunshine illuminates the vineyards off into the distance as i sip a simple cup of espresso (one of the tiny wonders that i adore waking up for). okay. let’s talk about your hurters. those people who played you, misused you, and betrayed you. the ones who broke your trust, stole your kindness, and perhaps even left you a little cynical, critical, and closed. they showed up in your life for a reason, i do believe. you see, the people who cause you pain can actually be the same ones who introduce you to your power. and the suffering they have caused can— if you choose— become a gateway into strengths you didn’t know you had, before the harm was done. neale donald walsch of conversations with god fame wrote a short children’s book that has helped me immeasurably. it’s called the little soul and the sun . short story short, it’s about two souls who meet each other. before becoming human beings. this might seem far out and if it’s weird to you, i totally get it. yet it seems pretty possible to me. just because we don’t believe in something—or understand a novel concept that bends our reality—doesn’t mean it’s untrue, right? anyway. the two souls have a conversation about a promise. the little soul said to the friendly soul that it wanted to know the fullest extent of all its specialness, powerfulness, and wisdom (just like you). and so, the second soul said it would help by doing something bad to the little soul in its lifetime. the friendly soul was asked why it would agree to reduce itself from its natural glory so it could do something hurtful, and it replied, “because i love you.” and so, both souls became human beings. and sure enough, the friendly soul who wanted the little soul to experience its greatness by learning how to love (when it was toughest to love) and to forgive (when it was hardest to forgive) and to be noble (when being decent was demanding) caused deep difficulty to the little soul. and the little soul did exercise its specialness, learning to forgive the other soul for its mean act. because it knew that that soul did so out of love. to help the little soul remember all it truly was. i share this wonderful parable with you because maybe—just maybe—it reflects reality. what if your past isn’t a prison to stay locked in but a school meant to be learned from? what if every single person who has somehow hurt you—by lying to you or betraying you or attacking you or being mean to you—has done this to somehow help you? to push you out of a life of constant comfort and low personal growth into a far richer one where you, by standing in the fires of hardship, discover the great virtues of the best human beings. virtues such as wisdom, tolerance, patience, resilience, persistence, forgiveness, and lovingness. to aid you in becoming the creator, warrior, leader, hero, and truly wealthy human that your destiny only wishes you would be. oceanofpdf.com hang with clowns, expect a circus i’d like us to revisit the point i made in an earlier mentoring session because i want to reinforce it for you. the one about being thoughtful and careful about who you spend time with. because you can handcraft an exceptionally great life or stay with toxic people, but you can’t do both. you become your associations, and your conversations noticeably affect the way you see the world as well as how you show up within it. if you spend your days with victims, disbelievers, and criticizers, their thought viruses and emotional shadows will degrade your brilliance. investing your valuable hours (once spent, they are lost forever) with those who deflate your joy, mock your ambitions, and pollute you with their poison is a sure way to stay stuck, betraying your promise to realize meaningful things, experience genuine beauty, and live with high levels of freedom. so may i please encourage you to do a courageous audit of the people you’ve allowed into your circle and remove (or spend far less time with) the negative ones, while increasing your bonds with those who fuel your faith in opportunity, bravery, and human possibility. because if you hang with clowns, you’d better expect a circus. oceanofpdf.com don’t let self-care ruin your self-worth what i feel the need to share with you now is the importance of not confusing the essential practice of self-care—which is all about protecting your purest mind, healing your good heart, fortifying a healthy body, and nourishing your sovereign spirit, among other things—with the heroic goal of living daringly"
sharma,"and pursuing a creative mission that will increase your self-worth. many people use “inner work” as a way to avoid facing fears and doing the outer work that will make their genius real. look, i’ve been an evangelist for growing a rich interior life for over a quarter of a century. when i first began as an author and speaker, people laughed at me when i spoke of the power of a great morning routine, daily meditation as a means to stay strong and calm, walking in nature to raise positivity and improve creativity, resting more to extend lifespan and building one’s life around a cause. self-care is the foundation of a cheerful, balanced, healthy, and peaceful life. yet sincerely successful people—and this is an important point—never use the wise need for self-care as an excuse from doing the sometimes hard things that also make a human life excellent. they don’t spend all of their finest days in a bathtub perfumed with bath salts, while fresh camomile tea brews and mystical meditation music plays, as someone gives them a foot massage. to be great, you absolutely need to be focused, productive, relentless, and undefeatable in passionately pursuing projects that—though difficult at times—push you to reveal your highest (and most gifted) self. the consistent achieving of seemingly impossible things introduces you to strengths, talents, and powers you didn’t even know you had. and translating your deeply inspired dreams into disciplined daily results leaves a trail of victory that electrifies your self-worth. you’ll love yourself more when you do more of the things that you don’t love doing (but are important to do). and, trust me, you’ll be happier by becoming even more productive. so do both. make good self-care a top priority. an exceptional life is a direct reflection of inner wellbeing. yet balance this with the ongoing building of a base of supreme self-worth, born of elite performance, extraordinary achievement, and the consistent making of outright masterpieces. oceanofpdf.com become a yes person the other day—before i walked on stage to deliver a leadership keynote to nine thousand business leaders in london—i had a great chat with the son of a renowned speaker. he told me that although his father is elderly, he still says yes to everything. everything . yes to speaking events and yes to writing more books and yes to coaching young entrepreneurs. yes to traveling to many different continents and yes to reading new books and yes to fresh challenges and yes to new friendships and yes to trying exciting adventures. i guess that makes him a yes man. and that’s pretty fantastic to me. our tiny planet, going through such tumult, needs more of his kind. people with the wisdom to put down their devices and inhabit the wonders of the present moment. individuals who really do understand that the illusion of safety is always more dangerous than the discomfort of growth. human beings who refuse to live the same year eighty times and call it a life. fear and doubt and disbelief and apathy and mediocrity and cynicism and entitlement keep us small, blocking our native access to excellence, productivity, happiness, and the leadership that is our birthright. so—just maybe—the most powerful word in the world is one of the simplest: “yes.” to increase the first form of wealth, i enthusiastically encourage you to say yes to the risky new project that will push your growth. say yes to the trip you’ve been postponing for years. say yes to giving the speech that spooks the daylights out of you and the new relationship that stretches you emotionally and the book that seems so hard to read you don’t want to read it yet you know you must, as it carries the wisdom your strongest self most wishes you would know. your greatness and your magic depend on this. and your personal honor demands it of you. to say yes, far more often. oceanofpdf.com the nd form of wealth wellness the steadily optimize your health habit good health is not valued until sickness comes. —thomas fuller, english historian oceanofpdf.com the nd form of wealth wellness | quick overview health is a type of wealth. if you don’t feel good physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, all the money, possessions and fame in the world mean nothing. lose your wellness (which i pray you never will) and i promise you that you’ll spend the rest of your days trying to get it back. in one wisdom tradition, it is spoken: “when we are young, we are willing to sacrifice all of our health for the pursuit of wealth and once we are old, we become willing to sacrifice all of our wealth for even one day of good health.” i had a conversation with a great and true friend yesterday. his uncle was a billionaire who recently passed away. softly, my pal spoke about his uncle’s serious illness, and how, near the end, he often told his family that he would have given away his entire fortune to get his once-taken-for-granted wellness back. there is no point hustling and grinding, overworking and not sleeping to reach your personal mount everest, only to end up sick in a sterile hospital room. with tubes down your throat, with needles in your veins, and bound to a bed. i know you know what i mean. and when i write of protecting your top health, i must emphasize that i’m not only referring to your physical realm. to lead your richest life you also need to nourish the health of your mind, guard the wellness of your emotional universe, and regularly and carefully feed your spiritual life. so you consistently feel happy, and profoundly peaceful. for how can one say they are wealthy without a life of positivity, wonder, and soulfulness? oceanofpdf.com take a bath in a forest okay, maybe not literally (although if you want to that’s fine by me). a highly popular practice in japan is shinrin-yoku , which means"
sharma,"“forest bath.” scientific research has confirmed that walking in the woods significantly reduces your blood pressure and any fatigue, anxiety, depression, and cognitive confusion. doing a hike in nature also lowers the stress hormone cortisol and improves your happiness levels. this routine is not only excellent for your mental, physical, and emotional health, it’s terrific for your spiritual vigor. by being close to the earth, grounding among the trees, breathing in fresh air, and getting away from our noisy world, you’ll reconnect with the highest part of you. the one that knows the answers to your deepest questions, has the wisdom to lead you to your best decisions, and is connected to all of life itself. walking in nature is also one of my favorite practices to stimulate creativity. the celebrated english writer virginia woolf would take daily walks. charles darwin, the legendary scientist, took three forty-five-minute walks each day for most of his life. vincent van gogh said, “try to walk as much as you can and keep your love of nature.” i recommend that before you start your workday, you take a fifteen-minute walk near trees, plants, and flowers. this protocol will change the game in terms of your ability to concentrate, the extent of your energy, and your overall productivity. as human beings, we are built to be in nature. and this communion will not only optimize your wellness, it’ll bring far more awe, fascination, and beauty into your life. and wouldn’t that be a healthy thing? oceanofpdf.com know your genes are not your destiny i’m truly fascinated by the field of epigenetics. “epi” means “above” in greek. so epigenetics is simply the study of the factors above and beyond your genetic code that regulate the turning on and turning off of the genes you were born with, if that makes sense. in the past, the common understanding was that the genes you inherited from your parents determined your physical destiny. the “nature versus nurture” debate has been solved and scientific research now confirms that the way human beings develop in terms of our physical and mental health involves both the natural genes we have received from previous generations and environmental factors such as the quality of our thinking, our daily fitness habits, our eating behaviors, and our sleep protocols. yes, your environment and lifestyle choices have a powerful ability to alter the expression of the genes you have inherited. you need not be a victim to your genetics. by installing healthier practices such as early morning exercise, managing stress through regular meditation, or taking the walks in nature (as i mentioned in the last chapter), breathing properly, eating chemical-free and unprocessed food, fasting intermittently, consuming less alcohol, taking at least a day a week away from digital devices, exposing ourselves to cold showers or hot baths, and resting deeply, we can actually turn off genes within our genomes that would have caused us to function poorly or get sick and turn on the ones that will optimize our wellness and lead to a long, disease-free life. so as your caring mentor from afar i suggest that you never give away your power to become the healthiest person you know to excuses around the genetics that earlier generations have passed on to you. and start (or increase) your dedication to constantly executing the habits that i hope will make you live forever. oceanofpdf.com the shortest chapter in the history of health inspiration? few habits will help you as much as moving your body vigorously daily. it’s the elixir for an exceptional life. so as a champion of you becoming your absolute best i must passionately say: if you’re not exercising now, get up and get going! and if you’re already exercising consistently then turn up your enthusiasm. and stretch your physical game. today . life’s just too short not to get really fit. and as mark twain said, “continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection.” oceanofpdf.com see food as medicine “let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food,” instructed the father of medicine, hippocrates. your diet profoundly influences your general wellbeing. blueberries, apples, salmon, and green tea have been proven to promote your happiness, for example. foods such as avocados, brazil nuts, and eggs have been scientifically shown to be strong fatigue-fighters and to deliver the energy for you to be at your best. in a paper published in the lancet , it was reported that poor nutrition was responsible for eleven million deaths globally, within the twelve-month period of the study. a diet high in sodium was the leading risk factor for this mortality. so my gentle yet strong encouragement is that, today, you eat more cleanly, clearly and intentionally. “if it doesn’t hang from a tree, grow in the ground, or have a mother, don’t eat it” is a good adage to follow (unless you’re a vegan). and do remember that you’ll never feel good eating bad food. as strange as it sounds, i also consider water as medicine. as a rule, you should drink four to six glasses of water each day, which will reward you beautifully with numerous health benefits, such as increased blood circulation, enhanced skin vitality and brain functioning, decreased joint pain, a healthier heart, and enriched mitochondrial function, which ensures slower aging and greater longevity. i don’t wish to get into the topic of which diets work best because i don’t really like diets (creating a sustainable lifestyle that includes eating wholesome food is one thousand times smarter), and one size doesn’t fit all. having said this, i need to tell you that one of the best investments i’ve ever made was having my genome analyzed (a quick online search will give you the test providers) because it showed precisely what foods work best for me, given which of my genes were optimal and which ones could be enhanced via the food i eat. i’ll simply encourage you to see food as a category of medicine and to"
sharma,"eat what’s best for you. your mindset, moods, energy, vitality, and vigor will thank you. forever. oceanofpdf.com defend the health of your mind gratefulness really is the antidote to worry. and helpfulness is most certainly a splendid cure for fear. please allow me to explain. first, no section on health could be complete without talking about mental fitness (what’s the point of a healthy body with an unwell mind, right?). protecting your mental condition also elevates your physical life. so let’s drop into a few of my recommendations to keep your psychology at its absolute peak. human beings have a built-in negativity bias. you and i are automatically hardwired to survey our surroundings and actively focus on the threats. this cognitive tendency served us well thousands of years ago when we faced relentless danger in our environments. this evolutionary instinct allowed our ancestors to survive. but now the saber-toothed tigers are gone, the chance of straying from the herd and starving is far less, and the risk of being killed by a member of an unfriendly tribe is generally nearly zero. yet we still suffer from the brain’s drive to look for problems, stay stuck on disappointments, and give a whole lot more importance to the situations in our days that are negative versus positive. … we ruminate on an unpleasant comment made to us (and sometimes remember it for years) and forget about all the praise that we have been blessed to receive. … we concentrate on the irritating traits of a coworker rather than upon their friendly qualities. … we constantly re-live traumatic experiences instead of letting them go, moving on, and enjoying the gifts of the moment. … we are twice as likely to avoid doing something that could enrich our lives massively (due to the fear of losing what we have) than to experience the pleasure of gaining the rewards that the new behavior will bring (read this twice, please). to rewire your negativity bias into a more positive focus, for far greater happiness and mental wellness, i offer you four regular practices: positivity practice #: write a “how could this be worse paragraph.” in your journal, record a few lines describing how the scenario that is bothering you could be dramatically worse. this will shift your thinking from a state of toxicity to one of thankfulness, providing you with a sense of perspective over your problems. positivity practice #: get good at savoring. so many of us are rushing through our lives like we’re running from a five-alarm fire. we fill our calendars to overflowing, obsess with maximizing productivity within every waking hour and neglect what we know are the essentials of a fully lived life to chat online with people we don’t even like. positive psychologists have found that the happiest, healthiest people have a common trait: they make a point of “savoring.” this means that when something good happens they slow down and take it in. actively and consistently make the time to mindfully appreciate and reflect on your blessings, even if these are as simple as a good cup of coffee in the morning, a roof over your head, or a child who loves laughing. positivity practice #: improve your self-talk. most of us would never speak as harshly to others as we speak to ourselves. start being kinder to yourself—giving yourself more praise for good deeds, validation for being true to yourself, and celebration for all you are becoming. you’ve overcome so many challenges, accomplished so many good things, and been a source of encouragement for so many people. talk to yourself in a way that reflects this progress. positivity practice #: be actively helpful. to give of yourself in service of others is to release yourself from worry, negativity, and anxiety. actively and consistently ask yourself, “how may i make the lives of others better?” and then go ahead and take the action. “the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,” advised mahatma gandhi. the more you practice these four central positivity practices, the more you’ll restructure your neural pathways and beat the negativity bias that blocks you from your joy, vitality, and serenity. oceanofpdf.com microdose meditation i’m at a small cottage on a south african vineyard as i write you this mentoring message. i’ve come here for inspiration and seclusion so i can finish this part of the book. country music plays, the sun rises above the mountains in the distance and i am amused by the honest laughter of the workers walking among the ancient vines. let us begin this chapter with a question: what’s the point of having everything society has told you that you should strive to own if, once you have it, you feel completely empty? and are constantly concerned about losing everything you have? i’ve discovered that the key to a great life is to be in the world yet not be attached to it. do your best, then let life do the rest, right? and everything that happens happens for a marvelously good reason—even if in the moment things look bad, yes? human existence is all a game, of sorts. participate in the game because we do live on planet earth so that’s sort of what we’ve signed up for. yet don’t forget that it’s all an illusion in so many ways and that what the majority tells you is important is generally very unimportant. i guess what i’m suggesting is please don’t spend the best days of your life climbing a mountain only to realize when it’s too late that you’ve climbed the wrong one. wasting a life is a tragic mistake. which brings me to meditation. you don’t need to do it every day, although i really think you should do it every day, even if you’re a business titan, a financial trader, a top athlete, or a state leader. actually, if you pursue any of these occupations you must meditate. reminds me of"
sharma,"another of mahatma gandhi’s statements: “i have so much to accomplish today that i must meditate for two hours instead of one.” and even if you’re not in a high-pressure role, i still strongly and lovingly urge you to create a regular meditation practice. it’ll keep you centered and strong amid challenges, thinking optimistically, and feeling profoundly relaxed. so you make your clearest decisions and perform at your best. meditation will also reduce the inflammation that causes disease and will help you live a whole lot longer. and you don’t even have to do it for a long time each session. i adore one-hour or two-hour meditation periods, yet you can microdose it, if you like. if you can’t do sixty minutes, do thirty. and if you can’t do thirty, do ten. and if you can’t do ten, just do five. something is better than nothing. and every session counts . it really, really does. making progress always works better than seeking perfection. steady gains all work together to get you closer to a life of constant contentment and lasting inner freedom. oceanofpdf.com practice the naked sunbathing rule okay, maybe you don’t need to be naked (unless you like to be, and that’s fine with me). the point i’m encouraging you to consider today, as you work on building the second form of wealth, is the dazzling value of spending time in the sunshine (not too much because that’s bad but a reasonable amount of time because that’s good). each and every day. or whenever it’s sunny. moderate (ten to twenty minutes) sun exposure increases your serotonin levels, which increases your happiness levels. this amount of sunbathing has also been reported to raise vitamin d measures by , iu. some research even suggests that a short period in the sun between am and noon helps with weight loss. oh, and morning sunbathing—again, in moderation—allows sunlight into your eyes, which increases your mental focus, overall daytime alertness and the depth of your sleep. and get this: the journal of internal medicine reported a study involving thirty thousand swedes that found that those who spent a small time in the sun daily lived between six months to two years longer than those who did not. now, of course, too much exposure to the uv rays of sunshine is carcinogenic. you know that. yet a little more time sunbathing just might be the habit that grows your positivity, enriches your tranquility, and extends your richest life. oceanofpdf.com a sweaty workout is never a silly idea i woke up this morning and did not feel like working out. my mind came up with a litany of excellent excuses: “a rest day would be good today” (i didn’t need a rest day because i had one a few days earlier) and “i’m an artist so why not enjoy the moment?” and “i’ll work twice as hard in the gym tomorrow.” yet i reached into the vast reservoir of willpower that we all have within us (it’s like a muscle that grows stronger with use) and pushed myself to go to the gym. excuses are liars and procrastination is a thief. and i remembered what boxing legend muhammad ali taught me when he said: “i hated every minute of training but i said, ‘don’t quit. suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.’ ” and guess what? the workout got easier the more i got moving. yes. i turned up the music (it was “anthem” by greta van fleet) and picked up the pace (i was running). the more i sweated the happier i felt. the longer i ran the more energy i had. once i was done, i felt absolutely fantastic . the decision to do what i was resisting completely changed the texture, vibe and energy of my entire day. my lesson for you here, my friend? easy. though you may wake up thinking that exercising today is a bad idea, by the time you do it, i’d be willing to bet my trusted and muddy mountain bike that you realize it was a very good one. because you’ll always feel so much better after a spirited workout than you did before you started it. oceanofpdf.com do a -day zero-sugar challenge when i mentor a billionaire or advise a start-up entrepreneur or counsel a famous actor, i’ll often put them on a series of thirty-day challenges. this practice works extremely well. … if the goal is to get fit, it might be thirty days of walking ten thousand steps each morning. … if the focus is greater positivity and more mental toughness, this may mean thirty full days of going without any complaining. … if the objective is a far higher quality of work, the challenge could involve thirty days of going dark from social media or traveling to a seaside retreat to get their magnum opus done. you get my drift. and the concept really does work incredibly well (especially if you keep a daily log or use an online habit tracker). if you miss a day that’s okay, don’t beat yourself up. get back on the horse tomorrow. which oddly brings me to sugar. it’s completely poison, you know? it can lead to a leaky gut, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart problems. it can promote cancer, create brain disturbances, and increase metabolic disorders. get it out of your life and your physical wellness, mental focus, energy levels, and longevity will soar. yes, for thirty days avoid sugar. the first few days will be a struggle as your sugar tooth screams for ice cream or candy or chocolate or sodas, but then your body will adapt, your cravings will be for more natural food, and you’ll start feeling really, really, really great. remember that all change is hard at first, messy in the middle, and gorgeous at the end. and that nothing tastes as good as top health feels. oceanofpdf.com commit to a dopamine detox one of the"
sharma,"best moves you’ll ever make to get the wealth of your wellness to a whole new level is to free yourself of the all-too-common relentless craving for dopamine. the very design of social media apps is built around raising the release of this neuroregulator, which makes you feel driven and delighted. each time you see likes on a post you’ve created, your brain’s reward center is activated, which then causes the release of more dopamine. likewise, watching television shows full of action, keeping a hectic schedule, eating sweet treats and engaging in other escapes such as over-texting, endless online scrolling, compulsive clothes buying, and consuming alcohol breed a dopamine feedback loop. doing these things gives you instant sensations of pleasure, which in turn releases dopamine in your brain, which in turn motivates more of this pleasure-seeking (yet often toxic) behavior. here’s the key piece of information to know: as you produce more dopamine, you begin to need more dopamine for the same high. this leads not only to a dopamine deficit but also to the psychological phenomenon of hedonic adaptation where you do all the things that once made you happy, yet you now feel apathy. you begin to feel jaded and notice that few things in life give you feelings of joy anymore, which pushes you to pursue even more stimulation with the hope of feeling more alive. what a mess! the solution? do a “dopamine detox.” yours could be five or even ten days long and include: … no device checking during the first two hours after you wake up … full social media fasting … avoidance of tv, video games, and even music for the detox period … eating simple, lighter foods at home instead of heavy foods in a restaurant … being in solitude, silence, and stillness for a few hours each day … no alcohol or other addictive mood enhancers during the time of the program doing this will recalibrate your dopamine production, prevent the hijack of your brain’s reward system, and allow you to break bad habits such as endlessly watching social media feeds or seeking silly videos, and filling every waking hour with “hustling and grinding” just so you have even a little bit more of feeling good. i guess what i’m also suggesting is that you slow your life down and simplify your days. do less to live more. this makes me think of what henry david thoreau wrote in his wonderful book walden : i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if i could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when i came to die, discover that i had not lived. oceanofpdf.com become a professional sleeper to feel more wonderful and become a whole lot healthier, sleep much more. last night, i slept ten hours! this isn’t my normal routine, yet oh me oh my do i feel fantastic today! tons of reputable science is telling you, me, and the rest of the good souls walking the planet today that sleep deprivation is the number one way to cut your lifespan short. although i’ve been encouraging people to rise before dawn for ages (many millions of people have read the am club , installed the // formula for a world-class morning routine, and dramatically upgraded their lives by it), i haven’t said that this should be done at the expense of rest. not at all. sleep is not a luxury but a necessity. (could you please read that line five more times and then tattoo it onto your brain and etch it deeply into your heart?) because good rest lies at the bedrock of a gorgeous life. research confirms that when we sleep, a mechanism is invoked that washes the brain. proper sleep rinses the brain of toxins, repairs brain cells damaged by stress, and allows for memories to be assembled then integrated in the most efficient way possible. good rest also grows your creativity, advances your productivity (via refueling your energy), and even ensures you’re emotionally steady (by managing the amygdala—the part of the brain that releases stress hormones in response to a threat—and reducing limbic hijack). ever notice how easy it is to overreact and make the bad choices that cause big problems when you’ve had a night of poor sleep? i’d almost go out on a limb and say the majority of our mistakes are made when we are tired. a splendid night of sleep restores perspective and just makes everything better. i invite you to build a smart sleep habit stack, so you can calibrate your rest to the highest grade possible. it could include: … doing a long walk after you finish work so that by the time you get to bed you are so tired that you sleep like a baby. … no digital device checking after pm so you avoid the white screen exposure that affects melatonin production. (melatonin is necessary for life-affirming recovery via sleep.) … a pre-sleep routine that includes quietly writing about the little wins of your day, noting lessons learned along with even the smallest of joyful moments, relaxing in a hot bath with soothing music, and avoiding notifications, the news and anything anxiety-inducing and overstimulating. … cleaning up all messes in your home spaces and setting out your exercise clothes and running shoes the night before an early morning workout (put those right by your bed) so you have zero reasons to procrastinate when you wake up. … resting in a cool bedroom free of technology and disturbances (use a white noise machine to block out irritating sounds if you live in a busy city). “sleep is god. go worship,” instructed author jim butcher. words of wisdom. oceanofpdf.com show up in the gym the way you wish to show up in life it’s a rainy day back at the farmhouse. the windows are super old, so a little rain has seeped in,"
sharma,"drizzling onto my beloved writing table. that’s all right, though. it’ll just give it more character. my teaching within this chapter is straightforward: your gym routine is your life practice . the way you show up in the fitness studio determines the way you’ll operate in all other areas of your life (because the way you do one thing really is preparation for the way you’ll do everything). so use your workout to set up a way of being that also serves your life well. when i see a super-fit person, it tells me clearly that they have five key characteristics that not only serve their physical wellness but contribute to their lives as a whole: focus . as you work out, you’re actually training your focus. use it as a meditation of sorts, keeping your thinking on what you’re doing, fully immersed in the present moment. if your mind wanders, bring it back to the now. the more you practice this, the better you’ll be able to pay attention while you do any activity outside of the gym. and stay concentrated on the activities that count versus being endlessly distracted. dedication . the best workouts are the ones you didn’t feel like doing but did—and ended up loving. consistently doing the hard things you don’t feel like doing (yet know you should do because they are so darn good for you) really is how heroes are made. so keep your self-promises and do the exercises you told yourself you would do. every workout contributes to reaching your highest health goal. as you operate like this regularly, you’ll notice that you’ll have all-new levels of dedication and consistency that you can use to win in other areas of your life. excellence . yes—this means doing the run in precise form. performing the yoga posture with grace, skill, and calibration. lifting the barbell with exceptionalism. doing the sprinting nearly perfectly. excellence in the gym is preparation for excellence at life. and ensures the making of a habit architecture within you that makes mediocrity far less likely after you’ve left the health club. persistence . i must confess to you that yesterday was one of those days in the gym where nothing really worked for me. the burpees were exhausting, the push-ups were disappointing and i felt like quitting. yet i am not a weakling. i do not quit. i know that i am most alive and true to myself when i continue at the times i feel like stopping. so i pressed on. of course, you can do this too. and when you do, you’ll become so much more relentless in all dimensions of your life. improvement . all professional athletes are far more obsessed with the ongoing making of progress than with having the ring on their pinky finger (because they get that this is exactly how they got the ring). i watched an interview with the late nba legend kobe bryant where he spoke of staying present to the process and finding joy in each and every practice session. he sounded almost like a zen monk, preaching the benefits of living in the moment versus consistently thinking about the end result (the championship). he added that by learning to love each practice, he could do more of them than anyone else in the league: one early in the morning then another later in the morning, then another in the afternoon and yet another in the evening. with a broad smile, he concluded that by running this practice template day after day, then month after month and year after year, he increasingly built the skill and the prowess that caused him to have such a major advantage that no one else in the game could keep up with him. ever. so definitely do show up fully and completely when you enter your gym. because that will set up exactly how you roll through a life filled with true wealth. oceanofpdf.com become a skilled lifetime multiplier i heard a broadcaster criticizing “biohackers” and another commentator mocking the services of a european longevity clinic tucked away in the alps. both people said that aging is a natural and inevitable situation that humans must accept—and never play with. really? makes me think of the naysayers who questioned the validity of galileo’s thesis that the earth was round or the closed-minded cynics who said cars would never replace horses and buggies. the hard science is clear: aging can be slowed by thinking, eating, and doing the right things. and some highly regarded physicians have even confirmed that aging can actually be reversed . ray kurzweil, the eminent inventor and futurist, said it smartly: “live long enough so you can live forever.” the advances in medicine and innovations for longevity coming down the pipeline will delight—and stun—you. my wish for you in today’s mentoring session is to get seriously invested in adding a few extra decades to your lifetime. just imagine (close your eyes and do this for even a moment) adding twenty or thirty or forty or fifty (or more) extra years to your life by adopting lifestyle habits ranging from the sensible use of some of the revolutionary supplements available to cold plunges and ice baths, hot saunas, intermittent fasting, appropriate amounts of sunshine, an eating plan that works well for your genome, and regular meditation, along with lots of time in nature and plenty of good naps. by multiplying your lifespan exponentially, you’ll benefit mightily from the magic power of compounding, not only within your valuable financial life but in other areas as well: … with an extra twenty years of life (for example) to study, practice and escalate your craft, just imagine how exceptionally superb you’ll be in your profession. … with an extra thirty years with your family and friends, please consider how many more adventures you’ll have with your loved ones, the rich experiences you’ll enjoy and the goodness you can shower on them. … with an extra forty"
sharma,"years added onto your lifespan, happily reflect on all the triumphs you can win, books you can read, travels you can take, new languages you can learn, and personal growth you will most certainly achieve. … with an extra fifty more years, consider all the people you’ll help, all the kindness you can show, and the magnificent impact you’ll create. get great at multiplying the length of your life and injecting more of the extraordinary into your days. as always, start with tiny steps. do them with consistency, and when you feel like stopping keep on walking. it’s a statement of truth that we overestimate how much progress we can make in a month yet underestimate how far we can get in half a year. okay. superchum, my little dog, wants me to walk her. so i need to go. let’s talk later. bye. oceanofpdf.com go omad weekly challenging message here. we now know that caloric restriction is good for our health and extends our lifespan. read about autophagy —it’ll be well worth ten minutes out of your precious life. may i gently suggest that you fast at least once a week. yes, once a week go omad: one meal a day. even better, take the food you would have eaten on that day and give it to a homeless person or local food bank. this way, you elevate two lives. reminds me of what hermann hesse wrote in siddhartha , one of my favorite books: “everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach their goals if they are able to think, if they are able to wait, if they are able to fast.” intermittent fasting creates low-dose stress on the body, which pushes your body out of its normal state and activates what’s known as hormesis , a phenomenon where an array of cellular processes are kickstarted that reduce inflammation, repair cellular damage, increase resilience and fight the oxidative stress, that advances aging. i usually fast two or three days a week (yet i’m not religious about this; if my body tells me it really needs to be fed, i feed it). the discipline has been life changing for my mental clarity, self-discipline, creativity, energy levels, and sensations of youthfulness. in ancient times, the romans, egyptians, and greeks used fasting to detox the body, purify their emotional lives, strengthen their fortitude, and increase their spiritual power. experiencing temporary hunger will also serve to raise your empathy for those in our world with empty bellies and move you to do more for those in need. so if you haven’t tested this habit out, try it. it’ll be hard at first. and gorgeous as it becomes your new normal. oceanofpdf.com laugh more to live longer “we don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing,” noted irish playwright george bernard shaw. pure wisdom, isn’t it? our world is complex, full of very real concerns and a growing array of crises. i don’t want to list them as, honestly, that would hurt my heart. anyway, one of the smartest things you can do in this confusing age is to remember the words of my great and late friend richard carlson: “don’t sweat the small stuff—and it’s all small stuff.” look, my steadily growing and absolutely special friend, i’m not saying that the issues our civilization is now dealing with are small. not at all. yet life is for the living. and—even if you’re granted a long life you’ll be deep under the ground, pushing up daisies, before you know it. sorry to say it, yet connecting with your mortality every once in a while puts more vitality into your days. because you become more conscious that they are limited. a brilliant way to stay lighthearted in these polycrisis times is to keep your perspective. when i face a problem, i often ask myself, “has anyone died here?” if not, i move ahead quickly and cheerfully. i also ask myself, “will this matter in a year?” and even “what’s the opportunity here?” then, as strange as it sounds, i force myself to laugh. i really do. sometimes it’s in the mirror and other times it’s in the woods. did you know the very act of smiling causes a cascade of neurotransmitters such as oxytocin and serotonin to be released in your brain, as well as the production of the neurotransmitter modulator brain-derived neurotropic factor (bdnf), which is a key factor in the neuroplasticity of your brain, especially for peak learning? and are you aware that laughter has been shown to reduce stress, raise your mental wellness, reduce chronic pain, improve heart health, and generate stronger immunity? laughter therapy has deep roots. in the s, a professor of surgery named henri de mondeville would use humor as a tool in postoperative treatment of his patients. i smiled when i first read this. because it’s so interesting. in , norman cousins—a journalist—was diagnosed with a serious medical disorder. he wrote an article in the new england journal of medicine called “anatomy of an illness,” where he reported that his recovery from degenerative collagen illness came from taking high doses of vitamin c and laughing consistently. “i made the joyous discovery that minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep.” to force the laughter amid his hardship, he’d watch marx brothers movies and candid camera re-runs and ask his nurses to read funny articles to him. near the end his life, cousins noted: “it is quite possible that this treatment was a demonstration of the placebo effect. but if so, the placebo—‘the doctor who resides within’—was a powerful one.” last thing. according to one study, the average four-year-old laughs four hundred times a day while the average adult laughs fifteen times. comedian steve martin would laugh for a few minutes in the mirror each morning to put himself in a positive mood. just maybe, you should too. oceanofpdf.com breathe like"
sharma,"a samurai get this: centuries ago in japan, samurai warriors tested their readiness to go into battle by having a feather placed under their nose. if the feather didn’t move, they were allowed to fight. the calm breathing showed they were in a high state of focus, confidence and courage. “to breathe properly is to live properly,” taught the-greatest-of-all-time sages (yes, they were goats). so many of us have forgotten how to breathe correctly, pushed by the obligations and stresses of everyday life to inhale and exhale quickly and shallowly instead of deeply, from the belly. and, via a negative feedback loop, shallow breathing sets off the sympathetic nervous system (that part of your nervous system related to the “fight, flight or freeze” response in situations of strain), generating even more stress and worry. breathing deeply (sometimes called diaphragmatic breathing) not only relaxes you in challenging moments and boosts mental and emotional wellness, it also optimizes your attention span (in an environment of relentless digital distraction). the strong samurai used breathwork as a method to lead rich, rewarding and mostly noble lives. let us learn from them. oceanofpdf.com chant like a monk i am fascinated by monks and monasteries and the mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual superpowers the finest ones develop through their time-tested rituals, which range from meditation and prayer to fasting and chanting. i wrote the monk who sold his ferrari decades ago and yet, even before that, i was trying to figure out how these supreme souls were able to do the amazing things they do (some monks have trained themselves to raise their body temperatures at will, endure extreme amounts of pain and go on water fasts for many weeks). one of my top fascinations with these rare-air beings is their daily practice of chanting at am and how they use this routine not only to ensure their health is ideal but also to guarantee that their spiritual lives are strong. science is starting to catch up with the monks and evidence is emerging that sound therapy and mantra meditation (where a word or phrase is recited repeatedly) tone the vagus nerve, which is central to stress resilience and continuous happiness. as part of my morning practice, as the first rays of dawn present themselves, i’ll often say a mantra (the “man” is sanskrit for “mind” and the “tra” is sanskrit for “freedom,” so mantras free the mind) to set my day off on an excellent start. my favorite slogans include: … “every day and in every way i’m getting stronger and stronger, healthier and happier, and kinder and kinder.” (this mantra is derived from one made famous by french physician émile coué in his book self-mastery through conscious autosuggestion .) … “this day is a gift and i am living it beautifully, using it carefully and making steady progress confidently.” … “i am accomplishing hard projects easily and joyfully, and continuously growing in energy, mastery, and bravery.” … “to be of use, to help those in need, to do good things for as many people as i can is to live my life fully.” hope these help! remember, you’re stronger than you know, you’re more talented than you’re giving yourself credit for and your future has deep magic in store for you. trust yourself, believe in you (especially when no one else does) and keep moving ahead. always. oceanofpdf.com see solitude as a wellness method we are taught from a young age to be in the company of others most of the time. those who are alone a lot are condemned as hermits and chastised as outsiders. stay in the herd. make sure you fit in. think like everyone else. don’t dare stand out, we are schooled to think. in so doing, we have become so separated from our most well, wise, creative, true, and peaceful selves that we don’t even know what we’re missing. we don’t know what we don’t know. and in the rare moment that we do find ourselves in any form of solitude, we quickly reach for our drugs of choice, ranging from tech gadgets, blaring news feeds and loud music to superficial online chatting, digital dating, doom surfing, and overworking just to avoid our natural state. of being. yet we are most alive in the presence of ourselves. and your relationship with you really does determine your relationship with others. you cannot be comfortable in society if you are deeply uncomfortable alone. practice what i call in my mentoring methodology the s focus. concentrate often on being in silence, seeking stillness (in this era of hyperactivity), and enjoying the extraordinary gifts of solitude. this trinity of states will absolutely elevate your daily experience of a wellness that knows no bounds. and the wealth money cannot buy. “i find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. to be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. i love to be alone. i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude,” wrote henry david thoreau, one of my all-time-favorite philosophers. and poet may sarton observed that: “loneliness is the poverty of self; solitude is richness of self.” good, right? oceanofpdf.com supersize your gratefulness as i write you this message, i’m in another part of the world where there is, sadly, much poverty. earlier this morning i had a conversation with a man who works in the gym. i asked him how he was doing and he replied with an enormous smile (nearly the size of the great pyramid of giza that we discussed in an earlier mentoring conversation) and an enthusiastic “very fine.” then i dug deeper. he explained that he lived in “a zinc house”—that is, a small shack made of metal siding. to wash himself he’d go to a public area for water from a tap and then heat it on an old stove and bathe from a broken bucket. he had no toilet, few possessions and not much food. to"

because i’m taking my terrific daughter to dinner. no other family member, none of my friends at the table with us, not the tiny dog—just a father and his daughter. talking about her tennis game, my recent travels, her upcoming trip to india and our latest excitements. for this, i express immense gratefulness. on her last trip to india, my second-born brought me back a gift that she had carefully wrapped and tied with a basic yet exquisite red thread. she gave me a massive grin as she handed it to me. “here, dad. i brought this all the way home, for you. i hope you like it.” i really did. and i still do. i keep that small hand-carved wooden elephant in my writing room so i see it pretty much every day. i need to tell you that it’s worth more than any ferrari (not that i’ve ever had one), speedboat (not that i want one) or tailored suit (not that i’d wear one) could ever mean to me. because my daughter gave it to me. you now know that positive psychologists use the term “deliberate gratitude” for the type of gratitude expressed by the most mentally healthy, physically hardy, emotionally happy, and spiritually strong people on the planet. it’s not the once-a-year on new year’s day kind of gratitude but appreciation as a considered, intentional, and regular practice. the great thing about making deliberate gratitude a part of your days is that it’s free. and it’s easy. just start making a little time to be thankful for the blessings in your life. and push yourself to pay greater attention to the things that you usually take for granted. if you have eyesight, food on the table, work that helps you fulfill your responsibilities, and two feet to walk on, celebrate these gifts. you’d miss these presents if you lost them. i’m asking you to supersize your gratefulness—beginning right now. the more you do it, the better you’ll get at it (like all skills that you practice). in time, you’ll earn your masters in astounding gratitude and a doctorate in daily delight, sensing the subtle preciousness of everything (even the hard things) that fills your world. this honestly is my prayer for you. oceanofpdf.com consider that cold showers decrease doctors good science is confirming that “cold immersion” habits such as ice baths, swimming in a freezing lake, and frigid showers can lead to more positive moods, enhanced cognitive function and immune response, quicker recovery times after exercise, and even better cardiovascular health. in one study published in the european journal of psychology , it was confirmed that putting yourself in °c (°f) water increased dopamine (remember it’s the feel-good neuroregulator that enhances focus and motivation) by percent! i need to be clear that i’m not providing any medical advice (anywhere in this book), yet research is also showing that a relatively quick cold shower has some wonderful health benefits ranging from better brain health (by the release of cold shock proteins, which protect against neuronal loss) to extended longevity (frigid water activates the proteasome to increase lifespan). why does it work? the answer can be found in the word i offered to you a little earlier: “hormesis.” recall this is the phenomenon where, in response to a stressful challenge on the body, a series of cellular responses are activated that serve to build strength, health, longevity, and resilience. done in appropriate amounts, hermetic stressors such as cold temperature (or intermittent fasting, or high-intensity interval exercise) push the body to adapt, which in turn causes the formation of new mitochondria, increases removal of toxins in your system, improves blood sugar regulation, and promotes what elissa epel, director of the aging, metabolism and emotion center at the university of california, san francisco, describes as “cellular housecleaning activities that slow aging.” so take more cold showers. you just might need to visit fewer doctors. oceanofpdf.com exercise your spiritual wellness i’m so happy that our culture is moving forward in the understanding that peak human health is"

the concept of “spiritual wellness” would seem less mysterious and mystical to most people. in my work with successful financiers, celebrity entrepreneurs, and iconic athletes, one of the learning models we start with is the interior empires framework, which shows that world-class and highly satisfying health requires you to exercise and optimize in four important areas: mindset (your psychology), heartset (your emotionality), healthset (your physicality), and soulset (your spirituality). without dedication to improvement in each of these realms of wellness you will never, ever be able to lead your richest and most beautiful life. soulset has nothing to do with religion. not at all. soulset training simply involves deepening your connection with your wisest self—that part of you that knows what is right for you, that stands strong and graceful in periods of trouble. that part of you that understands that to not realize your natural gifts and talents is to diminish the world (because we miss out on what your genius would produce). that part of you that is a giver versus a taker. and a hero, not a victim. to refuel your spirit, please do make the time to be alone more often. carve out time to sit in quietude at least a few times weekly and ideally for a profound period daily. walk in the woods to renew your highest—and finest—self. pray if you want to, read from the wisdom literature if you’d like to and remember to never leave the site of someone in need without doing what you can to ease their pain, in any possible way. the more people you help the more your soul will expand. we’re now at the end of the section on the second form of wealth, but i very much wish to encourage you not to neglect your spiritual life in your pursuit of top health. a

bernard shaw oceanofpdf.com the rd form of wealth family | quick overview to have the love of a good (yet never perfect) family is one of life’s sweetest rewards and a currency that is exponentially more valuable than any amount of money. you can’t call yourself really rich if you end up financially wealthy but suffer from poverty of human connections with the most important people in your universe. a strong, joy-filled, and happy family life is a basic building block and fundamental foundation of a personal story that will not only satisfy you completely but also contain the creativity, productivity, and impact on others that the most powerful part of you seeks. to know the caring of those who love you and to savor the companionship of good friends and well-wishers is a trophy of a genuine victory. interestingly, too many good souls among us take their family lives for granted—until a loss happens. and only then does the vast treasure of a top home life come into sharper focus. “love knows not its depth until the moment of parting,” said the lebanese poet kahlil gibran in his masterwork, the prophet . investing in your closest relationships and enriching the hours of your days with higher love is one of the smartest and highest-yielding investments you’ll ever make. so let’s get going in our work together on this third—and essential—form of wealth: family. oceanofpdf.com that time my mother took on a motorcycle gang i’m not making this up: a motorcycle gang moved onto the street my parents lived on for decades. they rented a neighbor’s house and would race up the street on their rides, shaking the windows of the homes on the once-peaceful, treelined suburban road in the process. my mother—fearless as usual (she’s in her eighties now)—went out and purchased a set of neon orange cones (like the ones that highway construction workers use) and carefully set them up to slow the bikers down. she did not do this for her own benefit. she did it because my children—who were very young at the time—often played on the street in front of my mom and dad’s house. and she needed to protect them (way to go, mama bear!). the strategy worked—barely. the gang slowed their pace. yet they still drove their motorcycles a little too quickly for my mother’s liking. one day, while the bikers were relaxing on their bikes outside their residence, listening to mozart’s jupiter symphony (okay, that part’s not true, but all the rest is), mom told a neighbor that she was going over. “i’m going to have a talk with them so they slow down for my grandkids,” she said. “i don’t want anything to happen to the children.” “please, no, don’t go,” begged the neighbor. “they’re dangerous.” “i’m going,” replied mama bear. and, indeed, she went over. she asked them to slow down and be more careful. and to be better neighbors. the result of her bold move? they couldn’t have been more polite. gracious, actually. this fierce and tough-looking motorcycle gang had hearts of gold. the leader said—this brings tears to my eyes as i write it—“ma’am, your granddaughter is our granddaughter. we’ll be very careful. thank you.” mom went home. she baked a gigantic batch of chocolate chip cookies. and walked them over to the crew. seriously, she baked the bikers fresh cookies. the leader told them that if she ever needed any help, the gang was there for her. she left with a smile. while they ate their cookies, sitting on their bikes in their driveway. the point of the story? easy. few things are more important to a truly rich life than family and good neighbors. keep yours close. oceanofpdf.com create a love account"

(i make it a ritual to hug my children whenever i see them and whenever they leave me. who knows what can happen tomorrow.) those tiny, daily deposits into the love account will give you far more happiness than a safe full of jewels. and ensure that your self-worth is always higher than your net worth (although, of course, financial freedom is important to your best life and i’m definitely getting to some transformational tools for how to make this real in an upcoming section that you’re going to find extremely helpful). as ralph waldo emerson said so eloquently, “without the rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar.” oceanofpdf.com live the loved ones’ eyeballs law here’s a top law to live if you want to have super-rich relationships with your intimate partner, family at large, and truest friends: if something is important to them, make it important to you . in other words, get behind the eyeballs of that person you love. try to see the world as they do and sense how their heart is feeling on whatever issue, activity or excitement they are sharing with you. this idea is about so much more than general empathy. it’s about significantly amplifying the importance you give to something that you might usually dismiss—because the human being that you care about so much thinks and feels it’s significant. and once you get really good at living this law, carry it out into your greater community. live like this and your life will become a gift. and a beautiful example (to many). oceanofpdf.com savor the small surprises of family life i know this is a common idea, yet it means so much to me that i thought i’d write a short mentoring message for you on it. let’s start with my mother again. we had a big family dinner last night and—as always—mom asked, “what can i bring?” as usual i replied, “nothing, mamma—just bring you (and dad). everything is all handled.” when mamma showed up, looking beautiful and elegant as always, she was clutching a little bag with something in it. “here, robin, this is for you. it’s fresh mint for your morning tea. i picked it up this afternoon from the market. you’ll love it.” in life, it’s so easy to get caught up chasing what our society tells us are the grand prizes, only to find out too late that they very much were the insignificant ones. and in life, we often forget that the seemingly small things, like my beloved mother’s mint bought from a farmer’s market with deep love for her son, are really the big things. oceanofpdf.com don’t carry grudges life’s too short to carry a grudge. i recall reading rolling stones guitarist keith richards’ autobiography, life , which included a story about a time when one of his close friends stole money from him. rather than casting the man out of his life and being bitter about it for years, the musician forgave him, thinking the friend likely needed the cash more than he did. and then he went back to his studio, to make more music. ninja-like, right? zen-master-level behavior, to me at least. such an honorable, heroic, and loving reply to the foibles of another human being. some people might have a completely different philosophy. “teach them a lesson” and “no one’s going to do that to me” and “they need to pay” kind of stuff. i get it. sometimes i think like that too, i do confess. a client recently told me that his father, sadly, was dying of stomach cancer. had about a month left to live. the father had not spoken to his brother for fifty years. he said they had a huge fight when they were both much younger. get this—the father couldn’t even remember what the fight was about! but positions had hardened. walls were cemented. the battle lines drawn. and so, for half a century , the two brothers, once incredibly close, didn’t say even a word to each other. not one word. … think of all the fishing trips together they lost. … think of all the family meals they failed to share. … think of the laughter they didn’t enjoy, the memories they didn’t make and all the brotherly love they threw away. my client said that last week the brother showed up at his father’s hospital room. he just strolled in. with a card, some flowers, and a box of chocolates (wrapped carefully with a big blue bow). the sick man said, “i’m so angry at you. for us losing all those years together.” he then relaxed and coughed and began to cry. the brother wept too, as he said, “i’ve really missed you.” he paused, wiped away the tears and then whispered in the ear of his brother, “i love you.” my client’s father passed away the next day. let us not carry any grudges. nothing good ever comes from them. oceanofpdf.com practice tough love relationships are not meant to be relentlessly"

look, like i suggested in the last message, all romantic relationships can be challenging during certain periods. the chances are low that on the first or second or third one, you’ll find the person who is ideal for you. as you search, please be sure to look for a partner, not a project. i believe this is an incredibly important point for everyone to remember as they choose their mates. and yes, i do agree and acknowledge that no one is perfect. i sure am not. i’ve yet to meet someone with none of the flaws, scars, and strangeness that make us human. but i do believe that the right partner is out there for each one of us. as chef julia child once said, “the secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. you know they’re right if you love to be with them all the time.” that’s what i now have. and i hope the same for you (if you don’t have this yet). oh, and once you find that person who you know is your person, fight to keep them when times get rough (they will). amazing life partners don’t grow on trees. and legendary love stories need plenty of patience. oceanofpdf.com practice the great friends rule my beloved father—who devoted fifty-four years of his life to being a community doctor—once told me, “robin, if you have three great friends, you’re a rich man. keep your old friends close. they are great treasures—and hard to find.” to have three friends who accept you, encourage you, and love you for who you are (quirks and all) is a special gift of a life wisely lived. … friends who you can be yourself around rather than needing to pretend to be someone you’re not, in order to fit in. … friends who laugh with you when you laugh, and cry with you in sorrow. … friends who get you and applaud your visions (no matter how silly they sound). … friends who you could call at am from a foreign country if you’re in trouble, knowing they’d rush to the airport and board the first flight to come get you. “good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life,” noted mark twain. i am certain he is right. oceanofpdf.com record the ride i wrote about the main idea of this particular message ages ago in who will cry when you die?

(it makes me think of the popular line “sometimes people come back into our lives to see if we are still stupid.”) it just means the love you shared was real and important and always to be treasured (in a secret place within your heart). and that you’re so strong and forgiving that rather than being bitter, you’ve remained loving. how wonderful! bless you. oceanofpdf.com do not be a doormat all right. let us not confuse being kind to your significant other, family members, friends, or colleagues with being weak. most gentle people have suffered a lot and overcome a ton. their pain has introduced them to their power. they have steel on the inside. sometimes at the end of a mentoring session with a client, during which the discussion has centered on a relationship issue, my client will say to me: “robin, if i’m caring and compassionate and sincere, people will take advantage of me. i don’t want to be a doormat.” my reply usually goes like this: “people will only take advantage of you if you allow them to take advantage of you. you have the ability to set boundaries and to stand up for yourself. so do it. please.” we truly do teach people how to treat us. and—in relationships—we very much get what we settle for. and receive what we accept. the fine balance for you to master is this: be respectful yet assertive. polite yet brave. civil but candid. loving but self-respecting. deal? oceanofpdf.com know that attachment is not love there’s a giant difference between attachment and love. attachment is needy, clingy, and fearful. it arises from gaping wounds and childhood hurts that have yet to be healed (which is why it’s essential to remedy the old cuts that have injured you so you don’t pour hidden pain on people who haven’t harmed you). attachment is insecure and self-centered. it makes us do things—in relationships—that are unhealthy for us. like"

we are programmed to dislike, trained to distrust, and schooled to hate. maybe this day is the day you let down your armor a little. so more love can get in. because on planet earth, our world truly is your family. oceanofpdf.com the th form of wealth craft the work as a platform for purpose habit the desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. — dieter f. uchtdorf oceanofpdf.com the th form of wealth craft | quick overview one of the highest of human hungers is the need for meaning. overwork can cause our health to fail, our relationships to fall, and our aliveness to dim, causing us to lose the essential connection with our native creativity, positivity, and sense of personal freedom. yet a wise balance with the work that we do and a commitment to doing it as skilfully as we can—in honor of our talents and in service to delivering deep value to other human beings—is a bold and intelligent way to significantly build a life that can honestly be described as rich. a job is only a job when seen as a job. and employment only becomes misery when you ignore the opportunity for mastery. realizing that all work is important, all labor has deep dignity and what you do for a living can be viewed as your craft (that can introduce you to hidden personal strengths and locked-away gifts) will flood your life with far greater happiness, energy, and purpose. i really wish this for you in this era where too many good people can’t stand their careers. the majority of us see work as a ball and chain rather than as an offering and a blessing. your occupation, in truth, serves as a chance to make the income that puts food on the family table, a possibility to make inborn potential real, a prospect to push astonishing projects into the field, and a calling to contribute to your community. yes, your work is an enormously valuable currency and a brilliant form of wealth that wisdom demands you value more. so let’s begin exploring the awesome power of transforming your job into your craft and your labor into your art, together. oceanofpdf.com the good nun in the country church yesterday, i walked. you know i love to walk. past olive groves and peaceful horses and vineyards with old vines and leaves upon them that swayed in the breeze. past a donkey that just stared at me. i was far into working on the manuscript of this book for you and needed a fresh place to write, aside from my usual writing room at the farmhouse. so i rented a simple room in a village near a monastery. as i walked along the ancient and winding road, caught up in thought, i encountered a tiny stone church. it was quite marvelous, actually. i think you would have agreed if you’d been on that walk with me. the door of the church was open, a sign of welcome. so i entered. at the front sat a nun, playing a classical organ. she sang with sincere conviction that bordered on the glorious. and a purity that is too rare in the jaded, polarized, messy age we inhabit. here’s the thing: the tiny stone church was completely empty . not another soul was in that place. yet she serenaded as if she were singing for a stadium of thousands. alone in the church, not far from the holy sister, i sat in a pew. closed my eyes. listened to her enchanting song. not making a move. mesmerized. i cried. just a little. i felt alive. elated. even mildly favored. “why?” you wonder. because of that moment. and the exquisite beauty of the scene—a human being heartfeltly showing something that spoke so intensely to me: devotion . so as your gentle long-distance mentor—who really does have your back—may i humbly suggest that to reach your next level of wow as a creator and loftier heights as a craftsperson so that you rise in the fourth form of wealth, you… … be devoted to your hopes, ideals and mighty mission. … be devoted to consistency, mastery, and only what is good. … be devoted to having a clean character and a rich heart. … be devoted to the winning habits of champions and the daily routines of excellence. … be devoted to increasing your connection with others and making them feel bigger in your presence."
sharma,"… be devoted to doing whatever it takes to becoming supremely good at what you do for a living. … be devoted to leaving the earth better than you found it. oceanofpdf.com don’t be so logical you can’t see the magic so what sort of irks me (yet not really, seriously) is when people are so caught up in their heads that they can’t sense their hearts. how will you ever be able to push wonder into the world if you’re blocked to experiencing what wonder feels like? wonder is an essential part of growing your fourth form of wealth, craft . it really, really is. maybe i’m not making sense to you, so let me try again. one of my favorite movies is the banshees of inisherin because it’s so extremely hilarious, dangerous, and beautiful. and downright magical . it’s a film about a friend who no longer wants his best friend to be his best friend. his best friend refuses to let go. and so, the first friend starts chopping off his fingers each time his former best friend visits him. in an effort to get him to stop. hilarious, right? i read a review of the film that said, “i couldn’t stand it because the whole thing was so unbelievable.” really? since when does the genius of a movie depend on its believability? what has happened to our childlike sense of playfulness, outrageousness, and marvelousness in this period of oh-so-much seriousness, scientificness (is that a word?), and mathematicalness (same?)? the words from steven pressfield, the stellar author of the war of art , just bubbled to the surface from my subconscious as i was writing this chapter pleading for you to not hold onto a limited creative reality too tightly: a child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. it’s only you and i, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate. you are a magic-worker, paid and expected and challenged (by the giants of your innate greatness) to push unusually special projects out into our tired, cynical, and unrealistically logical culture. get your daring back. loosen the reins that the status quo (which has sold you a philosophy on what is possible, praiseworthy and necessary) has placed on you. dream again. fail often. take bold risks. get bloodied. then stand back up (having grown stronger and more heroic) and continue. the success of your craft depends on it. oceanofpdf.com the you don’t get lucky you make lucky maxim i was just in an interview in dubai with virgin radio before writing you this message in a notebook that one of my beloved readers handed to me as a gift at a book signing. the utterly splendid interviewer, who was most kind to me, asked, “robin, does everything happen by luck or is it what we do that makes the luck?” “yes.” that was my answer. just “yes.” meaning, it’s both. i do very much believe in apr: absolute personal responsibility . we must rise early, develop our strongest and bravest selves, keep our promises. we need to work hard at work (too many people are faking it at work yet wishing for top results: that won’t work), deliver superior value to those who count on us, be encouraging to our family, make time for healthy recreation, and do our part to have a positive impact. all of these are keys to worldly winning. good things happen to people who do good things. especially to those who wholeheartedly do their jobs like they really care and are devoted to making a difference—even and especially when everyone around them is a checked-out cyberzombie escaping into the digital universe instead of being right here, right now. you see, my friend, we don’t really get lucky—we make lucky. you have such a large part to play in how your life turns out! having said this, i do also believe in destiny. i think that a set of invisible hands guides our journey, is behind instances of synchronicity, and protects us during periods of adversity. that’s just my belief—it may not be yours, and that’s just fine with me. my sense is that heaven helps those who help themselves. do your best and then let life do the rest is what i’m really trying to remind you of, with love and respect. should something not work out (like losing a job or ending a relationship), please don’t fall into the trap of self-deception. don’t cbe: complain, blame and excuse. instead, take an honest, hard look at your part in the loss. and improve what needs to improve so it doesn’t keep happening. that’s apr. and part of being a high-functioning, honestly rich human being. you don’t want to be like that person who keeps stumbling through relationship after relationship and saying, “why aren’t there any outstanding people out there for me?” having reinforced the importance of apr, once you’ve looked in the mirror and taken deep accountability for your piece in the outcome, let go . and trust that if you were meant to be—in your best interests—where you wished you’d be, then you’d be there, if you get my drift? and if you’re not where you hoped to be, something even better is in the cards for you. exercise your inherent wisdom to know that a failure is only a failure when seen as a failure. every so-called failure carries a secret fortune, just begging you to pay attention to it. i’ve grown the most from my most tragic experiences. while enduring them, i wished they would end. now—after time has passed—i see that they arrived to serve me so well. to help dissolve my ego, raise my wisdom, build intimacy with my gifts and open my heart to greater love. i encourage you not to waste a difficult time. actually, as strange as it sounds, stay in it as long as possible because the growth you can"
sharma,"get from it is priceless. and, on reflection, i really am grateful that i didn’t get everything i wanted. because where life was leading ended up being vastly brighter. the same holds true for you. oceanofpdf.com start a stop doing list most of us have a to do list. when i was a young litigation lawyer, i actually ran my entire life by one. everything was written down and i lived off this list with military-grade precision. it wasn’t much fun. but i did get a lot done. the to do list that so many of us keep often contains our work commitments, team meetings, bill payments, grocery items, and social events. that’s fine. good, actually. keep it going if it serves you well. and yet, i’d like to tell you about something i now do differently, which serves me nicely: a stop doing list . you see, a great and sweet life (and career) is so much more about what you choose to stop doing than what you vowed to start doing. your list might include the decision to: … stop comparing your real life to the fake lives manufactured (with filters and all) online. … stop buying so many things you really don’t need, understanding that being frugal is super smart in a time of influencers encouraging you to eat in expensive restaurants, purchase luxury clothes, and fly to places they really can’t afford. … stop accepting every social invitation that comes your way because you have a deep-seated addiction to being liked. … stop stressing about problems that are not real and worrying about things that will probably never happen. “remember, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday,” said dale carnegie. … stop complaining about how impossible that assignment you’re working on is and start getting the work done. (one step at a time is how masterpieces are made; remember the great pyramid of giza earlier in our work together?) … stop saying yes to business opportunities that you really should say no to. … stop spending the prime hours of your days engaging in superficial distractions and digital diversions. … stop giving anything less than your finest effort in everything you do at your job. … stop following the pack and start leading the field. … stop scrolling when it’s time to be creating and stop chitchatting when it’s time to be producing. you have only this life to live. your happiness, healthiness, greatness, and wealthiness depend on using your days well. so shift from focusing mostly on the things you need to do into a clearer and more concentrated sense of what you need to strip out of your hours. mastery is far more about the pursuit of simplicity than the seduction of complexity. and a meaningful and satisfying life is sometimes more about what you take out of it than what you put into it. oceanofpdf.com avoid the “no one will notice it” lie steve jobs’s real hero was his adoptive father, a remarkably great craftsman who sweated every detail to make perfectly formed furniture in his free time. as a boy, jobs would watch him measure the wood with fierce precision, line up the corners with near obsession, and be monomaniacally focused on getting the job done at a world-class level. one day, his father instructed him to go paint the fence outside their home and he did as told. a few hours later, his father appeared. “steve, did you paint the fence?” “i did, dad, look,” the young jobs replied, pointing to the structure. his father carefully inspected the work then observed, “steve you’ve done a nice job painting the outside of the fence, but you didn’t paint the inside of the fence.” steve responded, “but, dad, no one will see the inside of the fence.” his father smiled, paused and then said, “but, son, we will.” many years later, jobs was working with his design team on the first apple macintosh. his instruction to his group? make the computer beautiful on the outside. make it look special, wonderful, and sensational. but the real mission, he pronounced, was to make the inside of the machine a work of art. someone on the team mused, “but, steve, no one will see the inside of the computer.” and, of course, jobs paused and then replied: “but we will.” you see, whatever you do at work, the bravest and sagest part of you sees everything —and i do mean everything— you do. and each time you betray your greatness by doing something that you know disrespects your genius, a small part of you dies. part of you loses self-respect. part of your enthusiasm, optimism, and hopefulness leaves you. each act of average causes your promise to become defeated. and potential unexpressed turns to pain. so when you feel like playing small with your gifts or going minuscule with your personal magic, just remember that someone is always watching you. and that someone is always your highest you. oceanofpdf.com bring a security guard to work on a podcast i heard a while ago, i learned author neil strauss has a quirky yet creative practice designed to ensure he gets a big project done. he hires a security guard with the instruction to stand outside of his home and not—under any condition—let him leave until his book is completed. you can have fun all the time or realize your personal potential. it’s not really possible to have both, is it? like strauss, you absolutely must develop strategies and protocols that force you to finish the work you know you must finish to lead your field and to make the world a friendlier place, because you’ve pushed your artistry into it. you might not bring a security guard to work. but you really should do something dramatic to complete your most valuable project. before the opportunity to get it done is gone. oceanofpdf.com use the virtuoso algorithm if you were sitting in front of me and asked"
sharma,"me to summarize in a simple formula what makes the greatest ceos, billionaires, entrepreneurs, professional athletes, and leadership teams great, here’s what i’d offer: yes, that’s exactly what i’d draw for you on a napkin. “growth” means that you must study and refine your craft more than average performers in your domain, so you have the insight to do purely what the best do. “practice” in the equation is obviously about putting in the training hours so you get the mileage required to capitalize on making your inborn talents into outer genius. “teachers” is a code word for securing terrific mentors who help you steadily improve your skill of focus and save you years of time wasted doing the wrong things. and “associations” refers to the humans you hang with. spend most of your days with those who are devoted to becoming supreme in their field and their energy, mastery, audacity, and work ethic will rub off on you. the denominator in the formula has two important words in it that i’d invite you to consider. “resilience” is the trait of turning failure into fuel and stumbling blocks into stepping stones. most performers give up quickly, so they get zero traction around their inspiring vision. fortune favors the relentless. remember that. and “longevity” is the basic yet important idea that unusual success comes by staying in the game longer than the world tells you is reasonable, responsible and rational. to get to biw (best in world), you must outlive your peers. and the key to becoming legendary is extending your lifespan within your domain. my final thought in this message is reinforcement to trust the quiet whispers that come to you in the most unexpected moments, instructing you on the enterprise that you must pursue to discover the height of the powers that light you up. this is the very project that, once done with concentration, carefulness, and courage, will also light up the world. “a person should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across their mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages. yet we dismiss without notice our thought, because it is ours. in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty,” wrote the mighty philosopher ralph waldo emerson. take five minutes, now, and reflect on these words. your intuition is extraordinary, and your insights are strong. ignore the haters and overlook the critics. advance your virtuosity and you’re bound to experience the joys, satisfactions, and generally untalked-about treasures of treating your job as a craft, the fourth form of wealth. oceanofpdf.com learning is your superpower a closed mind never raises the world. and an exceptional performer who stops consistently growing, optimizing, and evolving in their area of expertise is declining, often without knowing (until it’s too late). which brings us to the mission-essential power of learning. education is inoculation against disruption. and the creative producer who learns the most, wins. for many years, i’ve taught a primary principle to my billionaire, ceo and movement-maker clients known as the xx mindset . it will help you upgrade your dominance in any field you may wish to lead. here it is: to double your income and your impact, triple your investment in two core areas—your personal mastery and your professional capability. too many good people are suffering from the restricted belief that genius is a divine gift rather than a daily practice. it took mozart ten years of focus, training, and persistence before the first signs of his mastery revealed themselves. jane goodall, the revered primate scientist, studied chimpanzees for decades before she truly expressed her exceptionalism. einstein worked as a postal clerk and struggled in anonymity for years before arriving at the general theory of relativity, which revolutionized the understanding of physics. aristotle onassis arrived in buenos aires, after a treacherous voyage from greece on an ocean liner, with only $ in his pocket before embarking on the long journey of building the enterprises and entrepreneurial powers that made him the financially richest entrepreneur of his day. each of these people started small, learned what they needed to learn to win and never, ever stopped improving their art. as simple as it sounds, their winning formula was that they always wanted to get better, through self-education. and definitely understand that if you think “i can’t become a force in my field,” or “superstars are made of stardust different from mine,” or “the best are blessed with rare talents i just don’t have,” rather than knowing that genius within a craft is born from a marvelous alchemy of focus, learning, training, mentorship, execution, persistence, and the passage of time, then that flawed thinking will eventually wire into a limiting subconscious belief. in other words, if you’re telling yourself a psychological story that says, “i am average, so i must operate at ordinary,” that will manifest as your reality. because your daily behavior always reflects your deepest beliefs. restricted thinking always creates a faulty program that writes a story that then becomes your self-identity. this, in turn, determines how you show up each day. yes, your thinking is a self-fulfilling prophecy. and what you believe about your potential becomes real. the respected psychologist carol dweck has found, through her rigorous research, that world-class performers have “a growth mindset,” rather than a fixed one. in other words, they see opportunity in such a way that, if they don’t have a skill, they understand they can learn it. and if they want to master a subject, they get that deep practice and concentrated effort will help them own it. those who choose to operate via a growth mindset have agency over their lives and a closely held appreciation that all human beings have the power to get better, each day. by learning what they must and then doing what’s needed to improve, versus waiting for the stars to align."
sharma,"study. study. study. and read, read, read! i know of few other investments that give you the exponential rate of return that a great book does. for a few dollars, you can get into the minds of the greatest people who have lived. you can discover their philosophies, embrace their daily habits, understand how they handcrafted their masterworks, discover how they overcame adversity, and grow inspired by their paths. the victim says elite performance is too hard and so wastes precious hours in front of their big tv. the superstar gets that mastery takes study, effort, patience, and dedication. and spends a ton of time building a large library. “in my whole life, i have known no wise people who didn’t read all the time—none, zero,” remarked fabled investor (and warren buffett’s business partner) charlie munger. beautiful, right? oceanofpdf.com develop a lust for books sorry, but i will not stop encouraging you to read more books. because i want you to fill your mind and heart and home with them. to be surrounded by wisdom—by having stacks of texts (yes, i like the paper ones best)—is one of the best things in life. at least for me. and i’m pretty sure for you. here’s a quick list of a few of the reasons to read for at least an hour every day (for the remainder of your life): reason #: reading—in an age of online algorithms feeding you information and media bias—allows you to make the revolutionary step of thinking for yourself. by consuming content from many authors—of different opinions—you can form your own conclusions on the topics that matter. and avoid operating in an echo chamber. reason #: reading helps you go deep in a culture gone light. rather than digital snacking on information through one-line messages and ten-second videos, immersing yourself in a book (especially a hard one to read) builds the muscles that make you a heavyweight thinker. and this ability, in turn, will allow you the gca (gargantuan competitive advantage) of being one of the rare-air few who have the mental toughness to solve difficult problems. reason #: reading lengthens your attention span in an environment where the majority suffers from the profound weakness of not being able to focus. all geniuses have built supreme levels of concentration—which causes them to regularly enter the flow state for endless hours where they access the near-magical ideas that eventually make them legendary. reason #: reading raises your knowledge base, which aids you in pushing more magic into the marketplace. growing in insight also reduces the number of mistakes you’ll make as you leverage the wisdom of the giants you study. this means less wasted time, less personal pain, and a whole lot less hardship. reason #: reading elevates your inspiration. you can’t inspire your followers, customers, and industry if your own well of inspiration is empty. a superb way to stay optimistic, enthusiastic, and overflowing with contagious positive energy is to read works of heroic exploits. read the biographies of adventurers who scaled the highest summits and explored desolate deserts. study the autobiographies of the inventors who overcame the odds and entrepreneurs who transcended common limits. associate with the great men and women of history who freed captive nations, launched global movements, and represented the best humanity has to offer by reading of their lives, by moving through their books. i could list many more reasons that i want you to read everything you can get your hands on and turn pages instead of watching amusing videos (that often leave you feeling intellectually emptier and spiritually poorer than before you began). i’ll say it again because i really care about your rise: read daily! read daily! read daily! oceanofpdf.com live the grandmaster beginner law before sitting down to write this mentoring message to you in my messy writing room, i walked on a new trail in the woods with superchum. amazingly, a white-tailed doe jumped out of the trees and sprang across my path. it was magical! a sign of some sort? anyway. enough of that. let’s jump right into the lesson i wish to share with you today so your positivity, productivity, leadership, and service to society can soar. and here it is: the thing about great masters is that they always think like beginners. that’s a good mantra to meditate on, write about, and work thoughtfully around. too many superproducers and top performers reach the peak and then start thinking they know it all or are invincible and can never be knocked off their lofty perch. and of course, this mentality is the start of the end. because mastery without humility breeds mediocrity. kobe bryant, at the height of his powers and peak of his prowess, used to show up at the gym at dawn. no excuses. no complaints. no rationalizations for skipping the training because he was a superstar and could do whatever he wished. although he was a master, he behaved like a beginner, hungry to learn, obsessed with improvement, and fanatical about growth. in the fascinating documentary the redeem team , one team usa basketball player recounts how he and his teammates partied all night in a club, enjoying themselves in the foreign city they were in. he then recalled that on entering the lobby of their hotel, they saw kobe in full gym gear. holding a bag with his weightlifting gloves. sweat pouring down his face from an early morning workout. staring at them. intensely . it was am . (i guess the am club started too late for him.) the example set by kobe that day affected the entire team. his commitment became contagious. many talked about what they had seen that morning for days afterward, speaking about kobe bryant’s dedication, fierce love of the game, and ferocious desire to win the olympic gold medal. and guess what? by the end of the week, the entire team had become mesmerized by his devotion. they were in the gym just past daybreak,"

(when was the last time you spotted magic in the marketplace?) i recall taking my mother to the galleria dell’accademia in florence. her face on walking into the main room and seeing michelangelo’s david can never be erased from my memory. mom was enchanted. by the beauty, skill and scale of the masterpiece. all i’m suggesting to you here is that you become one of those rare and remarkable producers who refuse to chase every shiny opportunity and have the discipline (and guts) to focus on a single work that, when refined, calibrated, polished, optimized and then nearly perfected (even if it takes ages to get the gorgeous thing done), makes the jaws of the world drop. each of us has within us a magnum opus. a grand and glorious venture that—on the thought of it—fills us with excitement, enchantment, and the richly felt sense that our lives matter. yes, do your project x. your eiffel tower. your mona lisa . your theory of relativity. your penicillin. your concorde. your empire state building. your guernica . your titanic . (okay, maybe the last one isn’t the best idea. yet you get my point.) i feel we are steadily growing as friends. and friends are candid with each other. and so, i must say this to you: nothing is so heartbreaking as getting to your end with your magnificence frozen within you. to live your richest life, you really must do some soul-searching (now!) and start the process of discovering the one enterprise that—even if it takes a lifetime to complete—will stand as your monument to the best creativity, highest productivity, and outright poetry within you. not one hundred projects. not fifty. not twenty. nope. what’s the one initiative that your heart has been telling you that you need to do to honestly honor the greatness within? and once you figure it out, begin it. immediately. oceanofpdf.com hard work is great work the venture you’re most resisting is the one you most need to start doing. all too often, we think that the project that terrifies us is the one to avoid. no. that’s the one to accept . because the fears we don’t face become our walls. and the opportunities we run away from rob us of our genius. as well, remember that the hardest work ends up being the highest fuel for our satisfaction. it’s such a paradox, right? yet the truth really is that by the consistent doing of difficult things you’ll build intimacy with the brilliance, strongness, and goodness that currently await untapped within you. getting to know these usually invisible parts brings lasting joy. knowledge of our heroic selves brings huge happiness. and in the solving of tough problems, fulfilment, meaning, and purpose become our constant companions. this is why i say that courageously pursuing (and pushing) your craft is a form of wealth. and an incredible source of riches in your life. in some circles these days, hard work has a bad name. sure, we must rest, recover and enjoy the fruits of our labor. yet going all in on the professional pursuits you choose to commit to will bring immense energy, confidence, enthusiasm, and peacefulness to your days. the habit of working really hard works really well. it’ll give you a giant advantage over all the people who say they want a rich life yet won’t do anything to make one. and make your life so much more special. oceanofpdf.com first drafts are meant to be bad ernest hemingway said something that has helped me enormously as an artist always working to improve my craft: “the first draft of anything is sh*t.” now, i don’t like foul words, yet i need to accurately quote what he wrote. and the insight behind what he said is monumentally important for us to understand. when i work on a book, i rush to get the initial manuscript done. i don’t worry much about spelling or technique or finding the perfect calibration of words. instead, i just"
sharma,"push to get the main ideas down. this, then, gives me the feeling the work is mostly done even though it’s just the beginning. psychologically it makes me feel like the heavy lifting is over, even though it’s not. then, on the next drafts, i cut and rework and replace and polish (over and over and over again). in bird by bird , writer anne lamott tells the story of her father’s advice to her brother, who was finding it hard to finish a project on birds. just take it “bird by bird” was the advice. nice. lamott also said that first drafts are meant to be bad. remember this. quickly produce the earliest version of your project x. it’ll give you momentum—and the feeling most of the drudgery is done. then, take it page by page, brushstroke by brushstroke, bird by bird. if you know what i mean. on each draft that follows, add and subtract. improve and iterate. keep making the continuous and tiniest of changes that move the work from the mundane toward the masterful. until you arrive at the finest result you have inside of you to send out into a universe craving your magic. oceanofpdf.com stop copying your heroes “i don’t care that they stole my idea. i care that they don’t have any of their own,” the world-changing inventor nikola tesla once stated. he deserves far more credit for his ideas and creations than he currently receives, by the way. because he was a better thinker than promoter, others less brilliant have become more prominent. anyway, what i’d love for you to think about as you scale your creativity, upgrade your productivity, and calibrate your craft toward increasing the fourth form of wealth in your life is the uncommon display of originality . here’s an important maxim to tattoo onto your brain: you can copy your heroes or you can influence your industry, but you’ll never be able to do both. often people copy because they are in scarcity. they are scared because they don’t think they have enough creativity to allow them to win. so they take the easy way out—and steal the ideas of others. or they are so disconnected from the imagination and talent that lie at their core, they ignore the instructions their muse is offering them. another key concept: the marketplace rewards the delivery of original magic. (stop reading and write this line in your journal a few times so it drops deeper into your understanding.) tesla and gaga. da vinci and jobs. ali and jordan. dickinson and einstein. they all have one thing in common: they brought fresh value to their area of influence. rather than following the herd, thinking like the majority, and passively fitting in, they stood out, got really, really, really good at their craft and then shared their virtuosity with many. oh, and once you start releasing originality, innovation, and breathtakingly great invention into your field, know and trust that the marketplace will reply with what i call in my mentoring methodology the rewards of mastery: reward #: income. inspire, delight, and serve more people and you’ll receive a larger paycheck. because money is a by-product of problems solved and helpfulness rendered. reward #: influence . the more you have the focus, wisdom, and execution ability to bring your natural genius into the light of day, the more people will appreciate and applaud your expertise. that brings you the second reward of mastery—power. and the result of influence. reward #: freedom. yes, the third gift you’re bound to get on becoming a virtuoso is the freedom that flows as your income grows and your influence expands. you’ll be able to do whatever you want to do, with whomever you want to do it, whenever you wish to do it. the main idea for you to embrace before i leave you here and begin to cook a pasta dinner with fresh basil, ripe tomatoes from our farm, and olive oil so splendid it makes me want to sing from the treetops? stop copying your heroes. no one on the planet today can create, deliver and operate quite the same way as you. so rather than working hard to be the second-best version of someone you admire, may i politely suggest you invest your finest work hours in becoming the single greatest vision of yourself. oceanofpdf.com just be friendly winning at work is so easy because there are so few people doing the things that lead to winning at work these days. success lies in a masterful consistency around the fundamentals. and too few are very good at the basics, like doing your job with a sense of pride, care, and friendliness for others. here’s an example to make my point. maybe with a little humor. i was in a big north american city, out for a long walk in the rain (walking in the rain is one of my favorite things). as i walked, i spotted a small shop that advertised coffee with adaptogens—substances that boost brain focus, memory, energy, and hardiness against the toxic results of unmanaged stress. i was fascinated by the way everything was branded and packaged. so i entered. the young hipster with a cool hat behind the counter didn’t say a word. just looked at me blankly and then went back to his phone. the place was pretty much empty, yet he didn’t seem happy to see me. no sweat. i smiled. and said “hi.” he grunted a greeting, as people who spend too much time in online pursuits usually do because they no longer know how to connect with other humans. and have forgotten the sweetness of this particular habit. and have lost sight of what most matters to a life richly led. i studied the products. they looked amazing. the founder of the firm had clearly invested a lot of thinking (and money) in creating excellent goods that would help people perform at their best. i asked the"
sharma,"young man if this was a chain or a single shop. “single,” he said, as cold as an ice bath. then he swayed his body to the hipster music he was playing. i’m serious. he did some freaky moves to the music instead of taking my question seriously. i wish you’d been there with me. you would have found the dancing quirky too. i asked if the supplements came in smaller packages that i could take home rather than simply being consumed at the shop, mixed with the coffee they made there. “no, we used to have little packages but not anymore,” he replied, not looking up from his fully loaded phone. another freaky dance move like an otherworldly robot. then a “tap tap tap” on the device with his finger, checking something that was clearly far more urgent than me. to be present to another person. to give a human the stellar gift of even the mildest of exuberance on greeting them. to display fluent product knowledge, along with unusual expertise when helping them. and to show sincere dedication to making the days of others happier is how you discover victory at work, while calibrating your craft. and raise your own self-respect, inspiration, career, and lifestyle in the mix. how easy it is to forget this! just do the basics and focus on the fundamentals. because so few are doing them anymore. whenever you’re wondering how you should show up when you’re with a customer, teammate, supplier or other individual standing before you, remember the hipster with the very strange dance moves. the one with the cool hat. and just be friendly. oceanofpdf.com set your daily a productivity protocol that the clients i advise have found exceedingly useful is the daily . it’s pretty simple—like all valuable tools. each day, simply set five tiny triumphs, little wins or granular goals that you promise yourself you will get done before the day ends. because as you now know well: small, daily, seemingly insignificant improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results . and it’s not what you do once in a while that will get you to great, but what you do every day. no matter what’s on your plate and how your life is currently running, you can definitely get five microvictories done. examples of easy things to do include: … make your bed as soon as you get up. … do twenty push-ups after you brush your teeth. … do a fifteen-minute meditation before breakfast. … skip breakfast and fast for a few hours. … write a few things you’re grateful for in your morning journal. … prepare a love letter to your partner. …spend the first hour of work on real work versus busy work. … send a handwritten thank you note to someone who has helped your progress. … watch a learning video that will optimize your top skill. … spend an hour on the project that will most promote your career. … find something encouraging to say to a teammate. … notice something in your day that makes you feel more alive and savor it. … do something kind for a stranger on the street. … have a family meal free of technology. … write three things you’re grateful for before you go to sleep. here’s the powerful point i want you to play with: five granular wins done each day become one hundred and fifty in just a month and eighteen hundred improvements in just one year. the coming twelve months are absolutely certain to become the most productive, successful, and phenomenal twelve months of your life (yet) as you make eighteen hundred tiny goals real. oceanofpdf.com think like an artist i adore the artwork of the american maestro jean-michel basquiat. i’m a massive fan of the abstract painting of austrian luminary martha jungwirth. i can stare at a portrait created by the modern-day south african master lionel smit in a gallery for hours and hours, losing myself in his brilliance. art, to me, makes life more beautiful, easier and better. it makes dull days brighter. and when i am in the presence of artistic greatness, just a little of their giftedness rubs off on me. leaving my craft a bit higher. okay. think like an artist. this is the instruction, and the request, that i have of you. no matter what you do for work, you are a creative. and what you produce (whether it’s pizza or screenplays, companies or code, start-ups or spin classes) is your precious art. your good name is on it. so make what you make extraordinary. otherwise, don’t do it. four practical lessons to encourage you here: lesson #: make the work you produce today better than yesterday’s output and the work you do this year exponentially better than that of the last one. lesson #: care more about quality than anyone in your industry. mastery or nothing! know that excellence is an energy . people can feel it without you having to say it. we can all sense when we are in the company of greatness. lesson #: exploit your strangeness and mine your oddness. the weird things about you are the very things that can make your native genius real. think through, journal about, and meditate upon the unique quirks, talents, and strengths that set you apart from everyone else. then, develop and amplify them. lesson #: trust that mistakes are the gateway into artistry, and failure is the price your talent must pay to fully express itself. use your errors, setbacks, and messes as fuel for artistic power. as nietzsche said, “chaos gives birth to dancing stars.” live out on the skinny branch (it’s dangerous on the limb but that’s where all the fruit is!). take more creative risks. don’t be afraid to look foolish, and always remember that no one takes seriously the person who takes themselves too seriously. think like an artist. because you are one. oceanofpdf.com find your personal goldeneye"
sharma,"to produce your masterwork, you need to be alone a lot. i’m not saying working with a team isn’t important or helpful. the bigger the dream, the more essential the team. and as i’ve said earlier, a profound connection with family and friends is an essential foundation for genuine success. having noted this, my real point here is that in a time of extreme technological stimulation, hyperdistraction, and cognitive overload, you really, really, really need to force yourself to get away from your usual life on a regular basis to do world-class work, even if that’s only for a few hours each day. all artists have studios where they retreat daily. all scientists have their labs where they labor and conduct experiments. all pro athletes have their gyms. and all legendary musicians have their practice rooms. “all medicine men live in caves,” observed artist jean-michel basquiat. to me, that means you can be in the noise of the world or make your masterpieces through being alone—but never both. your genius is begging you for more silence, solitude, and stillness. and all multiple-masterwork-makers understand that where you work profoundly shapes the quality of the work—so they place themselves in scenes that inspire their most monumental productivity. ian fleming, the famous writer of the james bond novels, purchased a marvelous cottage on the ocean in jamaica where he would go to find quietude and generate the all-important flow state to create the stories that have entertained millions. he called his place goldeneye. if this major performer gained such inspiration, execution energy and productivity to complete his extraordinary body of work by getting away from the loudness of society, shouldn’t you find your goldeneye too? oceanofpdf.com go the extra mile when i was writing the am club (it took me four full years to get it done, and getting that book to the absolute best i could make it became a mission that bordered on an obsession), i traveled by train to a small european town and found a hotel to stay in for a week to write. i made more progress on the manuscript in that one week than i’d made in the previous month of working at home. on that trip, someone from room service provided my morning lemon tea with a curious feature i’ve never forgotten: the lemon halves had the seeds carved out of them. i’m not sure if i’m being clear here, so allow me to be clearer: rather than simply cutting the lemon in half so i could squeeze the juice into the hot water, some dedicated soul had taken the time and gone to the trouble to carefully cut the seeds out so they wouldn’t fall into my tea. i was so impressed by this unusual act of unexpected excellence that i mentioned it in the book. i called the concept deseeding the lemon wedges, a metaphor for showing the painstaking attention to detail that is the bedrock of becoming a master of your craft. as i write you today’s mentoring message, i’m back at the same hotel. and guess what? i have a new metaphor for you, based on today’s cup of tea. i ordered fresh mint tea. eva, the chirpy and exquisitely exuberant young woman who answered the phone, was fantastic. all over the details, super responsible, and utterly caring. “it’ll be fifteen minutes, if that’s okay?” she said in her singsong voice. sure enough, precisely fifteen minutes later (i am in switzerland), eva was at my door. with a smile the size of the sun along with eyes that sparkled like a star. and a vibe that made me increase my love for being a part of the human race. as i looked at the tray that had gently been placed upon the table in front of me, i noticed that eva had not only put a bundle of fresh mint leaves into the teapot, she’d added a flourish: a single green artistically placed mint leaf in the ivory white teacup. you might say, “robin, that’s such a small thing.” nope. to me, it was gigantic . in an era in which so few underpromise and overdeliver, and when so many individuals want the rewards of their richest life without having to invest the commitment and do the work that a supremely rewarding life requires, eva shone in her craft. she exemplified this fourth form of wealth. she exercised her creativity and then modeled the currency of mastery to pick off that one mint leaf and position it ever so perfectly in the teacup to make a little piece of art. so now, i have a new metaphor for going the extra mile at work in order to mesmerize all those you meet: maximizing the mint leaf. and if the habit worked for eva, i am certain it’ll work for you. oceanofpdf.com be patient like a pro i’ll tell you a secret to owning your game that isn’t really a secret. but i’ll call it a secret in the hope it’ll help you pay more attention to it. the secret is… patience . so simple. practical. blindingly obvious. it’s a strategy that hides in plain sight. therefore, so few (and i do mean few) practice it with any form of consistency. “rivers know this: there is no hurry. we shall get there some day,” wrote the children’s author a. a. milne. today, i’m in the stylish city of milan. the blossoms are on the trees and the flowers are on tall parade. my italian friends and milanese readers will hate me for telling you this, but i visited the grand starbucks here for the first time. (i’ll whisper this: it was very good.) i listened to an amazing street musician play a coldplay song, then something by drake, then “love yourself” by justin bieber. (i’ll whisper this, but i really like that song.) then i walked to the famed monument called the duomo. spellbinding. breathtaking, actually. i saw the spires and arches and"
sharma,"the intensely intricate craftwork. did you know that construction began in and the final details were finished in ? that’s six hundred years . on a single project. now let me ask you, in my most cheerful way: do you have the devotion to stay with the perfecting of your project x for six hundred years ? until the project is done. to sublime completion. the way it’s meant to be done. in celebration of your natural talents. makes me think of what michelangelo said: “genius is eternal patience.” we inhabit a civilization where most people have the attention span of a sparrow. do you want to seriously win at work and be so far ahead of your peers that they’ll never catch up to you (in six hundred years )? yes? great. then become the most enduring person in your field and the most tireless producer in your arena. sweat the most infinitesimal of details. reach for the standards of the superstars. don’t let go. never give up. get the tiniest brushstrokes to grandmaster level. then make it even better. i dare you. oceanofpdf.com be like a dog with a bone yes. be like a dog with a bone, who doesn’t let go. you see, one of the main keys to mastery is persistency. and it really is remarkable how far you can get in hot pursuit of your personal mount everests if you simply, absolutely and totally refuse to quit. so straightforward. so few do this. allow me to offer you one of my favorite examples. jimmy iovine, now a titan of the music industry and a legendary record producer, wanted to woo trent reznor of nine inch nails fame away from a small independent record company that held the rights to his music. the owner of that outfit was tough—and not at all interested in letting his prized artist leave. iovine’s solution—as shared in the wonderful documentary the defiant ones —was to rise early every morning and perform a ritual. he’d walk into his bathroom, where he kept a phone, shut the door and call the owner. he did this each morning—at am — for nearly an entire year . eventually, the owner relented—because jimmy iovine was unstoppable. he admitted that he felt the producer made him feel understood and respected. so he did the deal and gave up the rights, leading to a hugely successful partnership. in the documentary, when iovine was asked why he wouldn’t give up on acquiring reznor for his roster of musical artists and why he called in the morning for close to days in a row, he said that it’s important not to let your ego get in the way of the result you’re committed to achieving. i’ve never forgotten that lesson. not letting pride and looking silly in the eyes of others get in the way of realizing your target. i hope—truly—that you won’t forget this instruction. and if others do laugh at you because of your relentless belief in yourself and your ethical ambition to get a brave dream done, recall what dr. seuss once wrote: “be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.” oceanofpdf.com enjoy the time you waste “time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time,” noted musical maestro john lennon. took me much of my early adult life to understand this one. if i wasn’t working or running my schedule or crossing off my to do list, i felt guilty. as well as some sense of shame, i guess. just being honest. i see a lot of offline gurus and online influencers advising their followers to “hustle and grind” and to “use every waking moment to be productive and get ahead.” yikes! isn’t that kind of advice merely a belief system taught to us by a culture obsessed with doing, achieving, striving, and winning? but why must winning be solely defined by getting more accomplished than others and reaching the summit of worldly success? why are fame and fortune more prized than inner peace and personal freedom? why is the entrepreneur who gets a trillion things done and the billionaire who banks a ton of cash more valued (in our oh-so-strange culture) than the monk who sits in meditation in a monastery all day? or the joyful gardener raising their bright yellow tulips? how come the person who does their work well, then reserves their evenings for their family, passions, and human enthusiasms, is considered less “productive” than the one who is on call //? who sold us this bill of goods on what productivity means? and why, if we don’t fill every waking hour with work, are we unworthy of being considered successful? to go even further, why is doing nothing seen as a bad thing? tell me. seriously. who sold us the idea that doing something is better than doing nothing? in truth—and i’m not sure if i’m making sense to you here—they are just different things. one really isn’t better than the other, is it? only our judgment and belief system make it so. it’s just that we’ve been taught by those we trust (and those who influence us) that one is better than the other. i’ve learned to get really efficient at non-doing. because a strong work ethic without a deep rest ethic won’t stand the test of time. when i work, i work swiftly, intensely, and precisely—extremely focused on the few things that count. (confucius said it magnificently: “the person who chases two rabbits catches neither.”) and when i don’t work, i enjoy my life, savoring the fruits of my labor. staring at trees as i walk in my olive grove. taking winding drives in the countryside with elle, making dinner for my daughter, visiting an art gallery with my son. reading interesting books, riding my trusty mountain bike, writing in my journal, listening to country music, going for a swim in the sea. my enthusiastic encouragement is"
sharma,"that you become a masterful loafer at times. a total champion of doing zero when it’s time to renew. like i did last night. just sitting outside on a cool night with a blanket over my legs, staring up at the stars. doing nothing was really something. oceanofpdf.com apply the -second anti-procrastination rule let’s shift gears from the last chapter. all peak achievers have one behavior in common: they don’t just dream great dreams, they also do everything necessary to get them done. they get that ideation without execution honestly is delusion. and that the smallest of actions truly is always so much better than the grandest of intentions. in this way of operating, they show their craft that they are committed and their mastery that they are serious. so my encouragement for you is this: never leave the site of a spectacular idea without doing something—anything—to bring it into reality . keep repeating this mantra, over and over: “i will do it now.” what you speak about shapes what you’ll produce in the world. and then, when a bold and audacious inspiration surfaces, take swift action—within sixty seconds—to make even the smallest bit of progress on it. so that you defeat procrastination. and always keep moving forward. “until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then providence moves too,” said mountaineer william hutchison murray. i guess he was teaching us that there’s a difference between busyness and productivity, movement and progress. and that nothing happens until we start. oceanofpdf.com while you’re working, keep improving i recently overheard a conversation i need to tell you about. i was having lunch in a restaurant. a man wanted a glass of red wine. he pointed to a variety on the menu. the server looked at the wine list and then said, “this one? i’m not going to pronounce the name properly, but i’ll try.” he then mangled the name of the wine. and walked off to get it for the guest. just out of curiosity, when the server came to our table, i asked him how long he’d worked at the restaurant. “this will be my eleventh year,” he replied proudly. hmmm…eleven years. at this restaurant. taking orders for food and wine. spending many of his most valuable hours here. giving his incredibly precious life energy to this job. given the opportunity to be an expert at what he does. to become a merchant of wow. to receive huge tips. yet for some reason, he didn’t seem to take his work—his craft (a currency that could bring him not only vast professional, financial and personal rewards but spiritual ones too)—seriously. he never took the time to study the wine list so he could learn to pronounce the names properly. it appeared to me he just showed up, day after day. for eleven years. as a contrast, consider ferran adrià, the founder and chef of the iconic michelin three-star restaurant el bulli. known for leading the field of molecular gastronomy, providing his guests thirty-four-course meals, and mesmerizing fellow chefs by his monomaniacal obsession with getting details flawless, at the height of el bulli’s fame (two million people applied each season to get one of the rare reservations), adrià closed the place. although he could have made a financial fortune with his creations (his “chicken curry” turned the traditional recipe on its head by placing the chicken sauce over curry ice cream) and he was heralded as “the best cook on the planet” by super-chef joël robuchon, he shuttered his shop because he felt he had gone as far as he could as a chef. and needed to explore fresh challenges for his growth as an artist. here’s the takeaway: the moment you’re at the top of your game and near the apex of your powers is the minute you need to push yourself to shatter your winning formula, recalibrate the skills that have served you so well, and imagine new ways to completely reinvent yourself. the alternative? mediocrity. and a quick descent into obscurity. oceanofpdf.com labor for the magic, never for the money superstar athlete and supreme entrepreneur shaquille o’neal was on my faculty for a live event and shared three powerful lessons i trust will bring value to you. i’ll jump right into them: lesson #: keep your kids humble and grounded. when his children would say, “dad, let’s buy this—we’re rich,” he’d reply, “you’re not rich, i am.” the old adage “shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations” is generally true. financial wealth is often made by the first, enjoyed by the second and lost in the third. lesson #: remember your roots. too many people reach world-class success in their field then forget who brought them to the dance. shaq explained to my audience that before every home game the lakers would play, he’d drive to his former neighborhood—in a poor area of los angeles—and shoot hoops with the kids on the street. then he’d get back into his car and drive to the game. i asked him why he would do this. his reply was classic: “because those kids used to be me.” lesson #: never work purely for the money. shaq shared that—as an entrepreneur—when he did a deal only for the promise of a massive cash jackpot, the ventures always failed. yet when he accepted an opportunity because it inspired him, because it would force him to grow as a leader and because it just felt right, the results were inevitably excellent. yes, my friend, do your work for more than just the money. do it for the growth it will give you. do it for the talents it will introduce you to. do it for the person it will make of you. do it for the meaning it will deliver to you."

(the finest way to give, right?) near the end of his life, kenny sailors was asked about his “final four”—a term used for the important playoff matches in college basketball, where all teams in the league have been eliminated except for the finest four. the interviewer was now spinning the term into a question that was really about the four most important things to him. “god, being a great husband, a loving father and a good marine.” basketball wasn’t even on the list. kenny died at ninety-five. as a hero. in my eyes—and in the eyes of many. this humble man lived simply, honorably, happily, and with deep integrity. the real takeaway of this mentoring message? when it comes to pursuing your craft and rising to absolutely world-class as you perform it, do it with all the genius, strength and enthusiasm you have within you. and when you’re not working, lead a quiet, thoughtful, honorable, and meaningful life. because making a great living must never prevent you from constructing a gorgeous life. oceanofpdf.com the th form of wealth money the prosperity as"

this makes me think of a fascinating story that appeared in an issue of the new yorker . famed authors joseph heller and kurt vonnegut were at a cocktail party at the home of a wall street titan on long island. it was glamorous, filled with socialites and glittered with excess. vonnegut asked his friend, “joe, how does it feel to know that our host made more money yesterday than you’ll make from all your royalties for catch- ?” heller replied, “well, kurt, i have something he’ll never have.” “what’s that?” his friend inquired. “the feeling of enough,” was the simple response. the feeling of enough. beautiful. to know the fulfillment of being satisfied with what you have makes you wealthy. having said this, encouraging yourself to acquire reasonable financial riches is necessary to live your finest life. economic prosperity allows you the liberty to make the choices that are in your best interests rather than being forced into a corner, having to do things you don’t want to do but have to do because you need the paycheck. money abundance also provides you and your loved ones with easier circumstances, and the opportunity to enjoy the wonderful pleasures that the material world offers. it’s really a balance, isn’t it? own your cash rather than letting it own you. let a sensible amount of affluence serve you so you experience a marvelous lifestyle. yet never allow money to become your master. ever. with this context, let us begin our journey through the lessons i have carefully prepared for you to significantly increase the fifth of the eight forms of wealth—money—in your valuable life. shall we begin? oceanofpdf.com avoid the howard hughes money trap last night, i watched an alternately inspiring and shocking documentary on howard hughes, a man who—in his era—was one of the planet’s richest people. it struck me as a good place to begin our discussion of the fifth form of wealth. “why?” you wonder. allow me to explain. … he made fifty million dollars a year (equivalent to one hundred and fifty million now) from his tool company. … he sold twa stock (from his airline) for half a billion in cash (back in ). … he pioneered new planes as a master aviator and launched an innovative hollywood studio. … he even invented the automatic hospital bed after being frustrated by having to lie flat constantly after suffering severe injuries in a plane crash. here’s the thing, though. while he was super rich, his later years were spent alone, in a near-always-dark penthouse of a hotel in las vegas. no family around him, struggling with drug addiction and poor health, suffering from the lack of any real enjoyment of the gift that is a human life. hughes was so powerful, so unreachable in a way, that he was isolated from anyone who could have spoken truth to him—and helped him reconnect with reality. top managers around him shielded the mogul from the serious challenges that were unfolding within his empire. and his personal demons ensured that while he had all the money in the world he lived as a hermit locked in his lavish yet filthy hotel suite. as the complexity of his operations grew, he attracted people who didn’t always have his best interests in mind, and failed to ensure that he got appropriate treatment for his mental health struggles. as things declined, he spent his days naked—refusing to bathe, terrified of germs, and frightened of other people. he was left in the shadows, with needles in his arms for long stretches of time. a very sad ending to an exceptional man’s life. let’s be clear: the making of money is not an evil pursuit. money really can make your lifestyle so much easier and solve many problems. money can allow you to do so much good for your family and enrich your community. many of the famous (but quiet) billionaires i’ve advised over all these decades are some of the most high-integrity, generous, and kind people i’ve met, sincerely working to be sure that they are making the world significantly better. i guess what i’m really suggesting to you—my steadily growing friend—is simply that as you increase your financial wealth, please be careful to make certain it becomes a gateway into goodness instead of a prison that destroys your happiness. oceanofpdf.com know your scarcity scars making money to grow the fifth form of wealth is not an accident. instead, the accumulation of financial prosperity happens through the conscious and consistent application of a set of time-tested rules that those who have money know, use, and optimize. a wise starting point to upgrade your economic abundance is to heal your money wounds. these are the false beliefs and emotional injuries that have been formed as you’ve advanced through your life. especially in our youth, we adopt the thinking of our parents and early teachers on money (remember the five forces of penam that i walked you through much earlier in our time together?). and as we grow older, we experience disappointments, trials, and losses in this area that close us to possibilities, limit us from welcoming opportunity, and cause us to become cynical about our"
sharma,"potential to be a financial force on the planet (or at least to be free of daily money stresses). perhaps you have been taught by those you trust that “rich people are thieves,” that “the wealthy are different from us,” that “money is the root of all evil” or that “those with plenty of funds just got lucky.” or maybe you were told that “investing in the stock market is gambling” (it only is if you don’t know how to assess the value of a company and so take shots in the dark) or that “buying foreign real estate is foolish” (it only is if your purchase is an uninformed one). if you have these beliefs, do you really think you’ll have the ambition to learn and then apply the rules that will bring your highest money potential to life? the core beliefs you hold very much do become self-fulfilling prophecies. human beings get what they expect. today, i strongly encourage you to start the process of healing your financial wealth wounds. so you fully get to enjoy all of the benefits this type of currency brings. here are four proven practices to help you wire in the mentality of prosperity and the emotionality of a healthier relationship with your income: . treat yourself like visiting royalty. i’m in no way suggesting that you go out and purchase something you cannot afford. i’m a huge fan of being frugal. yet i am sure there are some actions you could take immediately to celebrate all you’ve become and to reward yourself for all you’ve overcome. ideas include having a simple ceremony where you find a quiet, beautiful place to honor all the skills you’ve developed and all the value you’ve created for others (recall that money is the by-product of value delivered to your marketplace), or having a massage at a top spa, or taking the trip you’ve always longed to take, or investing in a piece of original art from an unknown yet superb local artist that you joyfully hang in your home. i’m inviting you to do something—anything—to appreciate yourself for all you’ve grown into because this will increase what i call in my mentoring work deserveability. here’s the principle: as you treat yourself better, you’ll naturally feel you deserve better. this, in turn, will cause you to seize more excellent opportunities, push better work into your field, and raise the fees you ask clients to pay (and fire the ones who steal your joy). as you continue to elevate your personal appreciation, you’ll raise your standards around the quality of your daily habits, your physical fitness, the amounts you ask for in negotiations, the goodness of the content you consume, the caliber of your friendships, and the specialness of the places you go to. yes, increasing your self-worth leads to an inevitable rise in your net worth. money doesn’t like people who don’t love themselves. . visit super-rich places. the next principle here can be stated easily: prosperity is an energy, so be around its vitality. you have to do this carefully, yet being around luxury will increase and then normalize your confidence to build more prosperity in your life. deep within, you’ll know you just belong in such high-end places. and soon you’ll automatically start creating the mastery that will make this lifestyle real. income always reflects identity (read that twice) . this might initially simply look like enjoying a cup of tea at the café of an ultra-chic department store or having a salad at the restaurant of the most exquisite hotel in your city. by placing yourself in such environments, you’ll hear the conversations of people with prosperity. you’ll be in a position to make new connections. and your perception of yourself along with your honoring of your talents will subtly and progressively begin to shift. trust me on this, please. money really is a strong reflection of the way you see yourself. as you start to view yourself as a much more prosperous person, you’ll begin doing the things prosperous people do. which will certainly make you more money. . do a scarcity inventory. in your morning journal, list all the mind programs your parents, your teachers, and the media have taught you about the negativity of making, cultivating, and protecting money. also record your wealth wounds: those hurts that happened when you tried to grow your prosperity and it didn’t work out. writing all this down will bring the causes that have limited your economic progress into sharper focus and out into the open where you can see how they have been sabotaging your winning in this fifth form of wealth. shadows brought into the light dissolve and awareness precedes transformation. as maya angelou advised, “do the best you can until you know better. then, when you know better, do better.” . create your ideal life collage. you know i’m very much an evangelist for execution. no idea works for someone unwilling to do any work. and excellent things unfold for people who do excellent things. having said this, clarity breeds mastery and you need to do the up-front thinking to know what you want before you take the action to bring it to life. how can you get what you desire if you have no clue what you need? vague plans lead to vague performance. definitely don’t invest your best years climbing mountains that, at the end, turn out to be the wrong ones. so start the process of reprogramming, upgrading and then electrifying your mind to focus purely on the rich lifestyle you seek. one superb tool to do this is a dream collage on a large board that you will see daily. this collage contains pictures of the majestic life you’ll experience once you have made the financial wealth to enjoy it. the images may be of a home that you’d like to live in with your loved ones, tropical islands or ski resorts where you hope to vacation, cars"
sharma,"you wish to own, clothes you want to wear, top restaurants you aspire to visit, super-fun adventures you’d like to take, and charities you’re set to serve. again, the key here is to enjoy material things (because we do live in a material world), yet never to need the things you own. and to avoid defining yourself by your possessions. okay. it’s autumn at the old farmhouse and the colors are pretty breathtaking. if you were here with me—maybe having a cup of fresh mint tea—i think you’d agree. although i don’t ride my mountain bike like a wild man, as i used to when i was younger, i’ll hit the trails now. for a gentle spin. let’s talk later. bye. oceanofpdf.com your vitality serves you financially just about every one of the money masters i’ve been around is extremely fit. they work out most mornings, walk a lot (and adore walking meetings), invest in the best exercise machines, and have personal trainers, massage therapists, and nutritionists. they profoundly understand that one of the great keys to legendary prosperity is developing limitless energy. many of the ones i’ve mentored meditate, monitor the quality of their sleep to optimize it, take ice baths, sweat daily in hot saunas, breathe fresh air regularly, and go to longevity clinics to, well, extend their longevity. (pro tip: if you’re seriously serious about living your richest life, don’t die. ) you might wonder when they find the time to work. well, such souls are usually minimalists: they say no to most activities so they can get to the highest level on only a few. they are essentialists versus maximalists, if you get my drift. even more importantly, they profoundly understand that money invested in arriving at their finest health and peak vitality is absolutely necessary for their financial mastery. they get that mission number one to reach the summit of economic prosperity is not to get sick. sure, all the things they do that i’ve listed cost money. but disease costs you more. more healthy equals more energy. more energy means greater productivity. more productivity results in superior value sent out into your industry. and the natural reply of the marketplace to humans who create splendid products and services that make the lives of others better is higher income. if you and i were sitting together in person in my library in front of a roaring fire, i’d draw a model from my mentoring methodology on another napkin that would sort of look like this: yes, elevating your health raises the vitality that drives your productivity and that boosts value delivery into the economy, which results in you enjoying greater prosperity. oh, and if you lengthen your lifespan by ten or twenty years by installing the correct habits of health, just think about how many more people you will enrich. which makes me think about how much more money you’ll make as a result of this extended helpfulness. as i once heard iconic billionaire ted turner say, “he profits most who serves best.” wisdom. oceanofpdf.com the top move of money masters one of the prime habits for success in the fifth form of wealth, after increasing your health and energy, is to think for yourself. this is a main driver of the victory experienced by financial empire-makers. these people don’t mind being ridiculed for the sake of remaining true to their instincts, intuitions, and brave vision for a better future. actually, they take the stones their critics throw at them and make them into movements that stand as testimony to their audacity. our current culture is one where the majority of us follow the crowd, model ourselves on what influencers do (and buy, eat and say), and operate as we are told to operate. too many among us are becoming more obedient “sheeple” versus stronger and wiser people. last week i read a review of a book on creativity written by a star music producer. the critic was highly attacking of the work, because that’s what critics do (if they had the talent and guts to do the work they are condemning, they would have done it!). … he said that the book wasn’t much of a memoir (yet it wasn’t meant to be a memoir). … he wrote that the book didn’t share many anecdotes of the producer’s experiences in the studio with the musical superstars he worked with (it wasn’t meant to be about that; it’s a sharing of his insights on the creative process). … he noted that the book didn’t deliver much value and suggested it wasn’t worth buying. after reviewing the review, i looked at the online comments. “thanks for the helpful review. you saved me from having to buy this book,” said one. hmmm. i have heard only good things about the impact of this übercreative man, who is more of an artist than a producer. and because i’m beyond fascinated by how artists upgrade their game and make work that mesmerizes others, i quickly purchased the audiobook, regardless of the negativity surrounding it. guess what? it’s one of the finest, most helpful, and truly thoughtful guides for leveraging human creativity and releasing masterwork that i have ever read. the lesson for us is this: think for yourself . i honestly doubt that the critic even read the book from beginning to end. seriously. (by the way, that reminds me of yet another thing that billionaires do: they go deep rather than wide, and granular on anything they decide to win at, instead of superficial and light.) and i’m fairly sure the critic is not a serious creative, because i don’t think he understood what the author was saying. it makes me remember what bob dylan once advised: “don’t criticize what you can’t understand.” your takeaway from this chapter: because those who commented took what they read in the review as gospel (without thinking for themselves), they missed out on learning ideas and tools that would have helped them"
sharma,"maximize their artistry, exponentially. one even said, “you don’t need a book to learn how to express your creativity. you just need to do it.” really? how silly. as if the hard-earned wisdom written by a human being who has been working the craft for decades—at the highest grade on the planet—cannot be helpful to avoid mistakes, shorten the expertise curve, and provoke one’s imagination to accomplish things that were previously viewed as impossible. trust your own opinions. and fortify your faith for your exciting mission, along with protecting your honest inclinations—even if the entire tribe is laughing at you. every visionary is initially ridiculed, before they are revered. oceanofpdf.com the multibillionaire in the very empty mansion a few years ago, my team received a request from a celebrated entrepreneurial icon. he wanted me to help him add another zero or two to his fortune while getting his health back to good and finding more joy, peace, and freedom in his ridiculously complicated life. after deeply considering the request for a few weeks, i agreed to meet the tycoon. i flew many hours to his home city in a distant country, checked into my hotel, and reviewed my preparation notes so i would be on my game when i met him. (another pro tip: always be the most prepared person in every room you’re in—because if you’re not overprepared you’re not prepared.) i hopped into a cab, which led me past famous buildings, along tree-lined boulevards and up to an area that appeared to be populated with embassies, sprawling estates, and gargantuan mansions. the taxi pulled up to one of the largest, grandest, and most sensational homes i’ve ever seen. an aide met me at the soaring wrought-iron gates and walked me past fragrant flower gardens, elaborate outdoor sculptures by renowned artists, and a series of architecturally stunning guest cottages. eventually, we arrived at the main house in the primary area of the expansive compound. the assistant opened the front door, walked me through the marble foyer and through a living room where clearly priceless paintings hung on the walls, fabulous oriental rugs covered the floors, and custom-designed furniture held stacks and stacks of business books. we traveled along a long hallway, down a set of stairs and into what appeared to be an underground complex. a glass wall revealed a garage filled with ferraris and lamborghinis and bugattis. to the left was another hallway that led us to a metal door. i could smell cigar smoke. “he’s inside waiting for you, mr. sharma,” said the right hand. “he’s in a good mood today so you will enjoy your meeting very much. he’s really been looking forward to seeing you.” the door opened, revealing a huge office with a wide reclaimed-wood table in the center, with neat piles of paper organized across it. floor-to-ceiling shelves held yet more books. “for whom the bell tolls” by metallica was playing. yes, metallica was playing. a long cigar puff. smoke filled the space. the client was in his early s and sported a black hoodie, black sweatpants, and a black baseball cap over his wavy brown hair. on one wrist was a big stainless steel watch and on the other was a series of thin red strings. though he was relatively young, he looked old. weary. and very much out of shape. the renowned billionaire and i chatted for more than three hours. i asked a ton of questions and took pages and pages of notes. i inquired about his current life, his largest triumphs, and his deepest sufferings. i examined his hopes and dreams. i probed him on his entertainment empire and his various investments. i gently questioned him on his morning routine, work rituals, pre-sleep structure, and overall lifestyle. then i said, “please tell me about your family.” my research hadn’t been able to reveal much about the magnate’s personal life and my guess is that his business team had been instructed to scrub the internet of all details. for whatever reason. a long pause. another long puff on the cigar. “no one.” “what do you mean?” i replied. “you must have some people you care about and people who care about you. you don’t live here at this complex alone, do you?” “yep,” was the straightforward reply. “it’s just me here. and my team of assistants. no family. no real friends. pretty much alone.” he looked away. i heard a sigh. i won’t reveal anything further of this meeting. and i share it only to reinforce a cautionary tale: many with a lot of money are actually stuck in poverty. there are many incredibly important things that money—which, after all is only one form of the eight forms of wealth—can’t buy. having enough is certainly important and that’s why i’m walking you through this section. but in an age when society generally measures worldly success solely by the size of someone’s bank account and the wealth in their stock portfolio, i’m humbly and gently reminding you that there’s no point in devoting your life to scaling this seemingly satisfying summit only to reach the top completely alone. and fully empty. oceanofpdf.com grateful is a money printer it’s a sunny day on the farm. i see vineyards in the distance, hear dogs barking and am uplifted by the birdsong that i hear through the window of my writing room. not sure why but in this era of so much complexity, birds singing make me happy. all right. let’s get into this next lesson with this idea: you’ll see more of what you focus on in your life. what you pay attention to is an amplifier and what you center your mind upon is a maximizer. so don’t keep ruminating about what’s not working when you have the choice to obsess on what’s great today. which brings us even deeper into the importance of gratefulness. gratitude is the antidote to fear, you know. and a gateway practice into prosperity. when you’re wallowing"
sharma,"in scarcity and restricted by insecurity because you’re worried about things and catastrophizing over your future, you miss opportunities, degrade your productivity, and fail to incubate the ideas that could make you your fortune. from a metaphysical viewpoint, not giving thanks for the gifts you have tells the universe you’re not appreciative for all the blessings in your life, which blocks the flow of more. what you appreciate appreciates in value and what you celebrate escalates your delight. so—as simple as it sounds—while pink’s uplifting tune “cover me in sunshine” plays in my messy writing room (with my faithful dog next to me), i suggest you count your gifts. turn (and train) your perception to those things that increase your joy and make you feel safe, good, and successful. the energy of this positivity will allow more money to flood into your life. yes, it most certainly will. oceanofpdf.com see another’s winning as your victory financial freedom is rarely found by jealous people. there, i said it. jealousy is a thought (and heart) poison that ruins your creativity, pollutes your productivity, minimizes your bravery, and keeps you from growing into the highest version of your finest vision. the time you spend feeling animosity for someone else’s victories steals time you might have spent producing your own. it’s just a completely unuseful habit. and one that is unworthy of your rich, great and noble character. “so, robin, how do i stop being jealous of the good fortune of others?” you may courageously ask. “just stop,” i’d gently yet firmly say. … stop scrolling to see what others are doing and what they are accomplishing. … stop comparing yourself to influencers and stand up for your own your uniqueness, giftedness, and specialness. there are talents you have that the people you admire only dream of having. … stop wanting what you see another possessing because maybe the wisdom that rules the world knows something you don’t and has decided that what you want isn’t best for you. i guess what i’m really trying to tell you—with a ton of love and respect—is what’s right for you is coming to you and what’s not yours won’t be yours. so why would you want it? and, even more importantly, start practicing the fantastic habit of feeling happy at the sign of someone else’s accomplishment, triumph, and winning. with focus and steady effort (we get better at what we practice, right?), within only a few weeks you’ll make good gains in reprogramming and restructuring your inner architecture to become a nonjealous person, who operates in a way that causes great experiences to come your way too. last thought to consider here: if someone’s jealous of you, it’s because they think you’re better than them. and have the life they secretly want. oceanofpdf.com remember the habits beat iq slogan top habits are more valuable to financial riches than off-the-chart intelligence, every day of the week. memorize that brain tattoo, sing it in the streets and then shout that slogan from the rooftops. because it’s incredibly important. actually—and i’m going out on a limb here—many of the multibillionaires i’ve mentored are not the smartest people on the planet. they are bright, for sure, but not more than the average person. in my experience, being too smart and too academic and too well-educated causes one to overthink things. and to accept only what the status quo says is reasonable. yet all inventions, innovations, and advancements came from a creator who thought (and then did) the impossible. remember roger bannister, the runner? everyone said no human being could run a mile in under four minutes. and if they did, it was believed, their body would explode. the runner would likely die. but bannister was a possibilitarian. so he did his daily training, ate properly, rested well, studied his sport, remained positive and then ran his best race, breaking the barrier. interestingly, within weeks of his showing what was possible, others started running the mile in under four minutes. makes me recall one of my favorite quotes, from the irish playwright george bernard shaw: “the reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.” anyway, my main point is that the great men and women who have created rich financial fortunes are not those with the highest iqs but the finest habits. install excellent ones into your days. and spend some time now reflecting on this rule that the most precise way to improve your money future is to enrich the routines you’re running today. oceanofpdf.com use wealth words i’d like to say more on the power of the words you use, in this mentoring session together. the words we speak carry such influence and have such energy. too many good souls among us are too loose with their vocabulary. and trust me, this seriously reduces their prosperity. in my leadership presentations, i always talk about the supreme power of words. i start by reminding my audience to strip gossip out of their communications and to completely avoid saying bad things about other people as, at some level, they can sense it. as well, when you speak poorly about others, be certain they’ll be speaking poorly about you. then i say to my audiences, “use leadertalk versus victimspeak.” deploy weak words and not only will your performance be reduced, you’ll push all those around you—who could help you accomplish your mighty mission and ethical ambitions—away from you because no one is attracted to negativity, apathy, and toxicity. as always, the beginning of transformation is to increase your awareness around the quality of your language. as you become clearer on the low-quality words you send out into the universe, you can begin to make those all-important micro-improvements to raise your communication skills to the next level of mastery. small, daily, seemingly insignificant optimizations—when done consistently over time—really do lead to stunning results! to"

he was gracious, humble, and interesting. the gentleman was an excellent listener, a rich thinker, and a person who had clearly spent a lot of time calibrating his personal philosophy on the way he wanted to show up and operate in the world. when i asked him, “what’s your best financial advice?” he responded quickly: “no leverage.” (yes, i get this is contrary to the common advice that others will give you around using opm—other people’s money—to grow your fortune. there are many ways to build financial freedom and nothing in life is black and white, is it?) he went on to explain that “an investor’s best friend is time.” time allows money to compound over a long horizon. and as you know, compounding can cause exponential growth in your wealth when you have the discipline to wait and wait and wait. “but if you have borrowed money, a time might come when the bank becomes a wolf at your door, wanting their money back. which means you won’t get the benefits of compounding. so it’s smart to live below your means and invest without any leverage.” we all know we should do it, yet it’s a rule that’s generally practiced in the breach. i’m reminded of investment guru warren buffett’s wisdom on the danger of too much debt: “only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s been swimming naked.” a client who founded a top hedge fund once shared a money insight that remains with me to this moment: “the real reason most people don’t get ahead financially is that as they increase their income, they also increase their lifestyle costs. they make more money and then, rather than using a relatively small amount on their lifestyle and investing the rest intelligently, they use the extra money to buy into a neighborhood where wealthier people live. this then puts pressure on them to buy the cars their neighbors have, vacation on the caribbean islands their community goes to for vacations, and send their kids to the same incredibly expensive schools the people next door send their children to. so, at the end of each year, they are still left with nothing to save and invest. often, though they are growing in income, they end up deeper into debt.” so before you rush to make your next purchase, practice a tool that i call t he hour temptation reducer . sleep on the buy. wait twenty-four hours and then see how you feel about the purchase. more often than not, the temptation will vanish. your impulse to get what you wanted in that moment will have dissolved. and your more sensible (and responsible) thinking will have returned, saving you money (a ton over time). so many poor money decisions are made by people who were tired (or bored or angry or hungry) when they made them. and definitely do ensure that you live beneath your means so you can wisely invest your money in sensible things versus the shiny toys that you’ll regret owning in the future. the entire multibillion-dollar storage business has been created because so many of us buy far more than we need. reduce your wants—and instead simply serve your needs —and just watch the bounty that flows. buying less also reduces waste on the planet so you’re doing good for mother earth (and the happiness of future generations). “the"
sharma,"way to wealth depends chiefly on two words: industry and frugality; that is, waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.” this is advice from the writer, inventor, statesman, and philosopher benjamin franklin (read his autobiography, by the way; it’s one of the best books in my library). it’s advice worth memorizing. oceanofpdf.com the habit stack of super-wealthy people super-wealthy people have the following nine habits in common, in addition to the ones i’ve already mentioned: habit #: monomaniacal focus. at a time when the majority is suffering from broken focus syndrome, the money moguls have developed the magnificent ability to concentrate almost completely on the near-flawless execution of the few projects that will make their ethical ambitions real. when they work, they do real work versus fake work and understand the uselessness of being busy being busy. and wasting hours of their finest days mindlessly browsing online or following trivial pursuits. habit #: undefeatable positivity. finacial titans are unbreakable optimists. they value a better world because of their innovations and hope for a richer future because of their inventions. they are masters of entrepreneurship instead of entitlement, really believing that their creativity, productivity, teamwork, and contributions to their industry are dramatically more essential to their success than having a fortunate destiny or getting lucky. habit #: unique unorthodoxy. they really do see what we all see, yet think what few dare. they avoid the attraction to copying. such individuals are profoundly imaginative, dreaming up extraordinary plans for new ventures that disrupt existing enterprises and deliver fresh benefits to millions of consumers. they know that unless they are being called crazy a lot they are not dreaming big enough. and they pretty much couldn’t care less about the disapproval of others. habit #: extreme resolve. they stay with their high-value targets through the storms of criticism, the attacks of vicious critics, and the aching bouts of self-doubt. much like that dog with a bone, these movement-makers have habituated (by training) the traits of resilience and persistence and the superhuman determination to finish what they start. billionaires have built the ability to take great pain. and keep on going forever . habit #: intelligent risk-taking. magnates are not at all foolish when it comes to seizing opportunity and maximizing victory. not at all. instead, they are masters of “hedged risk-taking.” they take risks that have a very high chance of turning into massive wins. a key here is to remember “no ask, no get” and “zero risk, zero reward.” habit #: managed perfectionism. yes—these souls are mostly absolute perfectionists. if they are founders of a hotel chain they just might delay the opening of a new property for two months if the marble they ordered for the restaurant is not the precise color. if they are a tech company founder they’ll insist on getting the product to mona lisa–level exquisiteness before it’s released (steve jobs wanted the icons on the iphone to be so magical users would want to lick the screen). if they are entertainment virtuosos they’ll be relentless in making sure that their film or album is astonishingly well made, no matter how much they have to suffer to get the job done. habit #: leader building. great leaders build more leaders. (read that twice, please, because if you’re not growing more leaders then you’re not really leading, just following.) one of the top ways financial sovereigns scale their fortunes is by exploiting leverage . and that’s not only leveraging in terms of “good debt”; what i really mean is leverage through the honest development of leadership talent of the people around you. as you grow more leaders who can execute on your mighty mission with military-like mastery, you’re freed up to do only what you do best (and love most). you just can’t do it alone. and the greater your dream, the more important it becomes to build a world-class team. habit #: solution orientation. many people focus on the problem in front of them instead of the solution waiting to find them. ( every problem carries with it a solution, even if you can’t see it right away.) this trait is due to the negativity bias of the human brain we explored earlier in our time together, a trait that served us well tens of thousands of years ago when each day provided deadly threats of starvation, or attack by animals or warring tribes. money masters have patiently programmed themselves, through consistent daily practice, to constantly look for the opportunity within each difficulty and the solution inside every challenge. do remember that a problem only becomes a problem when viewed as a problem. habit #: sustained helpfulness. you now know well that money is the reward delivered for usefulness rendered. barons pick businesses that raise the lives of billions of human beings. which, in turn, makes them billions in income. it’s very hard to have economic prosperity when you select an opportunity that offers little chance of impact. okay. hope my sharing of these nine traits of top moguls is useful to your growth. i’ll end this longer than usual chapter here as i promised my parents i’d call them. so i need to go call them. let’s talk later. oceanofpdf.com develop the doubling discipline another quality of the tycoons i advise is their near obsession with doubling their money as quickly as possible. when they consider a new opportunity, one of the first questions they ask is, “how great is the risk and how high is the upside, so i can, at the very least, double my capital?” in financial circles, this kind of thinking is known as the rule of , which says that at a return of percent, it will take approximately seven years to double your money. you see, the majority of people work for their money, trading their hours for income. but fortune-makers are very much about participating in projects that allow them to make money while they"
sharma,"sleep. and compound massively over time. definitely understand this as it’s incredibly important— they make their cash work for them . (the habit is sometimes called the swiss method: sales while i sleep soundly.) financially rich humans first learn the skill of making money and then the separate skill of multiplying that money by applying the doubling discipline. for example, under the rule of , $, turns into $, in roughly seven years at a rate of percent, $, after fourteen years, $, after twenty-one years, $. million after twenty-eight years, $. million after thirty-five years, $. million after forty-two years, and so on, without any of your effort invested. you just sleep sweetly. and dream soundly. finally, money superstars exercise the third and completely different skill of protecting their financial wealth. it’s one thing to make it and another thing to grow it and yet another thing to ensure you don’t lose it. without each of these three capabilities, they would never be where they are. i’ll leave you with these words of comedian steve martin: i love money. i love everything about it. i bought some pretty good stuff. got a fur sink. an electric dog polisher. a gasoline powered turtleneck sweater. and, of course, i bought some dumb stuff too. oceanofpdf.com translate video-watching into fortune-making here’s a simple yet powerful idea to seriously raise the level of your prosperity in the fifth form of wealth: take most of the daily hours you spend watching online videos of little value and turn them into productivity that creates deep value for other human beings. this could mean you use the time to read so you increase the knowledge and expertise you bring to your marketplace. perhaps you’ll apply this freed-up time to write more about your heroic ideals, most exciting goals and vividly imagined lifestyle in your journal. or maybe you’ll use the time you’d waste to turn up your fitness, pursue an extraordinary passion, or build better relationships. you could deploy these extra hours to teach an online course on a subject you love (that just might end up helping hordes of people across the planet), make an app that disrupts an entire industry, launch a start-up that ignites a movement, or write a screenplay that delights humanity. someone will do it, so why not you? and if not now, then when? even better, you could use the time you spent fooling around to go for a nature walk with your significant other, reach out to your parents, or have an interesting conversation with a lifetime friend. life passes in a blink. and the time we waste we never get back. sure, playing with our digital devices can be fun now and then. yet making your life gorgeous, prosperous, and honestly rich while you contribute to the welfare of the world is an even more joy-filled game. oceanofpdf.com why do it if it doesn’t make you happy? please don’t send me a message that says, “life is hard and it’s easy for you and we have bills to pay and it’s impossible to live life the way you suggest.” i get that life can be hard. i’ve suffered a lot more than you know. and although it might surprise you, i too have bills to pay, a ton of obligations to fulfill, and more on my weary shoulders than you may imagine. all i’m trying to say during this session is: why do something if you don’t love it? i used to deliver speaking presentations for fortune clients across the globe that lasted an entire day. toured the world, talking about leadership and mastering change and growing teams of top-performing leaders without titles at every level of the organization, in big stadiums—for years. then i reached a place where those long hours on the platform stopped being fun. i actually started to dread having to present long into the afternoon, after a morning start. one day over a long lunch in the sunshine of new york city, a friend said to me: “so why not build the rest of your speaking career around only doing the things you want to do?” game-changer. life-shifting moment. radical, simple, and very beautiful insight. and so i did. (you have more power than you know and more choices than you think, even if you currently think you don’t.) i stopped accepting full-day invitations and returned to my true love: seventy-five-minute keynotes. the result? by declining percent of incoming requests, i got my joy back. and guess what? rather than losing invitations, far more requests came in. i did the same thing in other areas of my business. … i refused to work with people who drained my energy. … i released suppliers who made excuses, brought me problems, and overpromised yet underdelivered. … i avoided each and every pursuit that stained my happiness. the fantastic and somewhat bizarre consequence of doing only that which fueled my joy (and that i was best at)? our enterprise grew. i attracted an even higher grade of client. new teammates who wanted to show up at mastery, operate with creativity, and join our mission to make our precious world a far more splendid place pounded on our doors. my personal life dramatically increased in inspiration, enthusiasm, and freedom. the valuable lesson for you? create your career on your terms. your days are too numbered to be unhappy. oceanofpdf.com recruit a dead board of directors none of us can do it alone. elite athletes all have coaches for a reason: to push them beyond their common limits so they achieve peak results. the first known use of the word “coach” as a guide can be found at oxford university around and was slang for a tutor who carried a student (like in a horse-drawn coach) through a subject. and so, a coach is someone who transports an individual from a starting point in their learning to the place they wish to arrive. a good one will encourage"
sharma,"you to continue when you feel like stopping, save you time by showing you shortcuts to reach your goal, and hold you accountable so you don’t come up with alibis for not doing the things you promised you’d do. of course, an excellent mentor comes with costs. and if you’re in a situation where your budget doesn’t allow for this monetary investment, i have a solution: instead of working with a life coach, seek a dead one. yes, i’m serious. i’ve had so many long-since-gone teachers who helped me profoundly that i can’t remember them all. for years, i studied at the feet of nelson mandela for instruction on daily heroism, roman emperor marcus aurelius for lifelong wisdom, mother teresa for guidance on servant leadership, william shakespeare on craftsmanship, benjamin franklin on character building, amelia earhart on courage, the spartan king leonidas for turning trouble into triumph, michelangelo for advice on artistry, isaac asimov for getting big things done (he wrote five hundred books in his lifetime, so i’m only an amateur), and florence scovel shinn, joseph murphy, maxwell maltz, and kahlil gibran for their counsel on metaphysics and spirituality. these individuals, and a vast array of other great human beings, have been for me a sort of quiet board of advisors, through the insights offered in their memoirs or autobiographies, or in books inspired by their well-lived lives. may i gently suggest you find your dead board of directors too. oceanofpdf.com sit for rich ideas in his valuable classic, think and grow rich , author napoleon hill writes about an inventor who had an unusual practice that brought him a fortune. the man had set up a room where he would go to “sit for ideas.” the room was sparse, containing only a table and a chair. the lights would be turned off and the inventor would enter the room, close his eyes and then wait for his creative intelligence to send him solutions to the biggest problems that he was trying to solve through his inventions. in a time where so few of us are ever solitary (and even when we are, we are still with our phones), be one of those remarkable people who embrace the power of being alone and quiet. go to your place of peace. shut the door. turn off the lights. and sit for the ideas that will allow you to bring great solutions to people’s pressing problems. your creativity and ingenuity will be rewarded nicely. makes me think of what french mathematician blaise pascal once said: “ all of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” good, right? oceanofpdf.com bless your money daily i woke up later than usual this morning. none of that am club stuff! my recent workouts have been harder, so i needed more rest. and—of course—that’s okay. just don’t fall into the trap of confusing laziness with recovery. but allow me to get to the point. a few years back, in a dusty ancient bookshop in central london, i found a book called bring out the magic in your mind . it was written many years ago by a man named al koran, who was then known as “the finest mental magician in the world.” in a chapter called “the secret of wealth,” he writes the following: when you send your money out, remember always to bless it. ask it to bless everybody that it touches, and command it to go out and feed the hungry and clothe the naked and command it to come back to you one million-fold. don’t pass over this lightly. over the next few days, why not apply this author’s strange yet fascinating advice? and see what happens. when you pay for your groceries, silently bless all those who have helped bring this food to you: the farmers who have grown it, the laborers who have picked it, the truckers who have transported it, and the cashiers who have sold it. if you’re writing a check for car repairs, why not give silent appreciation to all the factory workers who made the part, the delivery people who carried it, and the mechanics who got your car working again? when you buy a book from a bookstore, bless the bookseller, and when you enjoy a cup of coffee, glorify the barista. you get my drift. just become an unlimited, highly enthusiastic gratefulness spreader. to uplift lives. and to increase your wealth. as the timeless truth teaches us, the hand that gives, gathers. oceanofpdf.com being good is good business yesterday i delivered a keynote for an enthusiastic group of eleven thousand top leaders in são paulo. i spoke about the importance of leveraging high-velocity change for exponential success. i shared that the bigger the dream, the more essential the team. i noted that the best leaders grow more leaders and are servant heroes, putting the growth and welfare of their people above the needs of their egos. and i offered the idea that the wiser, braver, healthier, and more decent we make ourselves as people, the more superb will be our results in business. because what happens within determines what unfolds without. and to change the world we must start by improving ourselves. a very polite and well-dressed man in a crisp gray suit with black shoes that shone like a perfect summer day came up to me after the presentation and asked if i had a few minutes to answer a question. “sure, how can i help?” i replied. “private equity has invested in my company. i need to grow profits quickly to keep them happy. i like your idea of acting in a way that’s good for society as well as good for our firm, what you said about ‘linking paycheck to purpose’ and how world-class leaders ‘find a cause that’s larger than themselves.’ yet it’s not really practical. i’m sorry to say this to you, robin.” hmmm. being a person of vast integrity, impeccable honesty, strong"
sharma,"character virtues, and a noble heart isn’t just good for your soul. it’s absolutely fantastic for the economic engine of your business. actually, i can’t think of a better competitive advantage than being someone whom people deeply respect and totally trust. being good is good business. and excellent things happen to leaders who do excellent things. being the kind of person who viscerally believes in your crusade and will do whatever it takes to take wonderful care of the people around you—while helping the dreams of your customers come true—will pretty much guarantee that your reputation will rise, your team will remain loyal, and your customers will shift from regular clients to fanatical followers . who are so inspired and delighted by you and your team they tell everyone they know about what you do. of course, this will increase the bottom line. dramatically . the gentleman’s comment contained an assumption: that working with less ego, more honor, and greater devotion to benefiting others would decrease the money he’d make. wrong. just the opposite is the truth. serving with magnificence, grace, mastery, and dignity will make him rich, financially as well as spiritually. leading with caring, authenticity, decency, and love (there, i said it!) causes your team, customers, suppliers and investors to fall in love with you. and to do whatever they can to protect you. people do business with people they like. humans give business to people they trust. and all of us want to offer our loyalty to individuals who make us feel special. i mentioned much of this to the man at my leadership presentation. he nodded sincerely. i’m not sure he totally agreed with me. then he shook my hand and walked off into the dense crowd. oceanofpdf.com be a highly humble leader the thing about a master is they always think they are an apprentice. and the thing about a professional is they keep the mindset of an amateur, always hungry to learn, improve, and evolve. we visited this concept before. yet it’s essential that i reinforce it for you. so that you remember it, after our time together is over. becoming an expert in your field is dangerous. why? for the reason that experts fall into the trap of believing they know everything. they develop a huge sense of pride in all they know. so they stop being willing to change their minds. so they stop studying, preparing, working, innovating, and optimizing. so they rest on their laurels and think that because they’re at the top they’ll automatically remain at the top. this arrogance is the beginning of their end. i encourage you to do whatever it takes to insulate your humbleness as you rise in the success that will attract more money to you. humility is necessary for enduring mastery. and the greatest leaders don’t think too much of themselves. i’m not at all saying not to have high self-worth. i’m just saying—in this culture of too many people tooting their own horns and trumpeting their own genius—be quiet. and stay open. now, you might not think you’re a leader, but in fact you very much are. years ago, i wrote a book called the leader who had no title . really, you can lead without a position, influence without an office, and impact without formal authority. when one of my kids was little, i asked them what it meant to be a leader. the reply was unforgettable: “dad, at school, when we all have to walk to the playground, the person at the front of the line is the leader. but the cool thing is that every day, someone new gets to stand at the front of the line. so everyone in the class gets their turn to be a leader.” but leading without a title isn’t the main point of this mentoring message. my key here is to gently remind you to be humble in the skills you pursue, work you do and life you make. because the humblest is the greatest. which brings me to a story i’ve never forgotten about konosuke matsushita, the founder of panasonic, the global electronics company. one day, he was set to have a meal at a steak restaurant in the heart of tokyo. the staff at the restaurant were on high alert and their best behavior, knowing that one of the icons of japanese business would be visiting their place. with the eyes of everyone in the room on him, the luminary of industry was carefully served a perfect steak, painstakingly prepared by the eminent chef. matsushita ate part of the steak that had been made for him. but then left most of it. those who watched from the kitchen appeared distressed and slightly heartbroken. they felt they had failed to impress their revered guest. and took it as a personal defeat that they had failed to deliver. the grandmaster of commerce asked to speak to the chef, which made the team even more nervous. all thought jobs would be lost and reputations ruined. yet something completely different happened. after the chef came out of the kitchen, matsushita said, with his head held low, in an aged and whispery voice, “please forgive me. your food was superb. i’m an old man so i don’t eat that much anymore. i just wanted to let you know this so you don’t think that i didn’t enjoy your exquisite food. i thank you. and i thank your fine team for your generous hospitality.” as you lead without a title and create the financial fortune that feels truest and most honest to you, i champion you to keep your feet on the ground. as you rise, grow even more modest. even more willing to learn. listen. invent. optimize. serve. and never, ever show off. it’s bad manners. and degrading to your greatness. do all that i’m suggesting and you’ll be assured of being at the top for a long time. and one of the primary goals when it"
sharma,"comes to success isn’t just to reach it. it’s to sustain it. ordinary producers aspire to reach the peak. legends are dedicated to remaining there for an entire career. so the generations who follow them know that they were there. my beloved father used to say this: “robin, the tree that bears the most fruit bows overs the most.” please think about that over the hours ahead. even in a society with people going out of their way to show you how smart, strong and rich they are, be a humble leader. and a grounded human being. oceanofpdf.com the investment with the highest return equities, precious metals, treasury bills, and real estate. these are where those who invest their money commonly land. fine. yet if you are serious about a major return on your investment, then i recommend that you invest far more in yourself. building your best you is your best investment, by a huge factor. it’s now popular to call it “self-care.” or classify it as “personal development.” or categorize it as “human optimization.” no matter how you label it, investing your focus, energy, knowledge, and time into elevating your mindset (your psychology), purifying your heartset (your emotionality), calibrating your healthset (your physicality), and upgrading your soulset (your spirituality)—what you now know as the interior empires from my methodology—is absolutely, unquestionably, and indisputably the finest investment you can make. the one that yields the highest returns. improving your mindset via reading, affirming, planning, and mvp (meditation, visualization, and prayer) each morning will dramatically raise your mental concentration, your creativity, your positivity, your resilience, and your productivity, as well as your overall sense of peacefulness (and nothing will cost you more than losing your peace of mind). increasing the wellness of your heartset through gratitude, periods of silence, journaling, working with a therapist, receiving regular bodywork, walking in nature, and hypnosis (as some examples) will significantly enrich your personal and professional relationships (because your emotional intelligence soars and your empathy for others shines), cause you to be far less reactive in stressful times, turn pain into power and transmute fear into multiple forms of fortune. raising the fitness of your healthset through a daily, sweaty, early morning workout, eating cleanly, supplementing correctly, carefully exploring fasting, sunbathing (in moderation), getting fresh air, napping, and sleeping richly will cause explosive gains in your energy, stamina, happiness, and performance, as well as noticeably extend your lifespan. and intensifying the intimacy with your soulset through the work of worship, spending time in careful contemplation, studying inspiring books, writing about who you wish to become, and being useful to others grows your personal heroism and expands your wisdom wonderfully. so i need to repeat it to reinforce it: your life always reflects you . as you rise, your outer conditions increase to match your new level of human greatness. i know this might sound esoteric and not practical. but it’s oh-so-practical. make you better and your income, influence and impact get (a whole lot) better. our culture teaches us the opposite. we are schooled into believing that when we get the worldly victories, we’ll somehow wake up feeling victorious as people. not true. the doorway to success swings inward, not outward. when you make the investment to create a majestic inner life by tending to the interior empires daily, your exterior results will offer you an exquisite return. oceanofpdf.com ask the billion-dollar business question there’s a question i’ve recommended that my clients ask their customers often. it’s a simple one. one that has made them, collectively, billions of dollars. i’ll share it with you, in the spirit of helpfulness. it goes like this: “thank you for telling me what you liked about your experience with us. now, please tell me what you didn’t like and, if you were in my shoes, how would you go about making things great?” really so simple. yet honestly so extremely valuable. trust me on this. it’s very rare for a businessperson to have the guts to ask for feedback and constructive input from the very individuals consuming their products and services, even though this information is the pure gold that will make them and their shop better, more successful, and more enduring. oh, and after you’ve asked the question, listen . i watch many people rush to rationalize why there were problems and make excuses as soon as the customer starts giving the feedback asked for. don’t do that. just ask the question and go completely quiet so your buyer can share all the insights that will—once acted on—take your business to a completely new level of success. and after you fully hear their first answer, then say “and what else?” so your customer shares more and more of the extremely precious information. the billion-dollar business question borders on magic. why? because most of us suffer from a dreaded affliction called fear of rejection. we only want to hear the positive. a consumer may share what they liked about doing business with you (because most human beings hate conflict, they’ll tell you about the good things that you want to hear) and then leave, never to return (if there were bad parts of their customer experience). then they will go tell all their neighbors and thousands of virtual friends what they didn’t like—destroying your reputation and brand in the process. if you go no deeper than listening for the positive, you’ll miss all the treasure. oceanofpdf.com silently adore your haters yes. i’m strange. i’ve not only encouraged you to bless your money, i’m now going to push you to adore your haters. i cherish my competitors and i appreciate my hurters and i salute my criticizers (not that i have many of them, thankfully). i really do love the concept of namaste that is so traditional in india, on meeting another person. the hands clasped together is a gesture that means “i bow to the divine within

sharma,"things to do is to give people gifts. i just love it! to be generous and caring and to put smiles on people’s faces is one of the highest joys of my life. and i’ve realized that although my presents are not given with the hope of receiving a gift in return, generosity is a form of seed-planting. the most surprising rewards will come your way when you commit to being a regular giver. when i was about six or seven years old, i adored a tv show called mr. dressup . the program ran for almost thirty years and was inspired by the renowned children’s series mister rogers’ neighborhood . mr. dressup (played by actor ernie coombs) had two best friends: a puppet child named casey and a puppet dog named finnegan—who, now that i think about it, looks a little like my dog superchum. when the puppeteer who controlled casey and finnegan decided to leave due to her concerns that children’s television was becoming too commercial, mr. dressup told his audience that his two buddies were no longer on the show because they went off to kindergarten. and when it came time for his final show, he didn’t tell all the kids who revered the series it was the last episode. instead, he adjusted his usual sign-off with, “we end each show by saying, ‘we have to go now. we’ll see you again soon!’ this last time that will be a lie.” one day when i was a boy, i scribbled a heartfelt and long letter to mr. dressup, letting him know how much he, casey, and finnegan meant to me. guess what? a week later, a postcard with a picture of the three of them showed up in my mailbox. on the other side was a warm note from the mentor who had taught me so much about life. as a little kid. over fifty years after receiving that gift—from a person who took the time to send a kind note to a little kid—i still remember the postcard. and the gesture from mr. coombs. … if i have an interesting conversation with a taxi driver, i’ll ask him to write his name and address on a piece of paper. and then, instantly (so i don’t postpone and possibly forget), i shoot a photo of the details using my phone camera and send them to my trusted executive assistant, angela, with a request to mail the driver one of my books. … if i have a neat chat with the barista in a coffee shop, i’ll often walk to a nearby bookshop, buy one of my favorite books, such as meditations by the roman emperor marcus aurelius, the giving tree by shel silverstein, or the catcher in the rye by j. d. salinger, and walk back to present it to them (with a nice inscription inside). … if i connect with the doorman of a hotel i’m staying at (which i often do), i’ll find a good wine shop and bring them back a lovely bottle of wine. to enjoy with their family. … if a sales clerk at a shop is great at what they do, full of positivity and overflowing with caring, i’ll go buy a bag of treats and return to offer it to them. (i’ll keep a little for myself.) as the french quaker and missionary étienne de grellet observed, “i shall pass through this world but once; any good thing therefore that i can do, or any kindness that i can show to any fellow-creature, let me do it now. let me not defer or neglect it, for i shall not pass this way again.” lovely. oceanofpdf.com increase your charisma i just read about bank collapses, more protests out on the streets and an earthquake that cost many beautiful human lives. all the volatility in our world worries me. yet i also know it’s in the most difficult times that true heroes emerge (so be one). as the writer christopher morley said, “you can curse the darkness or light a candle.” your passion is contagious and your personal energy can be magnetic if you do the right things. please remember that you have more magic within you than you are currently experiencing. here are seven ways to raise your charisma factor so you bring more inspiration to the world (and develop an even better social network): use people’s names. this is an utterly underrated way to genuinely build rapport with someone you seek to connect with. the psychological reality is that people feel happy at the sound of their names. it makes them feel seen, valued, and special. be on time. it’s better to be an hour early than a minute late. the ritual of punctuality sends a strong signal to the other person that they are respected. when you are on time, you show that you value the time of the person that you’re meeting. and demonstrate that you’re not a flake. have beautiful manners. oh, how inspirational it is to watch one of those rare-air leaders who display perfect manners. it makes them stand out, exude grace, and rise above the pack, where a lack of civility is as common as the air we breathe. smile sincerely. a human smile is a supreme connection accelerator. and a trust activator. no matter where you go in the world, even if you don’t speak the language, you can make friends and influence people sincerely and with integrity by giving them an honest grin. so do it more often. with practice, you’ll become your local smile master. be more interested than interesting . i’ll repeat this to reinforce it: you’ll never express the fullness of your natural charisma and leave people better than you found them if you’re so insecure that your main aim is to hog the spotlight. in a world of loud talkers, be a quiet leader. in an age of glitzy influencers, become the most generous person you know. i"
sharma,"know it’s counterintuitive, but the more you shine a light on others, the more the light will shine all over you. be vulnerable. the philosopher marshall mcluhan observed, “that which is most personal is most universal.” when you expose your scars and share your struggles, people begin to believe in you. they relate to you. you give them permission to be real. and deep bonds are developed. be an original. steve jobs’ turtlenecks. anna wintour’s large sunglasses. niki lauda’s red baseball cap. warren buffett’s hamburgers. mahatma gandhi’s loincloth. these are all examples of accessories used by standouts to, well, stand out. when done with authenticity and honesty, dressing or behaving in a way that is different from the majority, yet most true to you, significantly elevates your charisma. and makes you unforgettable in your field. by the way, this talk of originality makes me think of a story of something that happened at a tea party in honor of king george v at buckingham palace. a reporter—looking at mahatma gandhi in his loincloth and sandals—asked, “mr. gandhi, do you think you are properly dressed to meet the king?” the great hero’s reply was spectacular: “do not worry about my clothes. the king has enough on for both of us.” elle and i are going into the local village for a nice long lunch of burrata and pasta. so i should end this message right here. thanks for being so open to all i’m offering. i really do think you’re something special. ciao. oceanofpdf.com go see people in person at a time of nonstop online interactions, i strongly recommend that you maximize all opportunity for human connection, in person. i find it fascinating that we’ve never been so able to be united virtually, yet so many good souls among us have never been so lonely. it’s common to have a few hundred cyberfriends, yet much less common to have three friends you meet regularly for coffee or tea. once i read of a woman who would regularly fly ten tours for a sixty-minute meeting. “relationships are built by breaking bread together and connecting face to face,” she noted. in italy they say, “we are not friends until we’ve eaten together.” wisdom, yes?

ask them questions, eat their food, learn from their lessons, and listen to their stories (because everyone we meet has a lesson to teach and a story to tell if we have the courage to be open to them). the words attributed to mark twain speak to me deeply and i hope they’ll do the same for you: twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. so throw off the bowlines. sail away from the safe harbor. catch the trade winds in your sails. explore. dream. discover. oceanofpdf.com dig your well before you’re thirsty business pundit harvey mackay wrote a classic called dig your well before you’re thirsty . in it, he shares how carefully he treats human connections. how well he prepares—when underpreparation yet overexpectation is common before every single meeting—going deep into learning about the background, interests, and achievements of the person he’s about to greet. this consistently causes gaspworthy responses from harvey’s new contact. and starts the relationship off at a uniquely excellent level. perhaps more essential, he advises people to “dig your well before you’re thirsty.” develop mutually rewarding and profoundly fulfilling relationships not when you need something from someone but because the human connection will make their life and your life more prosperous. people are smart and we can sniff insincerity a thousand miles away. build your social community around being helpful, for the fun of the friendships and for the self-development that being around great people will bring you. never do it because you’re needy for a favor. or hungry for an opportunity. oceanofpdf.com don’t be a servant to your phone i hinted at this earlier, but i need to say it even louder: don’t use a phone in front of another human being you’ve committed to spend time with. if i’m having lunch with someone who keeps watching their social media feed or checking their notifications while we’re eating, i generally won’t hang with them again. the behavior basically says their scrolling is more important than our conversation and they have better things to do than have a chat with me. i was invited by the founders of a technology company to enjoy a dinner with them, as they wanted to use my content on their online education platform and have me represent their enterprise as their brand ambassador. all through the meal they checked their devices, took incoming calls, and watched short-form videos. their behavior was not only impolite, it showed me that they are addicts, unable to break free of their white screens for even an hour to interact with the person that they were hoping to have a partnership with. technology—intelligently used—is awesome. properly leveraged, it allows for great things to happen and can enrich your relationships noticeably. poorly handled, it can push people away and ruin your reputation. so don’t be a servant to your phone. become a master of remaining present. oceanofpdf.com make others feel special my life was transformed the day i stood in nelson mandela’s prison cell on robben island. to walk through the limestone quarry where he was forced to do backbreaking labor for thirteen years and to see the propaganda office where censors would hide or alter letters from his family as a form of psychological torture and to then—finally—be allowed into a tiny cell (there wasn’t even a bed in there) taught me what it means to turn pain into power and trouble into triumph. one thing i learned on the visit was that mr. mandela invited a guard who treated him with courtesy and respect to his inauguration as president of south africa—even though the statesman could have been angry and broken after twenty-seven years in confinement. later he said, “as i walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, i knew that if i didn’t leave my bitterness behind, i’d still be in prison.” i share this to remind you that your job as a human is to make people become bigger in your presence. small people try to show off, steal the spotlight, and act like the giant in the room. usually, they do this to compensate for their sense of insecurity. great souls make others feel great. make everyone you meet feel special. give them sincere praise and recognize their gifts rather than condemning their faults. live like this and you’ll not only have more friends than you could ever imagine, but you’ll experience a form of wealth well beyond anything money can buy. okay. we’re at the end of the sixth form of wealth—having a strong and superb community of splendid"
sharma,"people around you. you’re doing great (i need to tell you that). and i’m grateful to be your mentor from afar. how about we head into the next form of wealth? you’re going to find what you’ll learn really valuable, as i walk you through the hidden treasures of a life abundant with adventure. oceanofpdf.com the th form of wealth adventure the joy comes from exploring not possessing habit the important thing is not how many years in your life but how much life in your years. —edward stieglitz, artist oceanofpdf.com the th form of wealth adventure | quick overview too many good people among us really do live the same year eighty times and call it a life. getting up in the same way, thinking the same thoughts, being consumed by the same worries, walking to the same places, eating the same food, and seeing the same faces. we were not meant to live like this. adventure is our ancestry and one of your biggest opportunities to lead your richest life. adding more wonder into your days—whether through actual travel to new sites or simply by reading a book that transports you to new lands or taking a novel route to work or embracing a fresh routine—really is a currency of vast beauty. putting more awe, amazement, and excitement into your moments is a decision of wisdom that will make them into memories that you will treasure forever. rich memories are more valuable than cash money, you know. yes, my always growing companion on this journey into true success and authentic prosperity, leading a life filled with passionate pursuits and enthusiastic explorations is very much a form of wealth. we are most awake when we are exploring and progressing, voyaging and daring. we are closest to our best selves when we are living audaciously instead of cautiously. “it is not death that one should fear but never having truly lived,” said marcus aurelius, the glorious roman emperor. our society values owning a lot of things instead of making a lot of life. yet what’s the point of having tons of possessions, storage lockers full of items and a gigantic home if you’re mortgaging your happiness in the misguided pursuit of material things? you, i humbly suggest, were not meant to live complacently. we are, as human beings, made to be nomads and produced to be pioneers. you come from a long lineage of people who scaled mighty mountains, discovered vast oceans, and traded the comfort of security for the sometimes uncertainty that enjoying a wildly alive life demands. putting your personal passions ahead of your physical possessions will make sure that you never end up worldly rich but spiritually poor. this form of wealth that i’m about to take you through is very much about bringing the curiosity, fascination, and sense of magic back into your hours—by flooding your days with more enriching experiences and astonishing instances. so you don’t get to the end of your lifetime and realize you failed to live deeply. okay. we’re onto the short roads of my mentoring time with you. i’m going to miss you when it’s over. anyway, let’s not waste another second and head straight into the seventh form of wealth: adventure. oceanofpdf.com find your invisible panama you might find this instruction, which i write to you from the energy of a big city, cool. or maybe not (which is still cool with me). this morning after an early workout (during which i worked up a nice sweat while listening to the audiobook the wizard and the prophet ), i walked to get my coffee from a highly regarded café. i wound my way through the rain-soaked streets and past a soaring skyscraper that houses the offices and studios of a national broadcasting company. it was still dark and there wasn’t a soul in sight. i had the morning completely to myself! then i heard rock music. booming, actually. i thought it was from some sort of outdoor speaker that had been hung to entertain passersby. the song was “panama” by van halen. i raised a fist, as one must do at a concert in the presence of rock royalty, thinking no one would see me. as i continued to walk a few steps, it became clear that the sound was coming from a small minivan, a dodge caravan, actually. and the man inside had amped the song to please himself—and shake the ground, beneath his vehicle. he smiled at me as our eyes met. he’d witnessed my fiercely enthusiastic fist-raising gesture. and seemed to be amused by what i had done. the experience got me thinking. i’m not really sure, but my sense is that the man played the song as his elixir—to raise his spirits and create a few moments of glee before going into the concrete slab of a soul-crushing building to start his work. and that got me thinking further about all the very good people on the planet today who betray their true passions to do labor that makes them miserable, uncreative, and sometimes even sick. you might say, “but i have no choice—i have bills to pay.” sorry. you do have a choice. you do have power. you could start a side venture like beginning an online video channel that shares your wisdom and educates viewers, or handcraft the novel you’ve always wished to write and then self-publish it online. or open a pop-up shop to sell fantastic goods that light you up. or create an invention that solves a big problem that you yourself have been struggling with. and if you don’t know how to do this, then learn how to do this. i’m sure you can. another gentle piece of well-meaning advice that i’d like to reinforce: when you do what lights you up, you do your part to light up a brighter world for everyone. and when you push your magic into the universe, you model possibility for everybody. your life can"

they are like getting intimate knowledge of how a great human being did what they did from an autobiography but in under an hour, if you get my drift? from jiro dreams of sushi, i learned profound insights on mastery; from salinger , i discovered the history, habits, and hardships of a legendary writer. from amy , i realized how dangerous being around dangerous people can be, and from good fortune , i was reminded that a life spent without making other lives better is a life poorly spent. a good documentary allows you to enter into another person’s existence. you can learn why they dreamed their dreams, how they got them done, the tricky traps of fortune, and the heroic joys of overcoming defeat. you can take new voyages to fresh places through documentaries. and upgrade your inspiration in the process. the more you watch, the more ideas you’ll get on the highest way for you to live. then, filled with this knowledge, you can use each day as a platform to apply them. it won’t always be easy, but i can promise you it will always be worth it. oceanofpdf.com take a digital sabbatical may i suggest that, to improve your lifestyle and also feel more alive, at least one day a week you go completely free of technology? that means no phone, no social media, no chats, and no digital shopping for a full twenty-four-hour period. every seven days. to just live. to simply enjoy the basic, and often sensational, pleasures of your life. to be present (versus scattered) and centered (instead of stressed). to get lost in an unknown neighborhood or find a new bookstore. to test out a fresh food or walk barefoot in a secret park. to grow your love of the people around you who mean so much to you, and to maybe just get better at doing nothing. make a vow that at least one time a week from the moment you rise until the minute you sleep your devices will be turned off and placed in a drawer so they will be out of sight, so you can be awake. to wonder. to beauty. to nature. to the now. oh—there’s another powerful method that i need to share with you to cut down on the digital distractions in your life that drain your sense of adventure. i call it the two phone technique. have a main—fully loaded—phone that has all your social media, news, weather, and other apps on it. then invest in a second stripped-down phone that you carry when you are renewing or creating or doing anything that requires you to be completely focused. this way, you avoid being attached to and interrupted by your main one when you’d rather be doing something valuable—and essential. generations ago, once a week, people would take a day off (it was called a sabbath). no work, no worries, no doing—more being was the name of the game here. the practice refreshed people’s positivity and restored people’s aliveness. my genuine hope is that you will do the same. to reconnect with the wonders that abound in our volatile yet still majestic world. to rekindle your childhood spark. and to refill your empty well. oceanofpdf.com release the energy vampires we chatted a bit about this before. but i need to talk about it again as it’s so incredibly important to you enjoying the journey of this blessing called your life. and because good mentoring requires regular reinforcing. you can be happy or you can be with toxic people, but you will never, ever, ever be able to do both. all i’m saying is that if you want a strategy to transform your life almost instantly, say goodbye to all the people who make you feel bad. if they are a family member, then see them less often. if they are a friend you’ve had for years but they are no longer growing with you and no longer vibing with you because they are negative or entitled or constantly complaining, then go ahead and keep loving them, but at a distance. yes, release the energy vampires and detox from the dream vultures. free yourself from the happiness stealers. life is just too short to spoil your good days by allowing pessimistic people to enter them. oceanofpdf.com start a garden i once had a home that my family and i lived in for many years. i loved that place. because of the way the sunrise would shine at the front of it through the trees, and the way we could light a fire in the winter and then watch the sun set through the forest behind the house every evening. i liked the lightfall in the rooms, the fact that it was in a quiet area, and the reality that i could mountain bike late most afternoons in the woods nearby, after i’d finished my work. but one of the absolute best things about that place was its garden. i love flowers. they just fill me with contentedness and flood me with serenity. i found an expert to help me start the garden and i then began to care for it all spring and water the thing all summer. “the first year it sleeps, the seconds year it creeps and the third year it leaps,” i was told by the expert. and sure enough, at year three the lavender was lush, the coneflowers were luminous, and the tulips grew nearly"

(although if that sounds inspiring to you, definitely do it.) i just mean live again! by thinking often about all you need to become and taking the small, daily steps to make it all real so that by the time you’re done, the ride will have been fun. and exciting. and fulfilling. and worth it. recall that most of the fears that limit us from our glory are fake dragons and false dreams. we create our own prison bars through faulty thinking and then spend our greatest years trapped in jails of our own making. trust that there can be no progress without a few problems and no happiness without a few good fights. forget the need to please everyone . care for the call of your soul first. because you can’t give to others what you don’t have. and making your genius real sends a green light to all around you to do the same. so, yes, be a poet. express your artistry. embrace what’s risky. live more dangerously. look for more beauty. watch more sunrises, pick more flowers, eat more pizza, hug more people, dare more freely, and count the stars that dot the dark sky. if they came out only once in a generation, you’d behold them. but because they are always there, you may not even appreciate them. yes. be a who-cares-what-other-people-think poet. not just on paper. but within your richest life. oceanofpdf.com slow everything down join the slow movement. many people are into slow cooking, slow eating, and slow working (being far more patient, thoughtful and careful as they perform their craft). i recommend that you practice slow living . accept fewer requests to do things you really don’t want to do, buy less stuff, enjoy your days with fewer to do’s, make more time for interesting conversations, and pause to savor the obvious gifts of life most of us are so busy being busy that we miss. busier is mostly never better. breathe more slowly. chew more slowly. walk more slowly. talk more slowly. think more slowly and feel more profoundly. slowing everything down—versus speeding everything up and living like your pants are on fire—doesn’t mean you’re lazy. it only means you’re wise. oceanofpdf.com go ghost for a year i’ll now offer a strange yet perhaps fascinating and, i promise you, powerful idea: for an entire year, go dark. be hard to reach. go ghost. completely. yes, for twelve life-altering months, say no to most social invitations, refuse new friendship requests, stop shopping at stores, avoid going to restaurants, and pull back from the world. instead, enter the wilderness (of sorts), become a minimalist. get monomaniacally focused, centered and grounded on what i call in my mentoring methodology the vital few. … devote yourself to your personal growth and self-healing for a full year, understanding that the universe outside of you perfectly reflects the universe within. get brilliant at meditating, visualizing, praying, journaling, and releasing the limitations blocking you from living your promise and realizing your potential. … get into the fittest physical condition you’ve ever been in. run or do push-ups, discover yoga or start surfing, get more fresh air and give yourself more sleep. … read every book available in your field of expertise and practice your learnings for hours daily so you become so knowledgeable, valuable, and excellent that no peer can touch you. and no problem will ever stop you. … restrict your spending, reduce your needs, and scale your savings so you battleproof yourself from any sudden financial emergency or a global economic catastrophe (and increase the peace of mind that comes with having no debt). … simplify your life and streamline your days by shedding all things that steal your joy and confuse your priorities. … enjoy the classics, study your heroes, listen to gorgeous music, eat natural food, consume clean water, withdraw from any addictions (scrolling, overworking, complaining and drinking might be good places to start), and take long walks in the woods, as often as you can. … forgive the ones whom you need to"

upside down! he made this shift to “inverted painting” as he just wanted to do his own thing without the pressure of having to do what was expected by the art world. you too can be this free. your work can be a holy crusade—an enchanting odyssey into not only your finest creativity but toward your greatest self. because the projects that scare you make you stronger. and only the people who push past their limits get to know how unlimited they really are. oceanofpdf.com win the memory lottery “robin, i’ve come to the conclusion that too much money is a very bad thing,” one of the world’s wealthiest people told me as we walked by a river near a forest filled with wildflowers, deer and towering trees that must have been hundreds or even thousands of years old. “why?” i asked. “well, too much money is like a drug for extremely ambitious, driven, perfectionistic people like me. we keep on chasing it to make us feel like we’re winning. but we aren’t.” “then what is winning to you?” i asked, as a fawn leapt by. “making more memories, not more money. when i get old, i want to enjoy thinking about all the special moments i’ve had with my family. on my deathbed i won’t be able to take all the money i’ve made with me. i’ve never seen an armored truck at the end of a funeral procession on the way to a graveyard,” the billionaire spoke softly. making more memories instead of chasing too much money. what a wise focus for us. at this time within our culture where too many people forget that freedom means so much more than long numbers on a net worth statement. oceanofpdf.com do something scary every three months quick chapter for you here. i once had a sailing instructor who was one of the most alive, funny, and interesting human beings i’ve ever met. his name was bob. special man. cool dude. on a long sail one summer’s day, bob shared a strategy that kept him young and energetic, and made sure he never lost the sparkle in his eyes ( never lose the sparkle in your eyes). every quarter he’d do something that scared him and every two years he’d commit to learning a new skill that reinvented him. if you and i were on a sailboat together, i’d ask you carefully about all the things that you’re not doing because they frighten you. then i’d ask you to commit to accomplishing one, every three months. so you take back the power you gave to every one of those scary things. and next i’d ask you to list major skills that you’ve always dreamed of learning. and i’d gently yet firmly ask you to promise me you’ll work on mastering them. by working on them one by one, every two years. then i’d ask you a pretty gorgeous question that happy and terrific people often ask themselves: “when was the last time you did something for the first time?” finally, i’d ask you to help me set the sail. so we don’t get lost at sea. oceanofpdf.com pretend you’re a pirate speaking of the sea. i’d like you to pretend you’re a pirate. not a bad pirate, but a really good one (with nice teeth, decent manners and excellent habits). yes—i’m serious—to help you infuse your moments with the awesome experiences that make unforgettable memories— be a little more dangerous . “robin, what the heck are you talking about here?” you wonder. “why are you encouraging me to become dangerous ?” allow me to give you some examples of being slightly more of an outlaw than you currently are (unless you’re already a major outlaw, in which case i recommend you skip this chapter and move ahead to the next). … ask your romantic partner to give you exactly what you want and your friends to give you precisely what you need. … ask for the best table at your favorite restaurant if you see it’s available but the staff person is taking you to another one. … ask for the dessert that"

if we were having dinner together in my book-filled library, i’d ask you another top question: “what would the child you once were think of the grown-up you’ve become?” i chatted with a tech-titan client the other day who said he was happiest in his life when he’d go on extremely long bike rides at least a few times a week. i asked him why he no longer does them. he invested in working with me because he’s not very happy—and he admitted that the endurance rides made him so happy. “not sure,” he admitted. the luminary had allowed his heavyweight responsibilities and quest for elite achievement to distract him from one of the most precious treasures of a blissfully lived existence: having a ton of fun. he’d also forgotten that recreation re-creates us. pursuing the passions that feed our enthusiasm and activate our joy makes us so much happier, creative, and productive and peaceful. there’s no sense in putting off the doing of your passions until you’re too old to do anything about them. the majority of people are like that, sadly. they are rushing from place to place to keep up with their professional obligations, social commitments, and towering to do lists, ignoring the needs of their spirits in the process. the weeks will slip into months and the months into years and the years into decades. before they know it, it’ll be too late to do anything about the fascinations they put off. don’t let that happen to you, my dear friend. oceanofpdf.com less mastery, more mystery i just watched a short video of a man who—in the interview—was referred to as “the king of optimization.” he was called this because for years he pushed himself physically and productively to reach the absolute limits of what was possible. interestingly, he noted he’s now playing a different game. it’s less about “life hacks” to get more done and more about slowing down the speed of life and having more adventures. less about organizing his days at military-grade level and more about being free to wander (when he wants to) and rest (when he needs to). i was happy to see this. our civilization is going through a profound change. many of us are asking ourselves some big questions: who am i? what’s my purpose? what does real success look like? how do i wish to be remembered? mastery is important. most of us do want to realize our gifts and talents. and use our days productively (it’s a supreme source of happiness to exercise our creativity and produce results that matter) while polishing personal skills that build our confidence, raise our resilience, and grow us into our higher versions of our finest selves. yet as your mentor from afar who very much cares about you, i need to whisper this into your ear: forget not the magic . don’t be so busy being productive that you betray your soul’s longings and become boring, uninteresting, and lifeless. don’t be so serious that you stop laughing at silliness. don’t be so driven that you forget how to be human. walk into the mystery more often. maybe just by—once in a while—spending entire days wandering and wasting time and simply noticing things. or maybe you’ll drive to a foreign town you’ve never had the time to visit in all these years of being too occupied, and allow yourself to get lost there. or have a conversation with a shopkeeper about why they have spent a lifetime restoring old furniture. or enjoy a conversation with a nonna who has made extraordinary pasta for sixty-five years (can i come?). or with a farmer whose eyes glow when they speak of having the soil in their hands and their vegetables on another human being’s dinner table. maybe these suggestions to go see more awe and wonder don’t seem cool to you. that’s fine—go do what seems right for you. far too many of us are chasing a definition of success that was sold to us by our parents, teachers, and society. we’ve followed their orders. listened to their instructions. and where has it gotten us? too often to unhappiness, stress and in some cases illness (mental or emotional or physical or spiritual). do not live your parents’ life! or your neighbor’s way or by the method that influencers tell you you need to live to be"
sharma,"liked, accepted, and popular. live your life. it’s all you have—and you’re not going to get a second chance. all i’m saying, as country music plays a little too loudly here at the farmhouse and the homesteaders off in the distance are harvesting their olives with traditional tools of a bygone era, is this: a truly wealthy life is not always about the pursuit of mastery. mastery needs to be balanced with experiencing the miracles of the journey, more time in play, enjoying more magic, and leaning into the mystery. oceanofpdf.com stop salting your food before you taste it i was in a restaurant with a friend when something sort of special happened. i’d like to tell you about it. as i think the lesson i learned will serve you very well. we’d ordered and were speaking. the place was bustling, and the energy was awesome. when our lunch arrived, i picked up the pepper shaker and started shaking it all over my food. it’s just what i do. (so i like pepper. shoot me.) my friend started laughing at my eccentric pepper-applying habit. then he said, “henry ford would never hire you.” “what do you mean?” i asked as i chomped on my pepper-soaked food. he explained that legend has it that the iconic tycoon would take prospective employees out to lunch to study them. he not only paid attention to how they treated the waiters (because that says a lot about one’s character), he watched if they would salt and pepper their food before even tasting it. the mythology goes that if someone salts and peppers their meal before even testing it, it suggests three things about the person that makes them a bad hire: suggestion #: the behavior disrespects the assumed skill of the chef and the hospitality of the host who has taken you there. suggestion #: the person doing this makes decisions that are not based on any analysis whatsoever. hmmm. interesting. suggestion #: the culprit doesn’t have an open mind (and is set in their ways). i smiled. and went more lightly on the pepper, while realizing that i’m pretty much unemployable. yet there is a wise life truth here when it comes to the seventh form of wealth that i want you to work on: be not too deeply set in your ways if you seek to lead a fully inspired and deeply alive life. keep an open mind (as it never hurts to question the beliefs you have always been sure are true), challenge your assumptions about what is possible for you to experience, and fight any limitations that are keeping your bigness small. oceanofpdf.com happiness is an inside job so many good souls are trapped on the treadmill of telling themselves that they’ll be happy and enjoy life’s journey “when i.” … i’ll be happy when i find the ideal love partner. … i’ll be happy when i’m in radiant health and have sculpted abs and a snow-white smile. … i’ll be happy when i get the right car or have a hot job. … i’ll be happy when i have tons of money and financial freedom. … i’ll be happy when the pace of change slows, the political, social and climate disruption stabilizes, and the messes on our planet subside. sorry, but not even one of these items will ever make and keep you happy—that’s just an illusion sold to us by a society that in many ways has lost its way. they might bring you some short-term pleasure but that’s different from happiness . only something inside of you can make you happy. joyfulness is an internal state you create and a choice you make (by your daily thoughts, habits, behaviors, accomplishments, and adventures) instead of a thing that mystically happens some sunny morning when you find the right mate, house, job, or watch. oceanofpdf.com do a possessions purge mess creates stress. and having too many things around us drains us of our energy, distracts us from enjoying the present moment, and wastes our money on stuff we don’t need. so do a purge. a gargantuan one! give away clothes you haven’t worn in years, shoes you haven’t used in months, and trinkets that seemed like a good idea to buy at the time but now seem as valuable as a fortune cookie to a clairvoyant. the more you declutter, the more clutter you’ll notice around you. keep giving things away. let go of all the mess. clean sweep everything. simplify! follow my suggestion and guess what you’ll find? space will be made for all-new levels of creativity. your energy will accelerate and your precious feelings of personal freedom will take flight. “the greatest wealth is to live content with little,” instructed plato. may we cherish his wisdom. always. oceanofpdf.com my top books on leading a life of astonishment here are ten books that have assisted me in living a life of far less boredom, increased excitement, and a lot more wonder. i hope you’ll read each one of them and then act on the ideas you learn (because information unapplied is worthless). into the wild by jon krakauer small graces by kent nerburn the little prince by antoine de saint-exupéry hope for the flowers by trina paulus outsider by brett popplewell the giving tree by shel silverstein endurance by alfred lansing the water in between by kevin patterson a cook’s tour by anthony bourdain my last supper by melanie dunea remember the importance of less scrolling and more reading, for a gorgeous (and honestly wealthy) life. and that most of the fears that stop us from living full on are nothing more than lies scared people have taught us. oceanofpdf.com create an anti-hero scenario sometimes you need to shock yourself a little to make sure you never fall into a rut. to do this i’d like you to mildly terrify yourself by using a strategy from my methodology called the anti-hero scenario. it’s simple and it works beautifully."

sharma,"matters. your usefulness counts. your impact is worth so much. few virtues will give you as much personal fulfillment and inner peace as having a positive impact on many. “to live in hearts we leave behind is not to die,” wrote the poet thomas campbell. to sincerely improve lives and to make a key difference are the habits of heroes and the legacy of legends. and one of the major areas anyone who wants to lead their richest life concentrates on upgrading, constantly. just to reinforce, i’m in no way saying there’s anything wrong with making money, rising financially, and having marvelous material things. i’ve tried very hard since we first met to suggest that a gorgeous existence is all about maintaining a balance among all eight forms of wealth. okay. with this context, we need to start our journey together through the final form of wealth: service. so let us begin. oceanofpdf.com find a cause that’s bigger than yourself psychologist abraham maslow is famous for his hierarchy of human needs. if you haven’t seen it, the framework looks like a pyramid. at the bottom are the most basic needs of human beings, which he refers to as “physiological needs” (such as food and shelter). once these are satisfied, maslow said we then become able to rise to steadily fulfil the next levels of necessities: our “safety” needs (personal security, work, health and prosperity), then higher to our “love and belonging” needs and then up to “esteem” needs, which are all about self-respect and the desire for recognition and status. at the top of the popular framework is “self-actualization.” once all lower needs have been met, the thinking goes, we gain the strength, confidence, and personal armor to pursue the lofty and yet deeply important work of becoming all we are meant to be. to realize our potential. to live our gifts. to own our primal genius. here’s the fascinating thing: just before maslow died he decided to add one new level above self-actualization, at the peak of the pyramid. he called it “self-transcendence.” in other words, after living a full life, he realized that the highest hunger of you, me, and everyone else walking the planet today is to exist for something greater than ourselves. for a mission that transcends our self-centered needs. for a calling that leaves everyone we meet better than when we found them, and for a cause that makes some form of contribution. yes, as human beings we are invisibly hardwired to serve. and as we do so—even in the tiniest of ways—we light ourselves up. while we bring light into the world. too few of us reflect on our main aim and central purpose until too much time has passed to do anything about it. my sincere hope is that you never allow this to happen to you. oceanofpdf.com put your final day first “life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards,” observed philosopher søren kierkegaard. how true. it’s only when we are near the end that we can connect the dots, spot the patterns and sense that everything that happened—even and especially the hard events—served a splendid purpose. and followed a sort of masterplan. it was all soil for your growth, helping you learn the lessons you needed in order to grow into everything you were blessed to become in this lifetime. my encouragement today? put your last day first. yes, that’s my wish for you now, as your endlessly encouraging and always enthusiastic long-distance mentor. carve out some quiet time and, all alone, carefully consider the final day of your life. imagine you’re on your deathbed. see the faces of your loved ones. assuming you lived truly, energetically, bravely, happily, and genuinely wealthily, what are they saying as they celebrate your magnificently well-lived life? think through the accomplishments you need to have achieved and which explorations you feel you needed to have taken for you to know—as you take your last few breaths—that you applied your sharper talents and promise well. intimacy with your mortality is a powerful way to bring your vital few priorities into focus. and live to the point. as the eighteenth-century writer samuel johnson once wrote: “when a person knows they are to be hanged in a month it concentrates their mind wonderfully.” a confession: i used to read obituaries as part of my morning routine when i was a younger man. the discipline worked quite nicely to direct my hours to the pursuits that mattered most. few things increase our commitment to stripping out what’s trivial and doing what’s essential as the threat of death. sorry to say this yet i need to say it, to be of service to you. in all the obituaries of lives wisely lived that i read, not even one said, “he died in his sleep surrounded by his lawyer, accountant and investment adviser.” no. every single death notice of a human earthwalk done with optimism and wonder, vitality and integrity, joy and serenity said, more or less, the same kind of thing: they died peacefully in their sleep at a very old age, surrounded by the coworkers who respected them, the neighbors who appreciated them, and the family that adored them. and they passed on with a soft smile on their face. knowing they lived with authenticity, courage, creativity, and kindness. may i enthusiastically ask you now: if such priorities will matter most at the end, why not have the courage to make them your primary focus now? oceanofpdf.com memorize alexander the great’s last wishes a famous legend holds that alexander the great, on his deathbed, gathered his league of generals and shared with them his three final wishes. they were: that only the world’s best doctors should carry his coffin. that the vast economic wealth he’d accumulated over his lifetime (gold, precious stones, ornaments) should be scattered along the procession to the cemetery. that his hands should hang outside of his coffin for all who gathered"
sharma,"to view. one of his top generals asked him to explain the reason for these three instructions. here’s how the revered ruler replied: first, he stated that he wanted the finest doctors to carry the coffin so that all witnesses, and the population at large, would understand that even the greatest medicine available had no power to prevent a human being from dying. second, he wanted the streets to be littered with his gold and other forms of financial fortune so everyone in attendance would understand that money made on earth remains on earth after we die. and finally, he said that he wanted his hands to hang outside the coffin so that his followers would know—and never forget—that we are born with nothing and die empty-handed. may we memorize alexander the great’s three final wishes deeply. and then apply them to our lives quickly. so we experience the wealth that money can’t buy, immediately. oceanofpdf.com lead without a title short message here. for almost thirty years i’ve traveled the planet (from london to lagos, new york to nairobi, dubai to durban, and helsinki to hong kong), giving keynote presentations built around the idea that no matter where you live and no matter what you do, you can—if you choose—behave as a leader. because leadership is simply the opposite of victimhood. and people operating as victims (by complaining, blaming, and waiting for conditions to get better rather than exercising their natural power to make them better) never, ever have a positive impact. “everyone can be great because everyone can serve. you don’t have to have a college degree to serve. you don’t have to make your subject and your verb agree to serve. you only need a heart full of grace. a soul generated by love,” spoke martin luther king jr., a hero of mine. so go ahead. lead at work even if you have no formal position or weighty job title. lead at home, by encouraging, supporting, and cherishing your family (and being a rock in the storms). and lead in your community by behaving in a way that moves others to remember all they are meant to be. oceanofpdf.com trust the power of not caring this might be strange advice yet here we go: care a lot but don’t care too much . that’s what i’d say. and i’m not talking about being kind and treating people well. there, you do want to care too much. i’m speaking of protecting your peace and working with reality in such a way that you’re in the world but not really tied to the world. you’re doing your best but holding on to whatever happens with a very light (versus tight) grip—trusting that the universe knows what it’s doing and there’s a wonderful reason for everything that’s happening—even if you can’t see the beautiful benefit in this very moment. life unfolds not for your failure but always for your fortune, right? operate like this and you’ll become a sort of modern-day spiritual master. savoring the great seasons of your ride and trusting that in the mean ones your growth, bravery, and wisdom are forming. once you’ve got the lessons that your highest self has needed, all hardship shall pass. and the better days will begin. oceanofpdf.com your heart is wiser than your head we are in an ongoing battle: between our egoic selves and our heroic selves. between our birthright of freedom and the factory-installed programming of fear. between the instructions our good hearts constantly (though quietly) send us and the relentless suggestions our noisy minds bark at us. your egoic self is not the real you. it’s the part of you that’s been created as you’ve gone through life and been told by all the influences around you how to think, what to say and how to live. it’s the portion of you that has been formed by the hurts you’ve experienced, the disappointments you’ve endured, and the setbacks that you didn’t know how to turn into strengths. your ego is your shadow side. it’s suspicious, scared, and sometimes selfish. and it works almost daily to sabotage you from being your finest. your heroic self? well, that’s the real you. it’s rich with imagination insight, power, and love. it knows what you should do in every situation—for the benefit of all involved (not just yourself), is sure of your native greatness and is more undefeatable than our lower thinking can ever know. and this brilliant part of you understands that all of your heart’s desires are your heart’s desires because they are customized just for you—so you also have the ability to make them come true. i guess what i’m saying is that although it’s not “normal” to trust what your heart is telling you to do in this machine age, you really should. it’s so much wiser than what reason is selling you. it would be good to start following it more. oceanofpdf.com don’t let another’s bad day ruin yours you get up early. the streets are still. the world is yours. if you get what i mean. you do some exercise to bring your fire to life. listen to some music, maybe make a coffee or enjoy some tea. then you write in your journal about the things you’re grateful for to introduce greater cheerfulness to your day and note a few lines to guide how you’ll use the coming hours to bring you nearer to your vision of how it all needs to look at the very end. your morning routine has put you in a splendid mood. you’re thinking positively, feeling super strong, and set to make the day you’ve been blessed with great. then you meet another human. maybe it’s within your home. someone’s woken up cranky and wants to invite you into their negativity. maybe it’s a fellow commuter on the train playing their video game too loud. perhaps you walk into a bakery to pick up a cookie, greet the person behind the"
sharma,"counter happily and they just stare at you, ask what you want and hand it to you rudely. look, just because so many others seem to be in a bad mood much of the time doesn’t mean you should let them ruin yours. don’t plug into their energy and get pulled into their orbit. you have the power to protect your peacefulness, honor your intentions for each day, and live life on your terms (rather than in a way that grumpy people silently wish you would). because misery loves company. and dream stealers want you at their pity party. oceanofpdf.com recite the just like me peacefulness prayer i once heard the mesmerizing monk pema chödrön speak of a prayer she performs when irritated or angered by another person. she sits in silence, goes within, and then vows to forgive their bad behavior because “they are just like me.” i’m not sure if i’ve explained her exercise clearly or done justice to her wisdom. all i’m saying is that she finds serenity in a moment of unhappiness by realizing that the bothersome thing another person is doing is something she likely also does. and that connection with our common human weakness and communal imperfection provides her with tranquility. and causes her to relax, along with being of greater service to others. it’s ever so easy for all of us to sit on the summit of high judgment and the apex of self-righteousness on seeing another doing something we consider wrong. yet as we spend more time in reflection and awareness building, we often realize that we do the same thing. maybe the bad behavior of another of our brothers and sisters on this little planet looks slightly different from the thing that we do, yet the main idea here is that we too are regularly guilty of the very acts we find so troubling. given this, cut the wrongdoer some slack. who knows what they’ve experienced and what they are going through. and then, be kind to yourself. you’ve gone through a lot too. by engaging in the practice of praying for the power to forgive others because they are “just like me,” we relax. we breathe. we ground. we open. and then we arrive at the inner peace and outer positivity that helps us become more helpful to others. oceanofpdf.com see solitude as the new status symbol the celebrated sage paramahansa yogananda said these words: “seclusion is the price of greatness.” i absolutely love this. sometimes our egos and insecurities, fears and frustrations scream so loudly we can’t hear what our souls are saying. to carve out time for regular solitude is a holy act. to be alone and get supremely still is a sacred move. why? because in the quiet you’ll begin to reconnect to your truest self. the one that is honest when others are lying. the one that is brave when others are retreating. the one that is excellent when others are coasting. the one that is loving when others may be mean. yes, my special friend (i’m going to miss mentoring you on these pages), go to secluded places far more often. once there, consider what kind of a life you wish to construct. reflect on what values you want to represent. and pray for the strength to live out the remainder of your days inspiring, encouraging, and enriching the lives of all around you. oh, last point here: you can’t do your part to lead the world to a brighter place if you’re always in it. oceanofpdf.com apply the kindness always motto the writer and philosopher leo tolstoy (i’ll tell you one of my favorite stories of his soon) observed that “nothing can make our life, or the lives of other people, more beautiful than perpetual kindness.” want to remove your worries and dissolve all troubles? lose yourself in removing the worries and dissolving the troubles of others. by spreading kindness wherever you go. one of the top regrets of people at the end of their lives is that they wish they had treated their family, friends, coworkers, and strangers with more graciousness, gentleness, and generosity. when i was in my twenties, i was fortunate to have a mentor who taught me so much about what makes a rich life. he was impeccably well mannered, an example of excellence and a model of profound humility. at our last meeting before he passed, when i asked this extraordinary person for his advice on what is most important to being fully alive, he simply said, “be kind. robin, always be kind.” i’ve never forgotten my mentor’s wise words. i pray that you’ll remember them too. oceanofpdf.com doing a good thing is never a bad thing i was recently in a very poor part of the planet. it hurts my heart to see people struggling. anyway, as i walked to the town i came across a couple of teenagers hanging out by a bridge. “sir, buy me a drink, please,” the taller one said. i continued to walk, then stopped. and turned around, going back to the kids. “what do you mean by a drink?” i asked. “not alcohol, right?” “no, sir, just something to drink. or some food to eat. please.” “come with me,” i replied. “let’s go to the grocery store.” and so the tall teenager and i walked to the food shop. it was a fifteen-minute trek and while we made our way to our destination i asked him about his family and about his dreams and of his worries. once at the grocery store, he stopped at the entrance. i think he was concerned that they wouldn’t let him in, as his clothes were tattered and his shoes were torn. “come with me,” i suggested politely. he carefully followed me as we walked toward the deli. “do you like chicken?” i asked. he nodded. “very much.” “today’s my lucky day,” he then mumbled. “five barbecue chicken thighs and five drumsticks and five large salads,"
sharma,"please,” i said to the woman behind the counter with a hairnet and thick glasses that made her eyes look wider than they were. when i received the boxes over the counter, i handed them to the tall kid. he grinned a gargantuan smile. “thank you.” then he pushed his luck, as all young people should. “can i get a soda?” “no,” was my answer. “i’ll get you something healthy.” to his dismay, i picked up a few bottles of fresh orange juice and a carton of water. then we headed to the checkout. once i paid for everything, he took the boxes and we walked into the late morning sunshine. “good luck with everything,” was all i could think to say. “thank you,” was his response as he walked away with a lightness to his step. a bit later i met a friend who lives in the town. i asked if i’d done the right thing as i am not familiar with the culture and needed to know how things really worked there. “you did fine, but now they’ll ask you for food every time you walk by. you’re a soft target now,” he spoke, as he sipped a cup of coffee while standing on the street. i went for lunch and then started to walk back to the place where i was staying. as i passed a grassy field, i saw the teenager. he was laughing loudly and playing football with his friends. on seeing me, he called out, “sir, thank you! thank you for the food. and the juice. thank you. today was my lucky day! and my mates were very happy too!” no asking for more. no pushing for extra. no soft target, anywhere in sight. just a grateful human being. appreciating a small gesture. from someone who cared. look, i’m no guru and certainly no one special. but i will say this : it’s never a bad thing to do a good thing . in all these years of my sometimes hard life, almost everyone i’ve met has been inherently good. sure, people have bad days (or decades) and we all have weaknesses (and wounds) that need to be worked on. yet most people really have kind hearts and want to do well. so whenever an opportunity for decency presents itself, go ahead and seize it. you might not have the chance again. and helping someone in need isn’t just a gift you give to them. it’s one you deliver upon yourself. oceanofpdf.com reflect on the lost sovereigns law there’s a time-honored law i invite you to consider: almost every single king, queen, president, prime minister, emperor, great military warrior, and iconic leader of history is no longer remembered. they were the titans of their time. the luminaries of their age, treated as gods by the masses and revered by millions. now, shown to be mortal. and food for worms. today, you and i don’t know percent of them. we only remember a few of the truly monumental ones. the rest? anonymous. forgotten. pretty much irrelevant. it’s almost like they never even lived. gives us perspective, doesn’t it? even if we reach the pinnacle of success as our culture defines it, it’s highly likely that aside from getting a long obituary and having family and a few friends give testimony at our funerals, no one will be thinking of us even a few months after we’ve passed. given this reality, your job is clear: live your life. do your dreams. run your race. stop living in a way designed to fit in, pacify all and avoid being rejected by the herd (which mostly leads you astray). no one remembers most of those heroes of history. so why take so seriously the need to march with the majority that you fail to have the life the wisest part of you wants? oceanofpdf.com remember you only need six feet years ago, i used to share leo tolstoy’s short story “how much land does a man need?” within my leadership presentations. in it, a very greedy person becomes obsessed with acquiring more and more land in the place where he lives, to the point where he decides to move so he can possess even more. he hears about a faraway region where the property is incredibly fertile and of a fantastic quality. so he travels there, bringing gifts for the leaders and charms the chief. on meeting them, the man explains that he wants as much land as possible. the chief tells him that he can have as much land as he can cover by foot in a single day. the greedy property owner finds this deal a little odd but accepts the offer. the chief says that the deal comes with only one condition: before sundown, the man must return to the point where he started, otherwise he will lose all the land he has covered during the day. the man accepts and starts walking the land early the next morning. he walks briskly yet, in his avarice, picks up his pace so he can claim even more land. by midday, he is jogging so he can own even more property. by late afternoon he’s running. on the first signs of the sun starting to go down in the sky, the man gets worried, fearing that he might not make it back to his starting point before sunset. and lose all he has gained. he starts sprinting back to where he began, running faster and faster, as the sun sets lower and lower. soon he’s breathless and realizes that in his hunger for excess he has covered too much land. yet he refuses to give up. as the sun is close to moving beneath the horizon, the man sees the chief and his leaders on the hill waving to him and yelling at him to move even faster. so he does, eventually making it back to his starting place. the chief was delighted at the man’s feat."
sharma,"he had accumulated a wonderful amount of fertile land. terrific! but blood was flowing from the man’s mouth. his breathing had stopped. his eyes were shut. a grave was then dug for the body. six feet, from head to toe, was all the land the man truly needed. my point? helping is more valuable than acquiring. giving is more fulfilling than taking. and being useful is more satisfying than collecting. one of the things i’ve observed in the lives of history’s greatest souls is that each and every one of them had reached such a high level of consciousness that their dedication to becoming of service was far in excess of any desire to have possessions. i went to mother teresa’s mission in calcutta on one trip and, after being led through various rooms, was walked up to the place where she’d sleep each night. it was stunning how few things this woman—who was revered by the world and beneficial to millions—owned. a total minimalist. just an austere bed, spartan desk and not much else. empty bedroom. rich heart. good spirit. mahatma gandhi, another master of the ascetic lifestyle, had only six belongings at his deathbed, including his steel-framed glasses, a bowl, a plate, sandals, and his trusted pocket watch. material possessions simply held no attraction for him. he had arrived—through meditation, prayer, fasting, and working toward the freedom of his fellow citizens—at a state of being where his calling to serve gave him far more satisfaction than the showboating of a flashy car, the sporting of an expensive watch, and the owning of a home in a chic neighborhood could ever provide. again, do what’s best for you. that’s what i most want for you. but also know that real happiness, peace, and lasting personal freedom come from being a blessing to others and doing good things, while you travel through your days. and that someday in the oh-so-distant future all you’ll need is six feet of soil. oceanofpdf.com start a love revolution a favor to ask of you if you’re in the mood, ready to hear me and willing to do something that i think will considerably lift your sense of living with a passionate purpose: begin a love movement. yes, a movement. by taking the first step. mahatma gandhi’s salt march, which grew into an uprising of millions that played a giant role in nonviolently freeing his nation from foreign domination, started with him taking one step. alone. then the second person joined, then a few more, then tens of his brothers and sisters of his country, then thousands and eventually everyone got involved with his originally crazy dream. rosa parks wouldn’t go to the back of the public bus designated for people with darker skin during the sad days of racial segregation. the driver told the seamstress that he’d have her arrested if she didn’t do what she was told. “you may do that,” she replied softly and with deep dignity. her act of defiance led to a boycott of buses, which led to marches and protests, which ignited the civil rights movement. i want you to begin your own revolution. yes, i really do! one based on love. (guitar virtuoso jimi hendrix said, “when the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace.”) and on the reminding of others to be more caring, respectful, polite, cheerful and endlessly forgiving, start small. take little steps on your march. make some symbolic gesture to attract more followers. and don’t stop until you’ve fulfilled your mission. to change the world. oceanofpdf.com the high road is the best road this morning, i was fed a short video where the social media influencer yelled, “put yourself first or else you’re a loser who will be taken advantage of.” yesterday, i heard a top pundit share that he measured his success by how many people will attend his funeral. last week, i heard a leader talk about the nature of worldly power and the moves to make to snatch it from others, manipulate those you deal with, and reach the mountaintop of having it all. look—and i’d like to be clear—the great thing about a human life is we each get to have our own opinions. and i very much respect the right to free speech. yet i just see the universe ever so differently from so many. i guess you do too. that’s why we vibe, right? and i need to add my views to the conversation so you can consider them here, then form your own conclusions and find a truth that fits best for you. so here i go… …a strong, wise, great human being is one who cares deeply about the welfare of others. of course, be not a doormat. for sure, if you allow people to take advantage of you, some will do so. that’s obvious, so don’t be naive, please. yet i don’t think that making it all about you will ever bring you the self-honor, happiness, and sense of serenity i know you seek. if you’re good and someone takes from you, you’re the victor—not them. because you got to be good. and… …why does it matter how many people show up at your funeral? you’ll be dead. what if no one shows up to mine? who cares? why is this a metric of success? my guess is that vincent van gogh died alone. does that make his life unsuccessful? no, it was remarkable . to me, the man is a hero. what of the gardener or the gravedigger who lives quietly and with intense integrity, doing their work with dignity—and living with civility, wisdom, compassion and honor—who leaves the earth with only a few at their funeral? winners in my book. absolute champs. and… …why does being powerful all too often mean stepping on others so you can rise? isn’t that hard on your heart and supremely bad for your soul? is it just me or do you"
sharma,"feel me? isn’t being honestly powerful all about lifting others up versus tearing people down? and helping people own their giftedness instead of advertising loudly about yours? and being a shining light on this planet with far too many shadows? i just don’t think you’ll get all you want following the kind of advice those well-meaning gurus are offering. instead, i suggest you become sure of these not-so-normal truths: … caring is cool. … politeness is hip. … reliability is hot. … humility is groovy. … frugality is sexy. … patience is potent. … selflessness is sensational. i’ll end with a precious story on this point about the importance of always taking the high road to an excellent, joyful, and really wealthy life. spanish athlete iván fernández anaya was running second in a cross-country race in the navarre region of northern spain in . in the lead was top runner abel mutai, who had won the bronze medal at the london olympic games. incredibly, mutai—who was certain to win—stopped ten meters before the finish line, mistakenly believing he had crossed the line. rather than speeding past the leader for a clear victory, fernández anaya stopped and encouraged his confused competitor to keep running so he could claim his well-earned prize. “i didn’t deserve to win,” observed the twenty-four-year-old spanish athlete. “he was the rightful winner. he created a gap i couldn’t have closed if he hadn’t made a mistake.” that kind of character and selflessness is a pleasure to witness. it’s sort of magical. let’s celebrate the high road—and always head up to it. oceanofpdf.com eat your last supper today to add more meaning to your days, i recommend that you define your last supper. and then go eat it. on the weekend that just ended, elle and i were in rome. on a trip, i prefer to eat a wonderful lunch and then have little to no dinner. this makes for a really fun day and a healthy, quiet evening (that promotes deep sleep). this way of eating also easily allows me to be up early the next morning to pray, meditate, exercise, journal, and read—which pretty much guarantees that the next day is another good day, if that makes sense to you. we invited two of our friends to join us for lunch at one of my favorite restaurants. it’s located close to campo de’ fiori—a square where the legendary sixteenth-century thinker giordano bruno was burned alive for spreading revolutionary ideas. but that’s another story that i’m saving to tell you, maybe if we get to meet in person sometime in the future (i’d like that). we all ate the small-plated roman delicacies. oh, that burrata! it’s an italian cow’s milk cheese that’s formed from cream and mozzarella. it contains stracciatella, which is a creamy, gooey, marvelously textured morsel of heaven. quite divine. exceptionally simple. about two hours into what would become a four-hour meal rich with laughter, deep talk and light chat, i asked the table, “what would you eat for your last meal?” i thought it was an interesting question to stimulate fascinating conversation. my friend—who is an iconic dj—immediately leapt into action, speaking of his favorite pasta, meat grilled on an open fire and the side plates he’d definitely enjoy. each of us had our fun. we covered a lot of food. when my turn came, i admitted i’d eat my dessert first (fresh ricotta cheese with raw honey drizzled delicately over it, please). “what’s your point here, robin?” you wonder of your endlessly dedicated yet aging mentor. “easy,” i’d gently reply. “the more you can remember the shortness of life and reconnect with your mortality — in a culture of being nonstop busy—the more power you’ll have to say no to any invitation that doesn’t really get you closer to where you want to be in the twilight of your lifetime. and the more strength you’ll have to choose only those essential exploits and key opportunities that will get you to a place called amazing.” you can start by defining your final meal. and then fully enjoying it. tonight. oceanofpdf.com do three anonymous acts of goodness today, go out into our jaded, crisis-filled, and all-too-often selfish world and do three basic yet beautiful acts of humanity for three people who won’t even know that it was you (anonymous generosity is the only type that means anything). anne frank wrote in her diary, “no one has ever become poor by giving.” and writer neil gaiman said, “i hope you will dream dangerously and outrageously, that you’ll make something that didn’t exist before and that you will always be kind.” i’m not sure what three acts of goodness will most speak to you and which three you’ll make the time to do this day. what i do know, though, is that decency has a domino effect, moving its receivers to be more caring as they advance through their hours. yes, you really can improve the world. one person at a time. i recently had a conversation at a barcelona hotel with an always smiling doorman named alberto. i mentioned that, by his usual positivity, if he left one hundred guests and passersby a day better than he found them, after five days he will have influenced and uplifted five hundred humans. i continued: “alberto, that’s two thousand a month and twenty-four thousand people in a year.” he was silent. he looked up at the sky. i would not stop, adding, “after ten years your goodness and grace will have touched nearly a quarter of a million people.” tears began to fill alberto’s big blue eyes. right there. straight in front of me. on that elegant street in barcelona. definitely think about this: being good to just three people a day means you will uplift ninety human beings in one month, one thousand and eighty in one year, ten thousand eight hundred in a decade, and almost one million people by living the normal lifespan (i hope"
sharma,"you’ll live far longer, though). for sure, you can make that magnificent a difference. in many ways, though you may not know it, you already do. oceanofpdf.com you matter much more than you know no one alive right now, in this very moment, is unnecessary. each of us has talent, wonder, and astonishing powers within us. everyone matters. everyone has an impact on the world. and yes, that does very, very, very much mean you. our society places billionaires, sports stars, and celebrities on a pedestal. many travel in motorcades, receive vip treatment, and are greeted with overflowing crowds of admirers seeking selfies everywhere they go. yet what about the sensationalism of the single parent working three jobs to put food on the family table and even, amidst the struggle, keeps a smile on their face, always staying a great example to their children? or how about the librarian, teacher, nursing home assistant, or street cleaner who works quietly, for the benefit of many, who receives no fame, fortune, or applause yet softly influences people’s lives? should we not put their names in lights, seek their autographs, cheer at their efforts, and erect towering monuments to cherish their commitments? all i’m saying is that we live in a period that mostly reveres the wrong things. and that brings me back to you again. i’m not sure where you are on your life’s process—whether you’re at the summit or in the valley. but i do very much wish to remind you—intensely—that you do have magic within you, potential that needs to be realized, and a very real ability to impact humanity in a big, bold way. or maybe simply in a tiny fashion, which is certainly just as valuable. oceanofpdf.com have a living funeral it’s such a waste to have people speak of your conviction, achievements, and courage after you’re dead. you’ll be six feet under or a pile of dust in an urn above a fireplace, so you won’t be able to hear their tributes. my suggested solution? have a living funeral. yes. i’m not kidding. a living funeral. schedule a time. send out the invitations. buy the cake (chocolate would be best). maybe put fresh daisies on it (as weird as that would look). tell those you love of your experiment. that you wish to live like you’re dying. that you are excited to exist more vividly, creatively, and enthusiastically—by performing this ritual to remind yourself that life passes in a blink. let your loved ones know that you need to pretend you’re dead. to remind you of life, in all its fragile glory and delicate majesty. then explain that you want to bring together the people most important to you. to hear what they think is best about you. to tell them how you feel about them. for you to speak of the lessons you’ve learned, the trials you’ve endured and the triumphs you’ve enjoyed. to talk of love and how much those gathered mean to you, thanking each of them for the blessings they have given you. makes me think of a story i studied while i was writing the monk who sold his ferrari , oh-so-many years ago. there was once a great maharajah who had a most curious morning practice: he’d enact his own funeral—complete with music and flowers. and all the while, he’d chant, “i have lived richly and passionately, wonderfully and helpfully.” when i asked my beloved father why this man would run this routine—at every sunrise—my father replied with a wise smile: “robin, that’s easy. this man has developed a ritual to remind himself at the beginning of each day that this day could be his last. the maharajah developed this method to connect him to his mortality. and to remind him that this day could be his final one, so he’d live it completely and on his own terms.” yes. have a living funeral. it just might be your new birth day. oceanofpdf.com live fully so you can die empty i’m going to miss you. thank you for allowing me to be of service to you, as you create a life filled with real riches and genuine wealth—one i’m sure you’ll be very proud of at the end. i’m at the old farmhouse as i write you this last message. i feel most grateful for my time with you. it’s a sort of cold morning. a sweet country song plays. the birds sing and my weary eyes see a mist floating above the hills on the distance, beyond the olive grove. my heart tells me great gifts are coming to you and your future looks oh-so-blazingly bright. congratulations. you deserve the best of everything, my special long-distance friend. i won’t take up much more of your time. i do hope our journey together has left you inspired, enriched, and absolutely dedicated to applying all i’ve humbly offered you, so it forms a part of your days. and becomes your new way of life. what i most wish for you can be said quite simply though: live fully so you can die empty . makes me think of what george bernard shaw once wrote: this is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. i want to be thoroughly used up when i die, for the harder i work the more i live. i rejoice in life for its own sake. life is no “brief candle” for me. it is a sort of splendid torch which i have got hold of for the moment, and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations. thanks again for spending time with me in my messy writing room—along with my little dog superchum (who’s right next to me now,"
